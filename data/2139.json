Find all our coronavirus-related coverage here, and let us know your thoughts here. For the past few weeks, most of us have been collectively hunkering down, with our perpetually busy lives now taking place within our homes 24/7. Suddenly, for the first time in a very long time, we're actually taking a good look at those walls. And if your walls are anything like ours, they need some brightening. (Maybe a coat of paint, too, if we're being honest.) What's the quickest way to revitalize a lackluster space? Artwork. The great news is that art is incredibly accessible right now. Whether you're a longtime watercolor lover, a photography buff or a die-hard abstract fan, there's a massive amount of really awesome artwork online that is also insanely affordable. Seriously. You can curate a full gallery wall of interesting prints for under a hundred bucks. Or you can buy a huge, wall-dominating canvas for under $200.  We've rounded up some of our favorite places to shop for art, from mass retailers like Nordstrom and Wayfair to artist-representing collectives like Iamfy, Society6 and Etsy. We also went ahead and picked a few top sellers from each site, rounding up everything from a dazzling abstract print representing dawn in South America to a stretched canvas of a flamingo wearing Nike high-top sneakers that nearly 15,000 people have \"liked.\"  If we're all going to be spending a lot more time inside our abodes going forward, we might as well make them look as happy as possible, and let's face it: Art makes us happy. And we need all the happiness we can get in our lives right now.
