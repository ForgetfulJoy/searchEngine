They held replicas of his jersey and chanted \"Kobe.\" Watch the moment:  Michael Enriquez, from Santa Barbara, California, has been a Kobe Bryant fan all his life and was here for his jersey retirement ceremony. The memorial today, though, was vastly different. \u201cThe jersey retirement was like a celebration for him,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just heartbreaking.\u201d Still he said it was a great experience to be here: \u201cI\u2019m never gonna forget it,\u201d he said. He brought his son Michael, Jr., who said the event want \"cool.\" Meanwhile, Dianna Rodriguez, pictured below, said the event gave her a sense of peace \u2014 especially because his death was bigger than basketball. \u201cIt was a way for everyone to ... accept what happened and accept his life,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed it for sure. I\u2019ve been a mess the last month.\u201d Stacey Lopez said Kobe\u2019s wife Vanessa\u2019s speech was the most meaningful. \u201cShe speaks to every mother out there, every wife out there,\u201d she said. The NBA just tweeted out a photo of Kobe and Gianna Bryant with a heart. Here's the tweet:  The crowd at the Staples Center erupted with chants of \"Kobe\" as the memorial service for the late basketball player and his daughter came to an end. Nat King Cole's \"Unforgettable\" played as a number of people waited in their seats, soaking in the final moments. Watch the moment: ##Kobe## Christina Aguilera took the stage at Kobe and Gianna Bryant's memorial service to perform \"Ave Maria.\" The six-time Grammy Award winner received a round of applause. Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant's teammate and NBA Hall of Famer, talked about his years playing with Bryant on the Lakers, where they won multiple championships together.  \"We fought and we\u00a0bantered back and forth with\u00a0offhanded remarks, but make no\u00a0mistakes, and you folks thought\u00a0we were on bad terms, and when\u00a0the cameras were turned off we\u00a0would wink at each other and\u00a0said, 'let's go whip some ass.'\" Shaq told the Staples Center crowd about the day Kobe \"gained my respect.\" \"Kobe and I always maintained a\u00a0deep respect and love with one\u00a0another.\u00a0The day Kobe gained my respect\u00a0was when the guys were\u00a0complaining, and they said,\u00a0Kobe's not passing the ball.\u00a0I said I will talk to him.\u00a0I said, Kobe, there's no \"I\" in\u00a0team, and he said, I know, but\u00a0there's a \"Me\" in that\u00a0m**********r.\" Shaq said he went back and told his teammates: \"Just get the rebound, he's not\u00a0passing.\" ##Kobe## NBA great Michael Jordan said Kobe Bryant's death had a huge impact on him and the world. \"When Kobe Bryant died, a piece\u00a0of me died,\" Jordan said.\u00a0\"And as I look in this arena and\u00a0across the globe, a piece of you\u00a0died or else you wouldn't be\u00a0here.\" He then made a promise to Bryant: \"I promise you from this day\u00a0forward I will live with the\u00a0memories knowing that I had a\u00a0little brother that I tried to\u00a0help in every way I could.\u00a0Please, rest in peace, little\u00a0brother.\" ##Kobe## Michael Jordan \u2014 who cried as he gave a tribute to Kobe Bryant \u2014 joked that there will soon be another crying Jordan meme. A picture of Jordan crying has been used to ridicule losing teams and their fans.  \"We talked about business.\u00a0We talked about family.\u00a0We talked about everything.\u00a0And he was just trying to be a\u00a0better person,\" Jordan said of Bryant through tears. \"Now he's got me, and I'll have\u00a0to look at another\u00a0crying\u00a0meme\u00a0for the next\u2014\" he said, but was cut off from audience applause and cheers. \"I told my wife I wasn't\u00a0going to do this 'cause I\u00a0didn't want to see that for the\u00a0next three or four years.\u00a0But that is what Kobe Bryant does to me.\" ##Kobe## NBA legend Michael Jordan got tearful as he talked about Kobe Bryant's legacy. \"Maybe it surprised people that\u00a0Kobe and I were very close\u00a0friends, but we were very close\u00a0friends.\u00a0Kobe was my dear friend.\u00a0He was like a little brother.\u00a0Everyone always wanted to talk\u00a0about that comparisons between\u00a0he and I.\u00a0I just wanted to talk about\u00a0Kobe,\" he said. Jordan recalled how Bryant would often call or text him in the early-morning hours to talk about basketball. \"At first it was an aggravation,\u00a0but then it turned into a\u00a0certain passion.\u00a0This kid had passion like you\u00a0would never know,\" he said. Bryant, he said, wanted to be \"the best\u00a0basketball player that he could\u00a0be.\" \"As I got to know him, I wanted\u00a0to be the best big brother that\u00a0I could be,\" he said. \"To do that, you had to put up\u00a0with the aggravation, the\u00a0late-night calls or the dumb\u00a0questions.\u00a0I took great pride as I got to\u00a0know Kobe Bryant, that he was\u00a0just trying to be a better\u00a0person, a better basketball\u00a0player.\" ##Kobe## Alicia Keys played Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" during the service. It was one of Kobe and Vanessa Bryant's favorite pieces. Moments ago, Kobe Bryant's friend Rob Pelinka said the basketball legend once vowed to teach himself to play the piece to show his love for his wife. Kobe Bryant was not a trained musician\u00a0\u2014 but that wasn't enough to stop him, Pelinka said.   \"Kobe's passion and love for\u00a0Vanessa and the focus that only\u00a0the Black Mamba has made this\u00a0seemingly impossible goal a\u00a0reality,\" he said. Rob Pelinka \u2014 the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers, Kobe Bryant's former manager and the godfather of Gianna Bryant \u2014 said he was texting with Kobe just minutes before the deadly helicopter crash. Kobe had texted him asking if he knew a certain baseball agent in California. Kobe wanted to help a friend get his daughter a baseball agency internship, and he vouched for her work ethic, Pelinka said. \"He clearly wanted to champion a bright future for her,\" he said. Pelinka said he texted that he'd help however he could \u2014 and moments later, the helicopter Kobe and Gianna were on crashed.  The girl Kobe had been texting about was Lexi Altobelli, the surviving daughter of coach John Altobelli, who also died in the crash.  \"Kobe had been texting me from\u00a0the helicopter,\" he said. \"Kobe's last human act was heroic. He wanted to use his platform to\u00a0bless and shape a young girl's\u00a0future.\u00a0Hasn't Kobe done that for all of\u00a0us?\" ##Kobe## Geno Auriemma, a coach for the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, recalled the moment Kobe Bryant asked him for advice on coaching his daughter, Gianna. \"The uncoachable one wants to\u00a0talk about coaching.\u00a0Probably the most uncoachable\u00a0player in the NBA during his\u00a0career wants to know about\u00a0coaching, and I wanted to know\u00a0why.\u00a0He said, 'I'm coaching my\u00a0daughter's team.'\u00a0I said, 'Oh, my God.\u00a0That poor kid,'\" Auriemma said. Auriemma said while Bryant was NBA royalty, he stepped back from the limelight to allow his daughter to shine. He went on to say the Bryant was being dad.\u00a0 \"He wasn't being Kobe Bryant.\u00a0He was allowing Gigi to be Gigi,\u00a0not Kobe Bryant's daughter,\" Auriemma said. ##Gianna## Sabrina Ionescu \u2014 a college basketball player for the Oregon Ducks who taught Gianna Bryant \u2014 said the 13-year-old basketball player was the future of the game. \"Whichever school she would come\u00a0to choose, it doesn't matter. If I represent the present of the\u00a0women's game, Gigi was the\u00a0future, and Kobe knew it, so we\u00a0decided to build a future\u00a0together,\" she said. Ionescu said she grew close to both Kobe and Gianna after he brought his daughter to a college game.  She added: \"I\u00a0wanted to be part of the\u00a0generation that changed\u00a0basketball for Gigi and her\u00a0teammates, where being born\u00a0female didn't mean being born\u00a0behind.\u00a0Where greatness wasn't divided by gender. 'You have too much to give to\u00a0stay silent,'\u00a0that's what he said, that's what he believed. That's what he lived through Gigi, though me, tough his investment in\u00a0women's basketball. ##Gianna## Vanessa Bryant closed out her emotional tribute with a message to her late husband: \"Babe, you take care of our Gigi.\" \"We love and miss you, boo-boo\u00a0and Gigi,\" she said. \"May you both rest in peace and\u00a0have fun in heaven until we meet\u00a0again one day.\u00a0We love you both and miss you\u00a0forever and always, mommy.\" ##Kobe## Four-time Olympic medalist and Bryant family friend Diana Taurasi gave a speech remembering Gianna and Kobe. \"Watching Kobe play at the Great\u00a0Western Forum as a rookie made\u00a0this little girl believe she\u00a0could be a Laker one day,\" Taurasi said. \"He made it OK to play with an\u00a0edge that borderlined crazy.\u00a0Early on the Mamba mentality was\u00a0in full effect.\u00a0Years later when I spent time\u00a0with Kobe at the Olympics, I\u00a0learned firsthand it was not\u00a0limited to the basketball court,\" she added. Taurasi promised to carry Gigi's legacy, saying, \"Gigi in many ways represents the\u00a0future of women's basketball, a\u00a0future where a young woman\u00a0aspires to play in the WNBA the\u00a0same way I wanted to be a Laker.\" \"She represents a time when a\u00a0young girl doesn't need\u00a0permission to play.\u00a0Her skill would command respect,\" she said of Gigi's legacy. ##Gianna## Vanessa Bryant recalled the time Kobe gifted her the blue dress worn by Rachel McAdams in \"The Notebook.\" She described in detail her relationship with Kobe, saying he was \"the romantic one.\" \"I looked forward to Valentine's\u00a0day and our anniversaries every\u00a0year.\u00a0He planned special anniversary\u00a0gifts for every year, and he\u00a0thought outside the box and was\u00a0so thoughtful even while working\u00a0hard to be the best athlete,\" Vanessa said. One of those gifts, she said, was dress from the \"The Notebook.\"  \"And it was because it was the\u00a0scene when Allie comes back to\u00a0Noah,\" Vanessa said. \"We hoped to grow old together\u00a0like the movie.\u00a0We really had an amazing love\u00a0story.\u00a0We loved each other with our\u00a0whole beings, and two imperfect\u00a0people raising a beautiful\u00a0family.\" She went on to describe how he loved watching tearjerker films like \"Step Mom,\" \"Steel\u00a0Magnolias,\" and \"Little Women.\"\u00a0 \"He had a tender heart,\" Vanessa said. ##Kobe## Vanessa Bryant described her late husband as \"the MVP of girl dads.\" Bryant went on to say he was \"doting\" father\u00a0\"that was hands on and present.\"  \"Kobe was the MVP of girl dads,\u00a0or mvd. ... He always told the girls how\u00a0beautiful and smart they are.\u00a0He taught them how to be brave\u00a0and how to keep pushing forward\u00a0when things get tough,\" she said. She recalled how he helped her bathed their youngest daughter almost every night. \"He would make them laugh and\u00a0smile as he got them ready for\u00a0bed.\u00a0He had magic arms and could put\u00a0Capri to sleep in only a few\u00a0minutes, and he had it down to a\u00a0science, eight times up and down\u00a0our hallway,\" Vanessa said. ##Kobe## Vanessa Bryant said her daughter Gianna advocated for equal pay for professional female athletes \u2014 even though she was just 13 years old. Gianna Bryant, who was also known as Gigi, dreamed of playing in the Women's National Basketball Association.   \"She would have made a huge\u00a0difference for women's\u00a0basketball. Gigi was motivated to change the way everyone viewed women in sports,\" Vanessa Bryant said. She added: \"She wrote papers in school\u00a0defending women and wrote about\u00a0how the unequal pay difference\u00a0for the NBA and WNBA leagues wasn't fair, and I truly feel she made positive changes for the WNBA players now, since they knew Gigi's goal was to eventually play in the WNBA.\" ##Gianna## Several celebrities and NBA athletes are in attendance at the memorial service. Here are few we've seen so far at the service: Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez\nAnthony Davis\nJames Harden\nPhil Jackson\nMagic Johnson\nLamar Odom\nPau Gasol\nKris Jenner, Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver\nShaquille O'Neal\nDwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union\nSteve Nash\nRussell Westbrook\nPaul Pierce\nStephen Curry\nBill Russell\nDwight Howard Vanessa Bryant, Kobe Bryant's widow and Gianna Bryant's mother, started her remarks at the memorial by remember her \"baby girl.\" She said Gianna Bryant \u2014 also known as Gigi \u2014 would kiss her good night and good morning daily. Even on mornings when Vanessa was still sleeping, Gianna would kiss her while she was asleep. \"She was so thoughtful to\u00a0remember to kiss me every day,\" Vanessa Bryant said.\u00a0\"She was daddy's girl but I know\u00a0she loved her mama.\" ##Gianna## Vanessa Bryant fought back tears as she took the stage at her late husband and daughter's memorial service at the Staples Center. \"Thank you all so much for being\u00a0here.\u00a0It means so much to us.\u00a0Love you, too,\" she said as the crowds applauded and cheered. \"First I'd like to thank everyone\u00a0for coming today.\u00a0The outpouring of love and\u00a0support that my family has felt\u00a0from around the world has been\u00a0so uplifting.\u00a0Thank you so much for all of\u00a0your prayers.\u00a0I'd like to talk about both Kobe\u00a0and Gigi, but I'll start with my\u00a0baby girl first.\u00a0My baby girl,\" Vanessa said. She is speaking on stage right now. Jimmy Kimmel gave a heartfelt speech before introducing Vanessa Bryant. Despite holding back tears, Kimmel managed to get a laugh out of the audience saying, \"In places where you would be\u00a0booed on the court, Kobe is\u00a0missed.\u00a0Even the great Boston Celtic\u00a0Bill Russell wore No. 24 on a\u00a0Lakers Jersey to yesterday's\u00a0game.\u00a0I knew he would come to us\u00a0eventually.\"\u00a0 Kimmel ended his speech encouraging everyone to embrace each other, \"So since we are here today to\u00a0celebrate, I'd like to invite\u00a0you right now to take a moment\u00a0to say hello to the people\u00a0around you, whether you know\u00a0them or not, to be grateful for\u00a0life and for the fact that we\u00a0are all here together.\" Beyonc\u00e9 opened memorial service for Kobe and Gianna Bryant by singing \"XO\" \u2014 one of his favorite songs. \"I'm here because I love Kobe,\u00a0and this is one of his favorite\u00a0songs.\u00a0So I want to start that over,\u00a0but I want us to do it all together, and I want you to sing\u00a0it so loud that he hears your\u00a0love.\u00a0Are you all ready?\u00a0Love you,\" she told those in attendance. ##Kobe## A memorial service for Kobe and Gianna Bryant has now started at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Beyonc\u00e9 opened the service by singing Kobe's favorite song, \"XO.\" Before the service started, photos and videos of Kobe and Gianna were shown on the scoreboard. Then Vanessa Bryant and her family walked in to standing applause. The scene outside the Staples Center this morning buzzed with fans, vendors, and a heavy police presence. Fans, many in a purple or gold Kobe Bryant jerseys, lined up along Figueroa Street to honor the late basketball legend.\u00a0\u00a0 Brothers Anthony and Edward Mercado woke at 5 a.m. and arrived\u00a0hours early to pay respect to their \"icon\" and \"hero\" whom they say they have idolized since they were children.\u00a0\u00a0 \"As a kid, whatever it was, in the park playing basketball, you want to be Kobe, the greatest,\" Edward said, admitting he would probably cry once inside of Staples Center.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s a blessing to be here,\" Edward said. \"This is a part of history going down now and I'll talk to my sons about this moment. I got chills right now as we talk.\"\u00a0 Anthony said he was inspired by Bryant's\u00a0\u201cmamba mentality\" to be better.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Kobe always made sure he was great at anything he did and he inspired us,\" Anthony said. \"He inspired everybody around the world to be great at what you do and inspire other to do the same.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0##Kobe## The programs all attendees received at today's memorial concluded with a heartfelt quote from Kobe Bryant to his daughters. Here's what the program said: \u201cLastly to our daughters \u2026 You guys know that if you do the work, you work hard enough, dreams come true. You know that, we all know that. But hopefully what you get from tonight is that those times when you get up early and you work hard; those times when you stay up late and you work hard; those times when don\u2019t feel like working \u2013 you\u2019re too tired, you don\u2019t want to push yourself \u2013 but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That\u2019s the dream. It\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey. And if you guys can understand that, what you\u2019ll see happen is that you won\u2019t accomplish your dreams, your dreams won\u2019t come true, something greater will. And if you guys can understand that, then I\u2019m doing my job as a father.\u201d ##Gianna## The memorial service for Kobe and Gianna Bryant will start soon. Here's what it looks like inside the Staples Center in Los Angeles: Every guest who enters Staples Center for today's memorial will get a shirt of Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, a ticket, a small pin and a \u201cCelebration of Life\u201d booklet. Here's what it looks like: Fans heading to the Staples Center in Los Angeles are donning Kobe Bryant jerseys and shirts in honor of the NBA legend. One fan wrapped their car in decals honoring Bryant. Hours ahead of\u00a0Monday's memorial for Kobe Bryant,\u00a0the man who chronicled all 20 years of Bryant's NBA career in photographs recalled one moment in particular that captured athlete's famed competitive mindset. Andrew D. Bernstein, the Los Angeles Lakers team photographer, said a January 2010 picture of an injured, exhausted Bryant preparing for a game \"really sums up the\u00a0Mamba mentality\u00a0in one photo.\" The photo shows Bryant in the visitors' locker room ahead of a game against the Knicks in New York's Madison Square Garden. A few things to know: Bryant had just played the night before, scoring\u00a031 points\u00a0in a 87-93 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. His body was far from its best \u2014 he had a broken finger. But nevertheless he was gearing up to play at MSG, one of basketball's grandest stages, and the Lakers \u2014 the league's defending champions \u2014 were in a tight race for the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. Bryant sits on a bench, his eyes closed, his feet soaking in an ice bucket, his head resting on his palm, his elbow pressing onto his knee. Bryant ended up playing 42 minutes, and led the Lakers in scoring with\u00a027 points\u00a0in a 115-105 win. The Lakers would go on to\u00a0win the NBA title\u00a0that year, defeating the Boston Celtics in seven games. It was Bryant's fifth and final NBA championship. Bernstein's photos appear in Bryant\u00a02018 book, \"The Mamba Mentality: How I Play.\" Lee Zeidman, President of the Staples Center, Microsoft Theater and LA Live said today's memorial will be, \"a very emotional celebration of life for Kobe, Gianna, and the 7 others who lost their lives.\" Zeidman encourages those with tickets to show up early and those without tickets to please stay away.\u00a0They are working on seating arrangements to make sure the celebration flows seamlessly for the families and the city of Los Angeles.\u00a0 Zeidman says the direction of today's memorial has been based on the wishes of Vanessa Bryant and the Lakers. \"I can tell you, as a venue operator, for 35 years, I was at the Forum, now the Staples Center, I have never seen more roses in my entire life in there. There are about 35,000 roses that are surrounding the center stage. And we did a center stage to maximize the amount of people we could put in the building,\" said Zeidman. He says, \"We do need you to stay at home and watch this,\" for ingress and egress of guests with tickets.\u00a0 Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna were laid to rest in a private ceremony in Corona Del Mar, California on Feb. 7, but now fans across the globe can honor the basketball star and his daughter via livestream.  The celebration of life will be held at the Staples Center on today Los Angeles and will be available on TIDAL, the streaming platform, today. TIDAL tweeted the announcement, confirming that non-subscribers will also be able to watch.  \u201cWe\u2019re honored to bring the Celebration of Life for Kobe and Gianna Bryant to fans across the globe via livestream,\u201d TIDAL said in the tweet. \u201cMembers, as well as non-members, are welcome to tune in on Monday, Feb. 24 at 10AM PT / 1PM ET.\u201d Anthony Mercado and his brother Edward got up at 5 a.m. to drive to the memorial Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.\u00a0\u00a0 Edward said he expects the tears to flow when the memorial begins at 10 a.m. local time. Kobe Bryant and his his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were among the nine people who died in a California helicopter crash last month. Here's what we know about the crash: What happened: A helicopter carrying nine people\u00a0crashed into a hillside\u00a0in Calabasas, California, on Jan. 26. The aircraft headed to Thousand Oaks for a basketball game, where Gianna was expected to play and Bryant was expected to coach.\u00a0\nThe victims: The other victims were Gianna's teammates\u00a0Alyssa Altobelli\u00a0and\u00a0Payton Chester;\u00a0Alyssa's parents,\u00a0John and Keri; Payton's mother, Sarah; assistant girls basketball coach\u00a0Christina Mauser; and\u00a0helicopter pilot Ara Zobayan.\nWe're still not sure what caused it: Federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the crash.\nIt was a foggy day: Minutes before the crash, their pilot\u00a0was trying to get special permission\u00a0to fly though foggy conditions. Seconds before the crash, the pilot told air traffic control he was\u00a0trying to avoid a cloud layer.  Kobe Bryant\u2019s widow, Vanessa Bryant, will attend the memorial at Staples Center today, according to a source close to the Lakers and the Bryant Family.\u00a0 The basketball star and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were buried privately earlier this month at a Southern California cemetery following their deaths\u00a0Jan. 26 in a helicopter crash. In a recent Instagram post, Vanessa said that she is struggling to process the sudden loss of both her husband and daughter.\u00a0 \"I've been reluctant to put my feelings into words,\" Bryant said in her post. \"My brain refuses to accept that both Kobe and Gigi are gone. I can't process both at the same time. It's like I'm trying to process Kobe being gone but my body refuses to accept my Gigi will never come back to me.\" Today the public will celebrate the lives of NBA legend Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. But the two were privately mourned earlier this month.  The Bryants were were buried on Feb. 7 at a Southern California cemetery following their deaths\u00a0in a Jan. 26 helicopter crash, death certificates released by Los Angeles County officials showed. Their resting place is Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona Del Mar, California, the documents stated. The cemetery is about two miles from the Pacific Ocean and less than a 10-minute drive from the family's church, Our Lady Queen of Angels, in Newport Beach. No details about a possible graveside service were released. The Bryants are Catholic, and\u00a0Kobe Bryant stopped by the parish's chapel\u00a0just hours before the fatal crash. The death certificates list Bryant as an \"author, producer, and athlete\" and his daughter as a \"coach and student.\""], "Language": false}
