The Toronto-based DJ and producer weaves First Nations sounds with techno and house music to create what he calls \u201cpow wow techno.\u201d He is a dancer, too, performing in full traditional regalia, a whirl of colorful beadwork and feathers. Director Chrisann Hessing captures the essence of this vibrant, creative performer in \u201cTurning Tables.\u201d \n\n\nHessing hopes people will be inspired by the short documentary\u2019s positive representation of an indigenous person thriving in today\u2019s world. It\u2019s a picture we don\u2019t see enough of, according to the director. \u201cThe film is already two years old, and I\u2019m happy to say that since then, there has been a lot more of this whole movement toward positive representation of minorities and people of color in media. But when I made the film, Josh didn\u2019t really see people like him onscreen and neither did I as a woman of color,\u201d says Hessing, who is also based in Toronto.\n\n\nHessing first met DePerry in 2015 when she was part of a crew making a dance film called \u201cI Lost My Talk\u201d for the National Art Center in Ottawa. DePerry was one of the dancers, and they kept in touch. A couple of years later, Hessing was looking for a documentary subject for a film of her own. Following the advice of a friend who once told her, \u201cYour next documentary subject is closer than you might think,\u201d she started looking over her Facebook friends list to see what kinds of cool things people were up to, and she reconnected with DePerry. \n\n\nThey met for coffee, and DePerry told her about his passion for pow wow techno. Unfamiliar with the genre, Hessing went to see DePerry perform with DJ Shub, a Mohawk DJ and producer and former member of A Tribe Called Red. \u201cIt was really that show, that performance, seeing him live that sealed the deal for me,\u201d Hessing says. \u201cWhen he came out in his regalia in this underground club, it was just electric.\u201d Hessing brought on producer Tanya Hoshi and production of the film began soon after.\n\n\nPart biopic, part creative celebration, \u201cTurning Tables\u201d is rich in music and dance. \u201cI really wanted to make sure that every scene involved music in some way,\u201d Hessing says.\n\n\nAt one point, Hessing follows DePerry home to Thunder Bay, Ontario. He was born and raised in the Anishinaabe community on the Long Lake 58 First Nation reservation. \u201cIn Toronto, he\u2019s a hustling music artist who is trying to make it in the big city. But in Thunder Bay, he\u2019s that guy that everyone knows and respects. That kind of stuck with me\u2014this element of duality, where you come from versus where you\u2019re going,\u201d Hessing says.\n\n\nHessing released \u201cTurning Tables\u201d in 2018. But that wasn\u2019t the end of the project. She and DePerry collaborated on a music video for the song \u201cStart the Fire ft. Natasha Fisher & Nimkii,\u201d returning to communities where they shot \u201cTurning Tables\u201d to capture footage. They also launched the Turning Tables Tour, bringing arts workshops to indigenous communities throughout Canada.\n\n\nWhen we\u2019re not making films, we\u2019re watching them.
