The former Vice President picked up primary wins in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, padding a significant delegate lead over fellow presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. In a victory speech from his home in Delaware, Biden showed interest in uniting Democratic voters, telling Sanders voters he and the Vermont senator had different tactics\u00a0but common goals on major issues like\u00a0health care, income inequality and climate change. Speaking from his home in Vermont, Sanders largely ignored the night's results, and urged supporters to focus on the economic crisis looming over the country in the shadow of the coronavirus threat. It was no surprise that Biden walked away with the full hand. Polls had him leading in all three voting states, and a recent CNN poll found a majority of voters in yesterday's primary states\u00a0would trust Biden in a crisis over Sanders.\u00a0 2. Coronavirus\u00a0 The White House is mulling various forms of economic aid to alleviate the damage done by ever-increasing coronavirus fears and restrictions. A $1 trillion economic stimulus negotiation is currently underway\u00a0on Capitol Hill. While President Trump has advocated for a payroll tax cut to stimulate the economy, he said yesterday he is also interested in sending out stimulus checks to all Americans, Great Recession-style. The administration is also pushing to further tighten immigration restrictions, including rejecting all asylum seekers. While these moves would allegedly be a response to the coronavirus threat, they also accomplish\u00a0hardline immigration goals held by some White House officials. Meanwhile, cancellations and crackdowns are mounting. The European Union has agreed to temporarily shut its exterior borders to non-essential travel, and the US and Canada are preparing to suspend\u00a0non-essential travel between the two countries. There are now more than 6,000 coronavirus cases in the US, and 197,000 worldwide. Follow along here for the latest.\u00a0 3. China\u00a0 China has announced it will expel journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal\u00a0in a major escalation\u00a0of\u00a0tensions with the US government. The move follows\u00a0America's recent decision to designate\u00a0five Chinese state media outlets as \"foreign mission\" outlets\u00a0and cap\u00a0the number of Chinese journalists working for those outlets on US\u00a0soil. The Chinese government also said the newly-banned journalists will not be allowed to operate in\u00a0the semi-autonomous cities of Macao or Hong Kong, which is typically where journalists blocked by Beijing would go to continue their work. 4. White House\u00a0 Dale Cabaniss, the head of Trump's\u00a0Office of Personnel Management, resigned abruptly yesterday amid reports of frustration within the OPM regarding coronavirus plans. According to sources within the department, there has been friction between the OPM and the White House regarding\u00a0government workflow and messaging to government employees amid coronavirus-related arrangements, and some within the OPM have felt\u00a0sidelined by the Office of Management and Budget. However, Cabaniss' resignation reportedly came as a complete surprise. 5. Manchester\u00a0 Hashem Abedi, the\u00a0brother of Manchester bomber\u00a0Salman Abedi, has been found guilty of the murders of\u00a022 people killed in the\u00a0suicide bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in 2017. Although Salman Abedi ultimately detonated the bomb, Hashem Abedi helped acquire the chemicals to make it, and encouraged and assisted his brother in planning the atrocity. England's Director of Public Prosecutions said Abedi \"has blood on his hands, even if he didn't detonate the bomb.\" The father of one of the bombing victims gave a statement after the verdict, saying the decision helped give a sense of justice to the hundreds of people affected by the attack.
