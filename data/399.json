Follow here for April 21, 2020 stock market news. US stocks finished lower on Monday, amid a historic selloff in the oil market. US oil futures settled in negative territory for the first time in history as demand for the commodity remains thin and storage capacity in the US is at its limit. The May futures contract is also about to expire, which made trading more erratic. The Dow closed 2.4%, or 592 points, lower. It was the worst day for the index since April 1.\nThe S&P 500 finished down 1.8%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite closed 1% lower. The stunning drop in oil prices Monday -- plummeting into negative territory -- may turn out to be a short-term anomalous quirk. But investors are betting tanker companies who might be asked by energy firms to store excess oil offshore could get a big boost.  Shares of oil tanker company Frontline (FRO) surged nearly 15%, while Teekay (TK), Scorpio Tankers (STNG) and Nordic American Tankers (NAT) soared around 20%. It's a byproduct of the quirk that led oil prices to plunge below $0.  The bet is that big oil producers, suddenly faced with a humongous drop in demand for crude as a result of the global Covid-19 pandemic, may need to find a way to store excess oil. The likely winners are companies like Frontline, which operate massive supertankers.  It's worth noting, though, that any uptick in demand for offshore oil storage could be temporary if prices rebound. And the longer-term fundamentals for oil tankers remain weak in light of the sudden plunge in the global economy. The tanker stocks are still down sharply this year despite Monday's big spike. US oil prices turned negative Monday for the first time ever as the great oil crash of 2020 took a bizarre turn. Crude finished at -$37.63 a barrel, marking the only time it has gone below zero since oil futures began trading on NYMEX in 1983.  The historic collapse shows just how terribly oversupplied the oil market has become. There are real fears that the world will soon run out of places to store barrels.  Producers are essentially PAYING to get rid of their barrels.  Part of the reason oil was so volatile is that trading volume was very light in the May contract, which expires Tuesday. That low liquidity set the stage for the unusual scenario of negative prices.  Although the May contract turned negative, the June contract was still trading above $20 a barrel. Brent crude, the world benchmark, traded above $25.  Crude finished at $18.27 a barrel on Friday, meaning they collapsed by more than 200% in one day.  Oil is so cheap that producers are paying to stockpilers to take barrels off their hands. US crude crashed on Monday, falling below $0 to $-1.43 -- the weakest level since NYMEX opened oil futures trading in 1983. That marks a stunning one-day decline from Friday's close of $18.27 a barrel.  The historic collapse shows that the market is betting the OPEC+ production cuts announced earlier this month aren't enough to offset the unprecedented in demand caused by the pandemic.  Part of Monday's nosedive is being driven by the fact that the May futures contract expires Tuesday, amplifying fears over a lack of storage space.  The June contract isn't selling off by nearly as much, losing only 12.2% to $21.97 a barrel.  The three main US stock benchmarks are all in the red in the early afternoon. The Nasdaq Composite briefly turned positive earlier in the session but since pared its gains again. Stocks are dragged lower by a collapse in oil prices. US oil fell to a low of just over $4 a barrel for May delivery. The selloff is being driven by the contract rolling off tomorrow and concerns over storage limits of physical oil. The Dow was last down 1.2%, or some 300 points, while the S&P 500 was 0.8% lower. The Nasdaq was down 0.1%. JBS USA, a major meat processor, is indefinitely closing its pork production facility in Worthington, Minnesota, the company said Monday.  \"We don\u2019t make this decision lightly,\u201d Bob Krebs, President of JBS USA Pork, said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize JBS Worthington is critical to local hog producers, the US food supply and the many businesses that support the facility each and every day.\u201d The Worthington facility processes more than 20,000 hogs each day, and employs more than 2,000 people. Over the next few days, a smaller staff will keep the plant running to move inventory through the system.  JBS USA has closed two plants prior to this one. One, in Souderton, Pennsylvania, reopened on Monday. Another, in Greeley, Colorado, is still closed.  The retail industry is in the midst of unprecedented turmoil. But the Covid-19 pandemic is also leading to opportunities for a select group of strong retailers to grow even more dominant -- thanks in large part to success in the realm of digital shopping.  Walmart (WMT), which owns Jet.com and several other niche e-commerce sites in addition to its own thriving Walmart.com platform, hit a new all-time high on Monday. The stock is now up 11% this year. Shares of Walmart rival Amazon (AMZN) were up more than 2% as well. The stock hit an all-time high last week and has surged more than 30% so far in 2020. Canadian online retailer Shopify (SHOP) also continues to surge. The stock rose 6% Monday to a new record. Chief technology officer Jean-Michel Lemieux said in a tweet last Thursday that \"our platform is now handling Black Friday level traffic every day!\" Shares have soared nearly 60% this year. Chinese e-commerce stocks are on fire as well. Pinduoduo (PDD), which lets people buy goods in groups in order to get big discounts, soared 11% Monday to a new record after it announced it was making an investment in Chinese household appliance and electronics retailer GOME.  Online retail leaders Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) have also bounced back sharply in recent weeks due to hopes that the worst could soon be over for China's economy. The Nasdaq Composite turned green mid-morning, having opened more than 1% lower just an hour and a half ago. The tech-heavy index was up 0.1%. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Dow sunk by 1%, or 245 points. Health care and consumer stocks are helping push the Nasdaq higher. Oil prices are plummeting, and they're taking commodity currencies down with them. US oil prices fell Monday to a low of $10.77 a barrel -- a level not seen since December 1998 -- as the May crude contract is set to expire, and suppliers are running out of places to store barrels. Currencies of oil-exporting countries like Canada, Norway and Russia are all getting hit. The US dollar climbed 0.4% against its Canadian rival, to C$1.41, and it gained 0.5% against the Norwegian krone to 10.36 krone per dollar. Versus the Russian ruble, the dollar climbed 0.8% to 74.44 ruble. The Brazilian real and Mexican peso, both also considered commodity-driven currencies, are feeling the pain as well. The greenback strengthened more than 1% against each of them. The oil market is in meltdown mode. US crude crashed an insane 41% on Monday to as low as $10.77 a barrel \u2013 the weakest level since December 1998. The latest collapse leaves oil down 83% since the January peak of $63.27 a barrel.\u00a0\u00a0 Monday's\u00a0nosedive was driven\u00a0by two major forces: the expiration of the\u00a0oil\u00a0futures contract and the\u00a0rapidly vanishing\u00a0space to store unneeded barrels of oil.\u00a0Although the May contract crashed below $11\u00a0on low volume,\u00a0the June contract traded above $22.\u00a0 That\u00a0unbelievably large spread is because of the storage\u00a0problem. Companies will need to pile up barrels in more expensive places like ships. The wider the spread, the more economical these\u00a0storage\u00a0alternatives\u00a0would be.\u00a0\u00a0 The remaining 21 million barrels of storage at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub will likely be filled up in May -- causing \u201cpanic\u201d in the oil markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, wrote in an email.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil prices spiked above $28 a barrel on April 3 after President Donald Trump\u00a0talked up\u00a0massive production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Crude is now sitting 62% below those April 3 levels.\u00a0\u00a0 US stocks dropped sharply at Monday\u2019s open, as oil prices once again headed lower. US oil prices crashed below $11, dropping to its weakest level since December 1998 at its low point. Oil is selling off as the May crude contract is set to expire, and suppliers are running out of places to store barrels. Meanwhile, earnings season is roaring on, with companies pulling their forecasts amid the coronavirus uncertainty. The Dow dropped 1.9%, or 460 points, at the opening bell. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%. The Nasdaq Composite opened down 1.1%. The coronavirus crisis is going to leave a mark on the US economy in the years to come, economists predict. But just how bad will 2020 be for growth? The expectation is a deep recession in the first half of 2020, followed by a recovery later in the year \"that still leaves US GDP down 6%, Europe's down 8%, Japan's down 3% and China's up just 2%,\" Joseph Amato, president and CIO of Equities at investment firm Neuberger Berman, said in a note on Monday. The Neuberger model's base case, or most likely scenario, assumes that Covid-19 cases peak around May or June in the United States, with a gradual reopening of the economy in June or July. Even in our base case, we see the Federal Reserve holding short-term rates at zero at least through 2021, and central bank asset purchases in the trillions of dollars,\" Amato said, adding that the government's fiscal policy response will expand the country's deficits to World War II levels. Neuberger Berman also identified a best-case scenario, in which the recovery from the virus would leave the US economy to only shrink by 3%. The worst case, on the other hand, assumes a second wave of infections and longer lockdown, with US GDP ending 2020 down 10% or more. \"Given the overall uncertainty and wide range of outcomes, we think volatility could be elevated for a while,\" Amato said. The spectacular collapse in oil markets is showing no signs of easing, as the coronavirus crisis saps demand and producers run out of places to store all their excess barrels of crude. What's happening? US oil prices plunged more than 28% to nearly $13 per barrel on Monday, their lowest level since 1999. The selloff can be attributed in part to market mechanics. The May futures contract for West Texas International, the US benchmark, is about to expire. Most investors are already focusing on the June contract, thinning out trading volume and feeding volatility, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told me. The extreme pressure on the WTI contract for May highlights ongoing concerns about the supply and demand dynamics plaguing the oil market.  What about the OPEC+ deal? Saudi Arabia, Russia and other producers tried to prop up prices with a deal last week to slash production by 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June, the deepest cut ever negotiated. But that isn't expected to soak up the supply glut caused by evaporating demand for energy. Oil storage facilities are still at risk of overflowing, raising the chance that some oil producers in the United States and Canada could start paying customers to take crude off their hands, according to Staunovo. Investors are particularly worried about storage reaching capacity in Cushing, Oklahoma, the main US hub. The Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is receiving a much-needed cash infusion to help stay afloat while its restaurants remain closed to dine-in customers. Roark Capital is investing $200 million into the chain to help boost its liquidity while it continues to deal with the coronavirus crisis.  Cheesecake Factory CEO David Overton said the deal also \"solidifies our ability to manage the business for the long-term for all of our stakeholders once we emerge on the other side of this crisis.\" Last month, the company said it wasn't paying April rent. Shares soared as much as 10% in premarket trading. US futures are off today as global stocks struggle to find direction and oil crashes. But taking a step back, the stock market appears to be in recovery mode. See here: The S&P 500 has jumped three of the past four weeks after nosediving into the fastest bear market in history. The broader picture, of course, is complicated.  \"The confusing thing for markets at the moment is the huge dichotomy between what will possibly be one of the worst synchronized global economic slumps in history against what is undoubtedly the largest ever intervention,\" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid told clients Monday. Deutsche Bank noted last week that top central banks have expanded their balance sheets by $2.7 trillion, two thirds of which has come from the US Federal Reserve. But negative economic data could continue to cause problems for investors who are ready to get back into riskier assets, with uncertainty about how long lockdowns will last remaining a key issue. United Airlines gave an early look at first-quarter results Monday, and they're unsurprisingly terrible: The airline will report a $2.1 billion loss. Shares of United (UAL) fell 6% in premarket trading on the report. The company said its adjusted earnings won't be quite as bad: a loss of $1 billion excluding special items. But that's still far worse than the $378 million loss forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. And things are likely to be even worse going forward.  United's first-quarter revenue was down only 17%, as it saw a limited hit to traffic in January and much of February. But the company said last week that demand for air travel is now \"essentially zero.\" United cut its schedule by more than 50% in April, but it filled only a small percentage of those seats with paying customers. So, for May and June the airline cut its schedule by about 90% of its original plans. Still, United said it has\u00a0$6.3 billion of cash available, including $2 billion to draw on existing credit lines. The airline also last week that it would get $5 billion in federal grants and low interest loans -- and it could announce billions in additional federal loan support this week. The major American banks reported earnings last week. This week,\u00a0get ready to hear from Coca-Cola\u00a0(KO),\u00a0Netflix\u00a0(NFLX),\u00a0Delta\u00a0(DAL),\u00a0IBM\u00a0(IBM)\u00a0and\u00a0Intel\u00a0(INTC). First up is IBM, which is on deck Monday after US markets close. Fewer than 10% of S&P 500 companies have reported results for the January to March period to date. So far, they've \"generally disappointed relative to tepid expectations,\" according to David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs.  The investment bank calculates that 43% of companies have missed Wall Street's predictions, on pace for the highest rate since at least 1998. FactSet analyst John Butters predicts that S&P 500 earnings dropped 14.5% in the first quarter. That would mark the largest year-over-year decline for the index since the third quarter of 2009. Watch this space: Much of the attention will be on expectations for full-year earnings, as investors try to assess how the coronavirus pandemic will hit businesses over a longer period. But Kostin notes that most strategists have written off 2020 entirely and are already looking ahead to 2021. Shake Shack\u00a0(SHAK)\u00a0is returning a $10 million loan it received from the US government under an emergency program that was\u00a0touted as a way to help small businesses\u00a0pay workers and keep their operations running during the coronavirus crisis. The burger chain was awarded the loan as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The $349 billion stimulus package, overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA),\u00a0ran out of funding\u00a0last week. Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti and chairman Danny Meyer revealed their decision to give back the funding in an\u00a0open letter\u00a0Monday, saying that the NYSE-listed company no longer needs the money because they are \"fortunate to now have access to capital that others do not.\"  The company said in a filing Friday that it expects to be able to raise up to $75 million from investors by selling shares.

Here's where they stand at 6:15 am ET: Dow futures fell 400 points, or 1.6%\nS&P 500 futures slid 1.5%\nNasdaq Composite futures dropped 1% Stocks around the world were having a mixed day: Hong Kong's\u00a0Hang Seng Index\u00a0(HSI)\u00a0ended down 0.2%, while China's\u00a0Shanghai Composite\u00a0(SHCOMP)\u00a0closed 0.5% higher.  The People's Bank of China on Monday cut its one-year\u00a0Loan Prime Rate\u00a0by 20 basis points to 3.85%. The cut to the rate was widely expected after the central bank\u00a0cut another key lending rate\u00a0last week. London's\u00a0FTSE 100\u00a0(UKX)\u00a0and Germany's\u00a0DAX\u00a0(DAX)\u00a0opened narrowly higher, but France's\u00a0CAC 40\u00a0(CAC40)\u00a0was slightly negative. US oil prices crashed Monday to a 21-year low as the market continues to be roiled by an epic collapse in demand caused by the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. Global stocks are mixed as investors brace for more companies to reveal how much the crisis is costing them. US oil futures were last down nearly 22% at $14.29 a barrel, their worst levels since 1999. Monday's plunge comes after prices hit\u00a0an 18-year low\u00a0last week as markets realized that record output cuts agreed by OPEC, Russia and other producers aren't nearly enough to offset the loss in demand. \"It hasn't taken long for the market to recognize that the OPEC+ deal will not, in its present form, be enough to balance oil markets,\" wrote Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a research note. The May futures contract for West Texas International is about to expire,\u00a0and frantic last minute trading is\u00a0compounding concerns about how much oil the United States will be able to store as demand dries up, according to Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy. He said that is leading to these \"large price swings.\" Netflix is the king of streaming:\u00a0It had 167 million subscribers around the world\u00a0\u2014 before the entire world was forced inside because of the coronavirus outbreak. The company is set to report its earnings after the bell Tuesday, and investors are eager to learn how the pandemic has altered Netflix's business, viewership and subscriber count. Netflix's\u00a0(NFLX)\u00a0own subscriber forecast is roughly 174 million worldwide \u2014 growth of around 7 million from last quarter. Bernie McTernan, a senior analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, believes the company should blow that number out of the water thanks to a boost from people being stuck at home. \"It's no surprise that streaming is surging right now. This is an unprecedented opportunity for Netflix,\" McTernan told CNN Business. \"Everyone believes it will be a massive beat. The question is how massive will it be.\" As demand for streaming video grows, Wall Street investors are growing hopeful that Netflix will soon raise prices, McTernan said. But that could be a tough pill for many customers to swallow with so many people out of work. Read more here."], "Language": false}
