But the threat of spreading coronavirus has prompted the city's public transit system to take additional steps to its already altered scheduled to discourage people from using the public transportation system to go see them during peak bloom. Trains will be running on a 30-minute operating schedule, and buses will operate on a Sunday schedule, system officials announced in a Friday statement. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority also reminded riders two of its stations \u2014 Smithsonian and Arlington Cemetery \u2014 close to the Tidal Basin where much of the cherry blossoms bloom will remain closed. Of course, people continue to show up and look at the bloom, including somebody who broke one of the fragile trees, according to the National Park Service.

So that really makes us really have to look into that and understand that, and really, just having the knowledge of that helps us in the United States so we can be very specific in talking to the American people about who to protect and how to protect them,\u201d she said. Birx stressed the importance of underlying and pre-existing medical conditions when it comes to coronavirus infections. \u201cIn Italy, again, most of the individuals who succumb to this disease had three other prior existing medical conditions,\u201d she said. ##Health## Epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Department of Public Health are being deployed to Albany in southwest Georgia to investigate multiple cases in the area, the health department said in a statement.

The academy trains thousands of future officers and agents for 90 federal, state and local law enforcement\u00a0agencies around the country.\u00a0This means thousands of agents training to join DHS and other agencies, including Postal Inspection Service, ATF and others, are going home. It also poses a potential problem as agents and officers for those agencies retire and aren\u2019t replaced by new people who the agencies were counting on.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## US officials are looking into a number of options to increase hospital capacity and ease the strain on protective gear like gowns and masks,\u00a0Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. Hospitals may consider \"creating Covid wards,\" similar to what has happened abroad. They are\u00a0checking the availability of Veterans Affairs hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. \"Now that we asked people to give up elective surgeries, that opens up a large number of beds that are already fitted with ventilators that can be\u00a0utilized,\" Birx said. In addition to utilizing industrial N95 masks, Birx expressed interest in developing an option for people to \"self test\" for the virus.\u00a0 If that becomes a reality,\u00a0\"then we could really eliminate the amount of personal protective devices needed in the testing arena,\" she said. \"So we're looking at all of these things to be both sparing of our current supplies as well as finding new innovations to expand our supply.\" Watch: ##Health## Andy Cohen, a television producer and host of Bravo's \"Watch What Happens Live,\" announced in an Instagram post on Friday that he's tested positive for coronavirus. \"After a few days of self-quarantine, and not feeling great, I have tested positive for coronavirus,\" Cohen wrote. \"As much as I felt like I could push through whatever I was feeling to do\u00a0#WWHL\u00a0from home, we\u2019re putting a pin in that for now so I can focus on getting better.\u00a0\u00a0I want to thank all the medical professionals who are working tirelessly for all of us, and urge everybody to stay home and take care of themselves.\" In recent years, Cohen has also served as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper.

On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that \"tens of thousands of tests are being performed every day.\" On Friday, President Trump said, \"We have now a great system. And it's almost fully in gear, but it's able to test millions of people.\" Currently, testing occurs through a variety of channels, including public\u00a0health\u00a0labs, hospitals and commercial labs. US\u00a0health\u00a0officials have said they\u00a0are working on\u00a0a system to share that data with\u00a0the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as required by law.

It was basically, \"Mr. President,\u00a0please reassure frightened\u00a0Americans.\"\nIndeed, Vice President Pence did\u00a0not have a problem handling\u00a0that question.\u00a0If  President Trump is not capable\u00a0of leading stably and\u00a0effectually, he should at least\u00a0for his own reputation, for the good of the country, stop\u00a0making things worse and consider\u00a0leaving the podium to others.\u00a0\nThe Hippocratic Oath: first do\u00a0not harm, that applies to\u00a0President Trump, too.\" Watch: New Orleans will join other major US cities and states as its residents have been told to stay home by the city's mayor.

The inmate's experiences this week describe how prisons could be a petri dish for the virus. James Davis, a 69-year-old serving a 10-year prison term for white collar fraud in Pennsylvania, asked on Tuesday to be released from prison because of the potential threat to his health.\u00a0 Davis highlighted for the appeals court how much he's in contact with more than 100 other inmates inside the federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, and how the prison has lacked providing cleaning products and soap. The court denied Davis' release on Friday, noting he could ask again if he tests positive for novel coronavirus. Davis' lawyer told the court that conditions in the federal prison, his age and history of asthma, heart problems, high blood pressure and other issues put him at \"severe risk of death from the coronavirus pandemic.\" In a court filing on Tuesday, Davis' team described the situation within the low-security prison which included inmates sitting together for meals and sharing a bathroom and common spaces. The filing also claimed inmates aren't given soap or cleaning products.  \"At two large town-hall-style gatherings with all 100+ inmates in the hall together, inmates were informed that the prison plans to make handsoap available in the restrooms in the future and, in the meantime, inmates were encouraged to use whatever soap they had available individually to wash their hands and wipe surfaces,\" Davis' lawyers wrote. \"During the town hall gathering, prison officials admitted that it was not an ideal situation because they were unable to comply with (since superseded) CDC guidance for avoiding groups of 50.\" Prosecutors countered that Davis shouldn't be released because he's not in any unique circumstance compared to others. They also explained to the court that \"the Bureau of Prisons is taking aggressive steps to mitigate risk from Covid-19.\" What we know: The Bureau of Prisons is screening new inmates for symptoms and may screen staff. Prisons have also barred visitors and limited the movements of inmates, prosecutors wrote.\u00a0 The Bureau of Prisons says it has no confirmed cases of the virus among inmates or staff, though a staff member in Texas is being tested and one in New Hampshire has a presumptive diagnosis based on flu-like symptoms. Davis has been in prison since May 2019. ##Health## The US Army is closing its recruiting stations across the country and shifting to virtual recruiting amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to basically virtual recruiting much of that is done on social media and that allows us to protect our soldiers and also protect the new recruits,\u201d the Chief of Staff of the Army Gen.

Trudeau called these \"exceptional measures\" as they try to deal with an influx of migrants who must be processed and quarantined when they enter the country from the United States. Trudeau said most of the asylum seekers are in the US legally. Asylum seekers are already returned to the US when they attempt to claim asylum at official border crossings in Canada under the Safe Third Country Agreement.\u00a0For more than three years, migrants have been using a loophole to that law which means it does not apply at unofficial border crossings.\u00a0 Canada also said the border with the US would close to all non-essential travel as of midnight Friday.\u00a0 \u201cThis decision will be implemented on March 21, 2020, at which time the U.S. and Canada will temporarily restrict all non-essential travel across the US-Canada land border.

Despite hospitals in Italy canceling elective surgeries and turning operating rooms into temporary intensive care units, the country has seen limited capacity in treating an influx of COVID-19 patients, Rosenbaum said. And doctors have had to ration care. Experts, including US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, have widely cautioned that the US could \"become Italy\" as the outbreak worsens stateside. ##Health## An Air Force service member and Air Force contractor who had been in the Pentagon within the last three weeks have tested positive for the coronavirus in what is believed to be the first cases involving Pentagon personnel. \u00a0\u201cAn active duty member who works for Defense Health Agency, Falls Church, Va. tested positive for Covid-19.

In Bridgewater\u2019s model, companies will have a shortfall of $2 trillion \u201cconcentrated in energy and travel and leisure, and about equally divided between large and small companies.\u201d The firm projects a\u00a06% decline in US GDP for 2020, with the biggest hit during the second quarter. The firm also estimates a decline of $12 trillion for global businesses in 2020. \u201cSince this hit to revenues is happening throughout the world, the total hole globally will be roughly three times that\u2014about $12 trillion. Governments are responding, of course, but in most cases these responses will just mitigate some of the ripple. Governments\u2019 capacities to deal with this hit vary greatly and will be a major driver of markets going forward,\" the report stated. \u201cMany companies will try to fill this gap by drawing credit lines, increasing their debt positions,\u201d said the investors. If government policies don\u2019t help fill the gap, companies are likely to dramatically cut spending, which would result in meaningful cuts in employment. Ray Dalio, who founded Bridgewater, is famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis. ##Business## The World Health Organization has distributed 1.5 million coronavirus lab tests around the world and they will need 80 to 100 times that, according to Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program. Speaking at a WHO briefing on Friday, Ryan said, \u201cIf we look forward in this epidemic, and we project ourselves forward a number of months, and the amount of testing that is going to be needed, we need to scale that up approximately 80 to 100 times.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSo, it\u2019s not about doubling the availability of lab tests, it\u2019s not about tripling it, it\u2019s about potentially increasing that 80-fold. Now that\u2019s an extreme analysis, but that\u2019s what we need to aim for,\u201d Ryan warned. Addressing the impact on health systems, Ryan said, \u201cLook at the intensive care units, completely overwhelmed, the doctors and nurses utterly exhausted. This is not normal.

On the medical supplies, he added: \"They'll be here soon and we'll\u00a0ship them directly to states.\" More context: Yesterday at the daily coronavirus task force news conference, Trump said, \"The governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work and they are doing a lot of this work\" to get medical supplies. He continued, \"The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and shipping. You know, we're not a shipping clerk.\" President Trump does not think a national lockdown order is needed as the US continues to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Trump's remarks Friday afternoon come after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said 100% of non-essential workers should stay home.  \"I don't think so,\" Trump said when asked about the need for a national lockdown. \"Essentially you've done that California and New York have\u00a0done that.\u00a0I don't think so. Because you go out to\u00a0the midwest and other locations\u00a0and they're watching their\u00a0television but they don't have\u00a0the same problems.\" Trump added: \"We are working with the governors and I don't think we'll ever\u00a0find it necessary.\" ##Daily Life## ##Health## Top US infectious disease doctor Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said he \"strongly\" supports the New York governor's decision to mandate that 100% of non-essential workers stay home in the state. Fauci, a New Yorker himself, added: \"I know what New Yorkers can do. We're tough.\" He called on all New Yorkers to cooperate with the mandate. More context: Earlier today, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a mandate requiring all non-essential workers to stay home in the state. The number of positive cases has surged to over 7,000 as the state has ramped up testing, the governor said. Deborah Birx, a physician and public health expert, spoke Friday about some of the \"concerning\" trends she is seeing across the globe during the coronavirus pandemic. Birx specifically discussed Italy, where the number of deaths related to coronavirus has surpassed China.  \"We continue to review the\u00a0data and we continue to see\u00a0signs that individuals under 20,\u00a019 and under, may have severe\u00a0disease but majority have all\u00a0recovered to date.\u00a0We still see the same trend and\u00a0frankly from Italy we are seeing\u00a0another concerning trend that the\u00a0mortality in males seems to\u00a0be twice in every age group of\u00a0females.\u00a0This should alert all of us to\u00a0continue our vigilance to\u00a0protect our Americans that are\u00a0in nursing homes,\" Birx said. More on Italy and China: The number of deaths in Italy reached 3,405 on Thursday, the Italian Civil Protection Agency said at a news conference \u2014 156 more than China's toll, which, according to Johns Hopkins University, stands at 3,249. The total number of cases in Italy rose to 41,035 with 5,322 new cases, officials added. The grim figure comes hours after China marked a major milestone in the battle to limit the spread, reporting no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the first time since the pandemic began. ##Health## President Trump said he kicked his usage of the Defense Production Act \"into gear\" on Thursday evening after saying he would only invoke the measure in a worst case scenario. Trump told reporters he'd moved the National Response Coordination Center \u2014 an office within the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u2014 into the \"highest level of activation.\" \"We are helping the states a lot,\" Trump said during the daily coronavirus briefing. More on this: There remains some confusion around Trump's use of the Defense Production Act, which he signed on Wednesday but later said he wasn't yet invoking despite shortages of medical gear and equipment. On Thursday, Trump said it was the responsibility of individual governors to ensure their states have sufficient levels of supplies. The DPA allows the federal government to direct industries to produce necessary equipment, but it remains unclear whether Trump has provided that direction yet. President Trump expressed support for measures taken by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Andrew Cuomo in California and New York, respectively, to address the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Trump said he\u2019s been watching what's happened in California, where Newsom issued a state-wide lock down.  On Friday, Cuomo announced that all workers in non-essential businesses across New York state are required to stay home in an effort to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI applaud them. They\u2019re taking very strong, bold steps and I applaud them,\u201d Trump said about the governors. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed reports that the US has worked with Mexico to \"restrict\u00a0non-essential travels across our\u00a0shared border,\" he said today during the Coronavirus Task Force White House briefing. Pompeo discussed the restriction of travel to Canada as well. \"President Trump announced on\u00a0Wednesday, the United States and\u00a0Canada jointly agreed to\u00a0restrict non essential traffic\u00a0across ourborders, it goes into\u00a0effect at midnight and excluding\u00a0crossing the border unless for\u00a0work or other essential reasons.\u00a0The United States and Mexico\u00a0have agreed to restrict\u00a0non-essential travels across our\u00a0shared border.\u00a0Both our countries know the\u00a0importance of working together\u00a0to limit the spread of the\u00a0virus,\" Pompeo said. Following Pence's remarks, Chad Wolf, acting Homeland Security secretary, said neither agreement with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce. \"We'll continue to maintain a\u00a0strong supply chain across our\u00a0border,\" Wolf said. The agreement between Mexico and Canada will go affect March 21. ##Travel## President Trump confirmed he spoke with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday. Trump had an \u201cextremely good\u201d call with Schumer \u201ca little while ago,\u201d he said at the Coronavirus Task Force White House briefing.\u00a0 A Schumer spokesperson passed along a readout of the call earlier today, saying that Schumer urged Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act.\u00a0 Trump did not confirm the Schumer readout of the call, which said he agreed to immediately invoke the Act. \u201cWe are working on various elements of the deal. The Democrats are very much wanting something to happen and I think it will,\u201d Trump said of a stimulus bill. Trump said he also spoke \u201cat length\u201d with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and there is a \u201ctremendous spirit to get something done.\u201d President Trump said at press conference today that the federal government  has\u00a0\"temporarily waived\u00a0all interest on federally held\u00a0student loans\" for 60 days due to the coronavirus outbreak. He added: \"If we need more, we'll extend that period of\u00a0time.\" Watch: According to CNN Health\u2019s tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through public health systems, there are\u00a015,599\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States.\u00a0 As of Friday morning, 197\u00a0people have died. The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his order for all non-essential workers to stay home is \"not a shelter in place order.\" Cuomo said \"words matter\" and pushed back on the suggestion that the new mandate is a shelter-in-place order. He said he's increasing the mandates \"because the numbers are increasing\" of positive cases. On the question of who counts as an essential worker, he noted that mass transit workers and restaurant staff doing delivery and take-out service can still go to work. ##Daily Life## Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for a moratorium on evictions for 90 days because \"I want\u00a0to protect the people of the\u00a0state of New York,\" he said Friday during a press conference. This order applies to both residential and commercial properties, Cuomo added. \"I understand that may affect\u00a0businesses negatively.\u00a0And I've spoke to a number\u00a0of them.\u00a0I don't know who you think\u00a0you're going to rent an\u00a0apartment to now anyway if you\u00a0kick someone out.\u00a0By my mandate, you couldn't even\u00a0have a real estate agent out\u00a0showing the apartment.\u00a0Same with the commercial\u00a0tenants. But I know that we're going to\u00a0put people out of work with what\u00a0I did.\u00a0I want to make sure I don't put\u00a0them out of their house,\" Cuomo said. ##Daily Life## ##Business## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today that the state now has 7,102 positive cases of coronavirus. New York has tested more than 32,000 people, Cuomo said. Cuomo noted that since the state is now doing more tests you're \"going to get more positive cases.\" He said the state has \"the testing so high that we're testing per capita more than China or South Korea.\" New York has done a \"great job ramping up\" testing, Cuomo said. He pointed out that 10,000 people were tested last night. \"In total we have tested 32,000\u00a0people.\u00a0We did 10,000 tests last night.\u00a0I had said last week we hope to\u00a0get to 6,000 tests.\u00a0We have gotten to 10,000 tests.\u00a0Which again, I'm very proud of\u00a0the operation.\u00a0But again, that's why you see\u00a0the number going up,\" Cuomo added. Watch:  All\u00a0workers in non-essential\u00a0businesses across New York state are required to stay home,\u00a0New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo just announced. He said there will be a civil fine and\u00a0mandatory closure for any\u00a0business \"that is not in\u00a0compliance.\"\u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo just announced that 100% of non-essential workers must stay home.  This comes only a day after California's governor took similar measure, locking down the entire state of nearly 40 million. These two states taking these measure means that one in five Americans now must sequester themselves due to the outbreak.  ##Health## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo laid out a series of rules all New Yorkers in the most vulnerable groups should follow in order to protect themselves from coronavirus. This group includes seniors, those with compromised immune\u00a0systems and people with underlying\u00a0illnesses.\u00a0 Here are the rules: Remain indoors\nCan go outside for solitary exercise\nPre-screen all visitors and aides by taking their temperature\nDo not visit households with multiple people\nAll vulnerable persons should wear a mask when in he company of others\nTo the greatest extent possible, everyone in the presence of vulnerable people should wear a mask\nAlways stay at least six feet away from individuals\nDo not take public transportation unless urgent and absolutely necessary ##Daily Life## ##Health## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo just announced that 100% of non-essential workers should stay home. Only essential businesses will be functioning.  Cuomo is calling it \"New York state on pause.\" \"We need everyone to be safe, otherwise no one can be safe,\" Cuomo said. \"This is the most drastic action we can take,\" Cuomo said. Watch: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the state is in dire need of ventilators to battle coronavirus, calling ventilators \"the key piece of equipment.\" \"If you are a regulated health\u00a0facility, we are asking you by\u00a0order of the Department of\u00a0Health to make that ventilator\u00a0available.\u00a0We will purchase it from you.\u00a0You could lend it to us. But we need ventilators,\" Cuomo said. He said that anyone in possession of ventilators that can be sold or loaned to New York should contact the state Department of Health. \"We need those ventilators.\u00a0The ventilators are to this war\u00a0what missiles were to World War\u00a0II.\" ##Health## Gov. Andrew Cuomo is calling on retired medical professionals and medical school students to help with the growing number of infected people visiting New York hospitals. Cuomo said this personnel is necessary because hospitals have been instructed to operate at \"maximum capacity.\" \"We want to know from each\u00a0hospital how many beds can you\u00a0get in your hospital.\u00a0We're waiving the department of\u00a0health and DFS regulations about\u00a0space, et cetera.\u00a0This would be for short-term\u00a0emergency basis, but we want to\u00a0plan from every hospital, if you\u00a0use every available space how\u00a0many beds can you get in the\u00a0hospital.\u00a0And we started that a few weeks\u00a0ago, but that is now coming to a\u00a0critical point.\u00a0With more beds, you need more\u00a0staff.\u00a0So we're going to nursing\u00a0schools, medical schools, asking\u00a0retired doctors and nurses to\u00a0come back into service,\" Cuomo said. ##Health## Gov. Andrew Cuomo said manufacturers of masks, ventilators and other medical protective equipment should contact his office, and he will pay a premi \"If you are a business that\u00a0doesn't manufacture these exact\u00a0items, but if you have equipment\u00a0and personnel and you believe\u00a0that you could manufacture these\u00a0items. They're not complicated,\u00a0a mask is not a complicated item\u00a0to make. A PPE gown is not a\u00a0complicated item. Gloves,\u00a0nitrile gloves are not a\u00a0complicated item.\u00a0If you will make them, we will\u00a0give you funding to do it,\" Cuomo said. d. More context: Earlier today, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said on CNN that New York City will run out of medical supplies in 2 to 3 weeks.  Ventilators are the greatest need, according to Cuomo.  During the current coronavirus pandemic, it is \"more important than ever\" for heart attack and stroke survivors to reduce the risk of another event and \"avoid busy hospitals,\" the American Heart Association said in a statement Friday. \"Based on current information, it appears elderly people with coronary heart disease or hypertension are more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms. Stroke survivors may face increased risk for complications if they get Covid-19,\" the statement said. The AHA noted that after a heart attack or stroke, as many as 1 in 4 survivors will have another one. To prevent a heart attack or stroke, the AHA offered these tips: Take your medications as prescribed\nManage your risk factors by quitting smoking, eating healthy, staying active\nKeep any follow-up appointments with your doctor and see if virtual visits are possible\nParticipate in a cardiac rehab program virtually\nGet support from loved ones as needed when you feel overwhelmed, scared or confused ##Daily Life## ##Health## Organizers of the Scripps National Spelling Bee have suspended the annual event due to the on-going coronavirus threat.  The competition that pits over 500 spellers, all of whom are 15 years-old or younger but have not passed eighth grade, was set to start on May 24 in Oxon Hill, Maryland, just outside Washington, DC. Scripps said in statement it would attempt to reschedule the 93rd competition later this year. What happened last year: The competition featured an epic ending with eight co-champions.

Marriott's furloughs,\u00a0which previously were only for its hotel workers, are now hitting the corporate level. The world's largest hotel chain confirmed to CNN Business that it's moving to shortened work weeks at its corporate headquarters and it's putting many of its employees on temporary leaves that could last as long as three months.\u00a0 The changes will \"impact most associates\" at the Bethesda, Maryland-based company, a spokesperson said. Marriott shares are up 22% in early trading because of hopes of a stimulus package from the US government. ##Business## Miguel Patricio, CEO of Kraft Heinz, told CNN moments ago that his company is addressing price gouging by trying to keep grocery store shelves stocked. \"We are finding solutions to\u00a0increase productivity so we can\u00a0keep or avoid the shelves being empty.\u00a0I'll give you an example.\u00a0We stopped producing some of the\u00a0SKUs to concentrate on products\u00a0that have high rotation so we\u00a0can increase the productivity of\u00a0our plants to do that.\u00a0Of course we communicate daily\u00a0with our customers and grocery companies,\" Patricio told CNN. What other companies are doing to address this: Amazon has removed more than 530,000 listings from its marketplace and suspended 2,500 US sellers for coronavirus-related price gouging, the company told a US senator on March 6. The company is also working with state attorneys general to prosecute \u201cthe worst offenders,\u201d it told Sen. Ed Markey in a letter. The disclosure comes as demand spikes\u00a0\u2014 both online and off \u2014 for supplies including face masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning products. CVS and Walgreens\u00a0have warned\u00a0of possible shortages. In its letter, Amazon said it is using a mix of \"automated and manual methods\u201d to identify cases of price gouging.\u00a0 Watch: ##Business## ##Daily Life## The Trump administration is expected to announce details Friday on plans to halt\u00a0non-essential travel on the US-Mexico border in an effort to limit travel amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0according to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. \u201cWe\u2019re working with both our Canadian partners as well as our Mexican partners, limiting nonessential travel across that border,\u201d Wolf told reporters Friday. \u201cWe want to make sure cargo continues, trade continues, healthcare workers continue to be able to traverse that border. But tourism, some recreational activities need to stop during this crisis.\u201d Wolf told reporters that more details on a southern border\u00a0non-essential\u00a0closure will be announced later Friday.\u00a0 The expected action on the southern border appears similar to the one taken on the US border with Canada and marks the latest move by the administration to seal off the United States as coronavirus continues to spread.\u00a0 Some context: Over recent weeks, Trump has joined countries across the globe in introducing a slate of travel restrictions, which extend from China to\u00a0Europe's Schengen Area to the United Kingdom and Ireland, over coronavirus concerns.  In a span of a few days, Trump has also moved to largely shutter the US land borders.\u00a0 \u00a0##Travel## The Volkswagen Group will donate almost 200,000 respiratory masks for public health care in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the company said in a statement Friday. \"People working in the public health sector are currently performing outstanding services to society,\" Volkswagen HR Board Member Gunnar Kilian said, according to the statement. \"We are convinced that these face masks will be put to the best use by them.\" The group said\u00a0it will provide FFP-2 and FFP-3 respiratory masks.  \"The donation is being made in close cooperation with the Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn,\" according to the statement. \"The city of Wolfsburg will also be supported with medical material.\"\u00a0 Kilian added: \"Solidarity takes priority for Volkswagen. This principle also applies beyond the factory gate.\" ##Business## ##Health## Restrictions on social contact in the United Kingdom will need to be in place for \u201cat least most of a year\u201d to ensure the coronavirus outbreak is kept under control, the government\u2019s scientific advisers have said. The strict measures on \u201csocial distancing,\u201d such as advising people not to socialize in restaurants, closing schools and keeping vulnerable groups at home, will only be effective if used all together and for a prolonged period, they said. Otherwise, at the peak of the outbreak, the UK\u2019s public health service would be overwhelmed. The conclusions are contained in a set of papers from Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), which provides scientific and technical advice to government decision makers during emergencies, published by the government on Friday. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this week that coronavirus could be beaten within 12 weeks,\u00a0the documents suggested the effort would last considerably longer. Some more background: In a document dated March 16, the advisers said that isolation and the social distancing of vulnerable groups alone were \u201cvery unlikely to prevent critical care facilities being overwhelmed.\" If the government added school closures and wider social distancing, that \u201cwould be likely to control the epidemic when kept in place for a long period\u201d and should be implemented \u201cas soon as practical.\u201d It said that authorities could alternate between strict and more relaxed social distancing measures. But in total, restrictions would need to be in place for at least a year, with the stricter measures enacted for at least six months. The government has been criticized for not making its advice mandatory \u2014 particularly in London, where the spread of the virus is more advanced than in the rest of the UK. ##Daily Life## DC Fire & EMS tweeted that there are 141 Washington, DC, firefighters and 70 police officers in quarantine due to the novel coronavirus.

Trump asked\u00a0Hassett, a CNN commentator, to rejoin the administration just as the economic outlook has\u00a0darkened significantly\u00a0in recent days. Hassett told CNN on Thursday the widespread shutdowns caused by the health crisis could spark a\u00a0repeat of the Great Depression.\u00a0 \"We're going to have to either have a Great Depression, or figure out a way to send people back to work even though that's risky,\" Hassett said. \"Because at some point, we can't not have an economy, right?\" Some background: Hassett\u00a0left\u00a0the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0in June 2019 after nearly two years as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\u00a0 During his second stint in the\u00a0White House,\u00a0Hassett\u00a0is expected to\u00a0advise the President on economic\u00a0matters and have an office in the West Wing.\u00a0 US stocks kicked the day off in the green on Friday, adding onto the prior session\u2019s gains.

The president of the International Olympic Committee has said the games will not be canceled but added that the games may possibly be postponed.  Games in question: Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) board member Kaori Yamaguchi  is calling for the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed because athletes are unable to prepare adequately, she told the Nikkei newspaper. Yamaguchi, who won a Judo bronze medal at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, said she plans to raise this point at a JOC Board Meeting scheduled for March 27. \"The Olympics should not be held in a situation people in the world can\u2019t enjoy,\" Yamaguchi said. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## Newly unemployed Americans are racing to file for jobless benefits as the coronavirus pandemic forces many businesses to reduce staff or shutter their doors, at least temporarily. The swift, steep jump after years of low unemployment has strained some states' ability to keep up, forcing them to add representatives to their call centers, extend hours and bolster their online capacity as they await a $1 billion infusion approved by Congress. The crush also comes as some states have temporarily expanded eligibility and waived one-week waiting periods so people affected by the pandemic can tap into unemployment benefits more quickly. Around the country: In Illinois, the Department of Employment Security has been deluged in the last couple of days as more residents file for claims amid coronavirus emergency orders \u2014 such as Gov. J.B. Pritzker's mandate closing restaurants and bars except for delivery. Between Monday and Wednesday, the agency received over 64,000 unemployment benefit claims, more than ten times the 6,074 claims filed during the same time period in 2019. New York State's Department of Labor website is currently averaging 250,000 logins per day \u2014 a 400% increase over the normal average, according to Deanna Cohen, a department spokeswoman. The hotline is also ringing off the hook, with more than 75,000 calls a day, compared to an average of 10,000 calls normally. By noon on Thursday, the department website had 206,080 logins and 159,000 calls. To handle the onslaught in Ohio, the state Department of Job and Family Services has extended its call center's weekday hours and added availability on Saturdays to answer questions and process claims from those who can't file online. New filings skyrocketed from 3,900 the first four days of last week to 111,000 the same period this week, according the agency. ##Daily Life## ##Business## The US-led training effort aimed at combating ISIS has been suspended due to COVID-19, according to a defense official.\u00a0 \u201cTo prevent potential spread of COVID-19, Iraqi Security Forces and coalition forces have stopped all training. That has led to the repositioning of some training forces for force protection and operational continuity; some trainers will depart Iraq in the coming days and weeks,\u201d a US defense official told CNN. The official added that the US-led\u00a0coalition \u201cremains committed to the lasting defeat of ISIS and if the situation allows training will resume\u201c The coronavirus pandemic is impacting the US military in places like Iraq and Afghanistan as measures to prevent its spread have caused the US to limit its activities including operations to help counter ISIS. As the nation and the world self-quarantine in the midst of a pandemic, the Supreme Court justices will meet privately on Friday, either in person or telephonically, to discuss pending cases and presumably how they will handle the rest of a blockbuster term.\u00a0 The meeting is one of the regularly scheduled conferences the justices hold throughout the term, but it comes as the court has closed its doors to the public and taken other precautions as the country grapples with the coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 Earlier in the week, the court said that \"some justices\" may choose to \"participate remotely by telephone.\" That's because six of the justices are 65 and older. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are in their 80s \u2014 well within the government's standard for individuals at a higher risk. In the same press release, the court said that in order to abide by \"public health precautions,\" the court would postpone oral arguments for the next sitting, which was scheduled to begin March 23. The most important case from that sitting is President Trump's bid to shield his financial documents.\u00a0 Some historical context: The move to postpone is exceedingly rare, but there is precedent. In 1918, arguments were postponed in response to the Spanish flu epidemic. The calendar was shortened in 1793 and 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks. Barbershops, hair salons, tattoo or piercing parlors, nail salons, hair removal services, and \u201crelated personal care services\u201d will be closed to the public beginning Saturday 8 p.m. ET, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, along with the governors of New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, said in a statement regarding their four states. These businesses must be closed because \"these services cannot be provided while maintaining social distance,\u201d the governors said in the statement. As of 8 p.m. ET Thursday, indoor portions of retail shopping malls, amusement parks and bowling alleys in the four states were all shuttered across the four states, the statement said. \"We know how the novel coronavirus spreads, and we are making data-driven decisions as the situation evolves to continue to reduce density and slow the spread of the virus,\"\u00a0 Cuomo said.\u00a0\"We remain in constant communication with our neighboring states to ensure we are establishing a set of uniform rules and regulations for the entire region. These temporary closures are not going to be easy, but they are necessary to protecting the health and safety of New Yorkers and all Americans.\" ##Daily Life## Air Canada says the company is working with its unions to place employees on a temporary, off-duty status.  The employees would be reinstated when the airline can ramp up its schedule again, Air Canada said in a statement. It\u2019s not clear how many employees will be impacted. CNN Business has reached out to the Canadian Union of Public Employees for comment. ##Business## ##Travel## The US Food and Drug Administration said it is \"not aware of scientific evidence\" connecting the use of popular anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms.\u00a0 The FDA made this announcement following the publication of a letter last week in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine that hypothesized such non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could increase a certain enzyme in the body, which could aggravate COVID-19 symptoms. \"The agency is investigating this issue further and will communicate publicly when more information is available. However, all prescription NSAID labels warn that \u2018the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections,\u2019\" the FDA said. ##Health## ##Daily Life## The top infectious disease expert in the US, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told NBC's \"The Today Show\" he thinks Americans will have to stay home and continue to social distance for several more weeks. \u201cIf you look at the trajectory of the curves of outbreaks in other areas, it\u2019s at least going to be several weeks,\u201d Fauci said on Friday. \u201cI cannot see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from, it\u2019s going to be over. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a chance of that, I think it\u2019s going to be several weeks.\u201d Fauci also discussed the spread of the novel coronavirus with host Savannah Guthrie. He said the best thing the US can do right now is to delay any elective surgeries to keep hospital beds and equipment available. Guthrie asked if President Trump should invoke the Defense Production Act, and Fauci said the president \u201cis very serious about doing everything we could possibly do.\u201d They will meet today, Fauci said, and he is sure that would come up in their discussions. Guthrie asked if doctors going to the craft store to make their own medical equipment is considered the worst-case scenario. \u201cObviously we are in a very difficult situation and we should be doing everything we can to mitigate that,\u201d Fauci responded. Regarding the anti-malaria drug Trump said could treat COVID-19, Fauci said they have heard anecdotally that the drugs work, but they have not been tested in controlled trials. \u201cSo what we\u2019re saying is that we want to make them more available, but in the context of a protocol of some sort, that would not only make them available but that we can get some information as to whether they\u2019re safe and whether they really work,\u201d Fauci said. ##Health## Germany's worldwide\u00a0travel warning, which was announced last week due to the coronavirus pandemic, will apply until the end of April, the country's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas announced Friday. \u201cOur warning against tourist travel abroad is valid until the end of April for the time being. It therefore includes the Easter holidays,\u201d Maas wrote on Twitter. ##Travel## New York City needs 45 million surgical gowns, coveralls, gloves and face masks \u2013 known as personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013  in April to ensure its healthcare system\u00a0can deal with coronavirus-related issues,\u00a0Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio, told CNN Friday morning. This up from 25 million, as announced by de Blasio in a press conference late Thursday afternoon. \u201cWe increased our ask,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThings are constantly shifting and changing!\u201d ##Health## The United Kingdom's National Health Service\u00a0(NHS) has asked 65,000 nurses and doctors\u00a0who retired in the last three years\u00a0to return and help tackle the \u201cgreatest global health threat\u201d in a century. Medical personnel with up-to-date skills and experience, including retirees, will be surveyed on what type of role they could do.\u00a0Those who join the \u201cNHS army\u201d will be given a full induction and online training to help them to hit the ground running, said the NHS in a statement released Thursday. \u201cAs the health service gears up to deal with the greatest global health threat in its history, my message to former colleagues is \u2018Your NHS Needs You,\u2019\u201d said\u00a0Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England. Final-year medical students and student nurses are also being offered the chance to take temporary roles on full pay to boost frontline capacity even further, the agency said. Similar measures are being implemented in other European countries as thousands of medical students are being fast-tracked into early service in an attempt to boost\u00a0health systems\u00a0across the continent that are struggling to cope with the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak.

Russia has had a relatively low number of reported coronavirus cases, with 199 confirmed, according to the country\u2019s coronavirus response headquarters.\u00a0 Peskov downplayed reports in local media about shortages of masks and other equipment, saying there was enough protective equipment \"for those who work with patients ... serve the population ... take tests ... [and]  for those who meet passengers of aircraft and other vehicles arriving from dangerous countries.\u201d\u00a0 The Kremlin spokesperson added there was \u201cno need\u201d for Russian President Vladimir Putin to take a coronavirus test, as he was feeling healthy and has continued his work. \u201cWe are all in the same boat\u201d when it comes to efforts by Russian and international scientists to work toward developing a vaccine, Peskov added. Two negative tests \u2014 taken 24 hours apart \u2014 are currently needed to \u201cfeel safe in going out into society\u201d after being diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, but that may change as we learn more about the virus, according to an infectious disease expert. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained the possible shift during\u00a0a live-streamed conversation with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cIf you test positive, when is it OK to interact with others?\u201d said Zuckerberg, relaying a viewer\u2019s question. Fauci responded that \u201cstrictly speaking, if you are positive, you have the virus in you. And the way you determined positive was you got a nasal swab in your nasopharynx and you cultured the virus.\u201d The \u201cstrict guideline\u201d for going back out into society is two negative tests a day apart, Fauci said, to confirm that \u201cyou\u2019re not shedding virus anymore, so you can feel free to go out.\u201d But \u201cthat might change,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIt may be more flexible, when we get a better feel for what the real bracket of time [is] of people shedding\u201d the virus. ##Health## Deaths from Covid-19 in Spain hit 1,002 on Friday, an increase of 235 in the past day, according to a Spanish health ministry official.  There have now been 19,980 total cases recorded, said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, director of the Spanish Coordinating Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies, at a daily briefing. The 16.5% increase in cases recorded (up 2,833) was slower than in previous days, but Sim\u00f3n warned that many factors affect the number of cases confirmed. Some 1,141 of the recorded cases have been put into intensive care, Sim\u00f3n said. Some of the first people taken into intensive care are now being released, he added, though those numbers remain low. Some 10,542 of the total recorded cases have been hospitalized, which is 52% of the total, Sim\u00f3n said. On Thursday there had been 17,147 cases with 767 deaths. Novel coronavirus may not recede completely at the end of this season but its impact will likely be more modest in a future wave, the top US infectious disease doctor said Thursday. \u201cOnce we get by it, it is conceivable and maybe likely that when we get to the next season, we may see another blip of this, but it would really be different,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a live-streamed conversation with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The new coronavirus \u201cspreads too efficiently\u201d to disappear like SARS did, said Fauci. That means that even after this coronavirus outbreak is suppressed, a recurrence is \u201clikely -- not inevitable, but likely,\" he added. The comments came after Zuckerberg asked about the likelihood of another coronavirus wave, either in the fall or later. Fauci said that while it may happen, multiple factors would blunt the impact of future outbreaks.  First, \u201ca certain percentage of the population will already have been immune, a bit of what we call herd immunity.\u201d This means more people -- after recovering from coronavirus -- would be protected against future infections. And if a second wave comes, \u201cwe likely, by that time, will have tested a number of drugs,\u201d Fauci added. \u201cHopefully some of them will be effective in treatment.\u201d Finally, \u201cwe hopefully, within a year to a year and a half, would have a vaccine,\u201d Fauci said.  \u201cSo although we\u2019re preparing, and maybe expecting for it to come back, it\u2019s not going to come back in the same circumstances as it first came.\u201d Taiwan confirmed 27 new cases of coronavirus Friday in its largest single-day increase since the outbreak began. Twenty-four of the new cases were imported from countries including the UK, the US, Germany, France, Spain, Belgium and the Philippines, according to Taiwan's Center for Disease Control.  The spike in cases comes one day after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen warned the \"next 14 days will be a critical second stage in the epidemic response effort.\" The new cases bring Taiwan's total number of cases to 135, including one death.\u00a0 South African Airways (SAA) announced the immediate suspension of all international operations Friday until May 31, in response to the South African government\u2019s coronavirus-related travel ban. The airline also cited a \u201csubstantial decline in demand for air travel.\u201d  Five of SAA\u2019s international routes (Washington DC, New York JFK, London Heathrow, Frankfurt and Munich) are in countries listed as high risk in the South African government's  travel ban.  The airline\u2019s two other international legs, Perth and Sao Paulo, will also be suspended. SAA will continue to operate its domestic and regional routes.

On Thursday, Iran had announced\u00a0the same number of fatalities (149) since Wednesday, the country's highest spike in death toll over a 24-hour period since the coronavirus outbreak began. Earlier on Friday Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei praised the country\u2019s medical community and volunteers for their work in fighting the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe sacrifices made were so dazzling that even foreigners felt obliged to admire them,\u201d Khamenei said in his address to the nation to mark Persian New Year. \u201cThere were also support groups, some of which offered their factories and even their houses with the aim of manufacturing the products needed for patients ... products such as gloves, masks,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Iranian nation showed its virtues through these groups,\u201d Khamenei said. In his address, the leader did not mention the nationwide anti-government demonstrations in Iran last year. US states reported 4,581 new cases of novel coronavirus over the last 24 hours, according to a tally by CNN. CNN had tallied at least 8,898 cases with 149 deaths at 6 a.m. ET Thursday, rising to 13,479 total cases, with 196 deaths, one day later. This is an increase of 4,581 cases and 47 deaths.

The doctors participating will be volunteers, his office said in a statement Thursday.\u00a0 \"We are supporting the community that are on the front line to deal with this emergency, we continue to fight this battle with them,\" reads the statement.\u00a0 The number of coronavirus cases in Germany jumped by 2,958 in the last 24 hours to a total of 13,957, the head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's federal public health agency, said Friday. There have been 31 total deaths as a result of coronavirus, with 11 fatalities\u00a0in the last 24 hours, said RKI chief Lothar Wieler at a press conference in Berlin. ''We will see more fatalities over the next few weeks -- including here in Germany,\" Wieler said. The head of the RKI also warned about hospital capacity in the country.  \"More people will get infected; more people will be admitted to the emergency room and more people will require respiratory aid and therefore we have to fear that there will not be enough ventilator places,\" Wieler said. Germany is only at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, Wieler warned. He urged people to keep their distance to fight the pandemic, but said it is up to local authorities to decide on specific measures designed to achieve that.\u00a0 He went on to issue a stark warning. \"If there are still people in our country who don't believe this, who don't believe me, who think that this is panic making, then I can only call upon them to finally open their eyes to this reality,\" he said. \"If everyone sticks to what is set, we can slow down this epidemic by the maximum possible.\" The Changing the Guard ceremony at London's Buckingham Palace has been canceled until further notice in light of the coronavirus outbreak, Royal Communications said in a statement Friday. \"In line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings, it has been agreed that the ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St James\u2019s Palace and Windsor Castle will be postponed until further notice,\" reads the statement.\u00a0 \"Advice will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate.\" India\u2019s capital city of New Delhi announced restrictions on businesses and government services starting Friday, as did the country's second most populous state of Maharashtra.

The man was detained after refusing to self-isolate upon arriving from England by boat, and could face a three-month jail sentence or a \u00a310,000 ($11,800) fine, an Isle of Man Police spokesman told CNN. Anyone who travels to the Isle of Man -- a small British crown dependency that sits in the Irish Sea, between Britain and Ireland -- must self-isolate for 14 days under rules designed to stop the spread of coronavirus introduced Monday. You can\u2019t currently be arrested for not self-quarantining in the UK. \u00a0The 130,000 French citizens currently stranded abroad must show \u201cpatience\u201d as the government is trying to ensure they can return to the country, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Friday. Le Drian said the government was working on enabling their return \u201cas fast as possible\u201d but did not give an exact deadline.

The Ruby Princess, which traveled between Sydney and New Zealand, had been considered \u201clow risk\u201d according to\u00a0Kerry Chant, a health officer for the state of New South Wales. NSW Minister of Health Brad Hazzard said all passengers who left the cruise liner were asked to spend 14 days in quarantine at home. However, authorities are still concerned \"that those people came off the ship with no knowledge of Covid-19 actually being on the ship,\" Hazzard said. As of Friday afternoon local time, NSW Health officials have emailed and sent text messages to all cruise passengers advising them of the confirmed cases onboard the ship and to \"reinforce the importance of self-isolation and regular self-monitoring of symptoms.\"\u00a0 A total of 1,050 crew members are onboard the ship, according to NSW Health. While the three infected passengers got off the ship, the crew member who contracted the virus is still onboard and in isolation.

London: A city that should be emptying, but where instead sidewalks and stores are crammed, and\u00a0metro stations are closed. Rumors swirling\u00a0of a 15-day lockdown\u00a0mean nearly everyone you talk to is out panic-buying something, even if the government tries to insist \"lockdown\" is the wrong word. The\u00a0changing advice\u00a0and the lack of widespread testing leave the collective impression here that it is either too late to stop what is happening, or something, inescapable and mammoth, is looming. This densely packed city of over 9 million simply can't make up its mind. Some shelves are empty, but some bars full. \"It looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead\" of the rest of the country in the virus spread, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said out of nowhere on Monday. And given that the UK is meant to be a few weeks behind Italy, that gave the impression that collapse was imminent. But the lack of widespread testing here, means we -- and Johnson -- simply don't have the solid data, just the modeling.

Hong Kong's flagship carrier announced Friday that it would reduce passenger flight capacity by 96% in April and May, saying it would start operating on a \"bare skeleton\" basis. Cathay Dragon, the company's regional airline, will also cut back by the same proportion. The decision was made \"in light of the severe drop in demand due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and multiple government travel restrictions,\" the company said in a statement Friday. The reductions were largely expected. Cathay has already significantly shrunk capacity in recent months, cutting flights by 30% in February and 65% in March and April. The latest move extends previously announced cuts, the company said. Last week, the company also reported brutal financial results for 2019, and\u00a0warned\u00a0that a \"substantial loss\" was projected for the first half of this year and that more flight reductions were likely.

Nobody today can tell you what the developments are tomorrow, what they are in one month, not to mention in more than four months. Therefore it would not be responsible in any way to set a date or take a decision right now, which would be based on the speculation about the future developments.\" Many of the world's biggest and most profitable sports leagues have postponed, delayed or canceled major events to help combat the spread of the virus, leading some to question if the Olympics should be held.

Watch: More than 10,000 people have died after contracting the novel coronavirus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The grim milestone comes nearly three months after the virus was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.  Since then, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica and infected nearly 250,000 people worldwide, by JHU's estimates. The university is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources.\u00a0 The situation in Europe and the United States is getting increasingly dire. Italy's death toll surpassed that of mainland China yesterday, and according to Johns Hopkins, the country has now recorded more than 41,000 cases. Infections in the US surpassed 10,000 on Thursday, up from fewer than 100 at the beginning of the month. There may be even more, as not all patients can be tested because the US is currently dealing with a severe shortage of testing equipment. Progress at pandemic ground zero: Authorities in mainland China appear to be making notable progress in stopping the virus from spreading domestically -- no new local infections have been reported for two days in a row and 71,150 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the country's National Health Commission. ##Health## Saudi Arabia will shut down all domestic flights and public transportation -- including buses, taxis and trains -- for 14 days as a precautionary measure to control the spread of coronavirus, the country\u2019s state news agency SPA said on Friday.

Saudi\u00a0Arabia\u00a0has 274 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with no deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins\u00a0University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources.\u00a0 ##Travel## ##Business## ##Daily Life## Mainland China recorded 39 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday -- all imported from overseas, according to the country's National Health Commission. It's the second day that China reported no increase in domestically transmitted coronavirus cases. That's a pivotal moment for the country where the virus was first detected at the end of 2019. But it's also raising concerns that another outbreak from imported cases is just around the corner.  What is a second surge? It's essentially a \"second wave\" of infections or an outbreak that's come from infected people who have arrived in the country from overseas, after efforts to control an initial outbreak. Why is it a problem? Countries such as China, South Korea, and Singapore have seen caseloads stabilize in recent weeks, thanks largely to a combination of aggressive containment and social distancing measures. Tens of millions of people in mainland China and elsewhere in Asia were subjected to varying restrictions, with people unable to leave their homes or housing compounds, or go to work or school. A rise in infections linked to overseas travel has led to concerns that those sacrifices could be undone. Is there evidence it is happening? Singapore confirmed 47 additional novel coronavirus cases on Wednesday -- the largest single day increase in confirmed cases. The same day, Hong Kong reported its largest increase in new cases following a period when few infections were reported. Thirteen of the 14 new cases reported had recent travel history abroad. While the increase in numbers is not on the scale that some countries in Europe are reporting, the sudden jumps are a concerning trend.  What's been done about it? In mainland China, authorities have escalated\u00a0quarantine measures on international arrivals\u00a0to avoid further outbreaks. In the capital, Beijing, all passengers arriving from overseas are now required to go into \"collective quarantine at designated facilities.\" Beijing residents were previously allowed to quarantine themselves in their own homes. Singapore is requiring all travelers arriving in the country to undergo a mandatory 14-day home quarantine and has advised its citizens to defer all travel abroad. Hong Kong has issued a red notice for all foreign countries, requiring anyone arriving from overseas to undergo a 14-day home quarantine. Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and his wife sold as much as $1.7 million in stock last month ahead of\u00a0the sharp market decline\u00a0that's resulted from\u00a0the novel coronavirus global pandemic, according to Senate documents. Two weeks later, the North Carolina Republican sounded a blunt warning in February about the dire impact of the novel coronavirus during a private event in Washington, according to audio\u00a0obtained by NPR,\u00a0which contrasted with President Donald Trump's public statements at the time that suggested\u00a0the virus would disappear. Burr's committee has received periodic briefings on coronavirus as the outbreak has spread, but the committee did not receive briefings on the virus the week of Burr's stock sales, according to a source familiar with the matter. A week before his stock sell-off, Burr authored an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0with GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee titled, \"Coronavirus prevention steps the U.S. government is taking to protect you.\" Burr has also worked on legislation aiding US preparations for pandemics for years. On February 13, Burr and his wife sold between $628,000 and $1.7 million in stock in 33 transactions, according to Senate financial disclosure records. Burr and his spouse also sold between $80,000 and $200,000 of stock on January 31, and purchased between $16,000 and $65,000 of stock on February 4. The majority of the sales were from Burr's wife, the records show, between $520,000 and $1.2 million. There's no indication that the stock sales were made on the basis of any inside information Burr received as a senator, or that he broke any Senate rules by selling the stock. Congress passed the Stock Act in 2012 that made it illegal for lawmakers to use inside information for financial benefit. Burr was one of three senators to vote against the bill.
