In an effort to meet the skyrocketing demand for social distancing supplies, Amazon is only restocking essential goods in its warehouses through at least April 5. Some customers hoping to take advantage of convenient Prime shipping can expect to wait up to a month for many items, meaning it's time to diversify your online shopping habits.  To help, we've rounded up a long list of stores to fill the Amazon-shaped hole in your heart. Though many of the retailers below have shuttered their physical locations, all are still fulfilling online orders at this time and can deliver essential and nonessential goods alike. Most big box stores like Target, Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Overstock are still up and running online, and offer a huge variety of products in the categories below.  The unfortunate truth is that pretty much all retailers are experiencing some shipping delays due to the pandemic, but you will still get what you need delivered within a few days.  But if you have a favorite clothing, game, or homegoods shop nearby, this is a great time to check if it's completing online orders; many small stores are waiving or reducing shipping fees in the wake of social distancing, and you'll be supporting your local economy.
