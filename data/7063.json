In case you missed it, here are some of the highlights from today's proceedings: The John Bolton manuscript: Much of the attention on Capitol Hill focused on the Republican senators and how they are reacting to Sunday night's\u00a0New York Times bombshell\u00a0that John Bolton's draft manuscript\u00a0says Trump told him US security assistance\u00a0to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\nTrump's defense team reacts to the Bolton news: President Trump lawyer and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz argued that Bolton\u2019s accusations do not amount to an impeachable offense.\u00a0\"Let me repeat: Nothing in the Bolton revelations \u2014 even if true \u2014 would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense,\u201d Dershowitz said.\nGOP senators downplayed the Bolton manuscript: Republican Sen. John Cornyn downplayed the significance of Bolton's revelation. Cornyn said the timing around this was suspicious and accused Democrats of having a \"credibility problem.\"\nWhile others said they wouldn't mind learning more from Bolton: GOP Sen. Mitt\u00a0Romney of Utah reiterated demands to call for John Bolton to testify, saying he\u2019s had discussions with some of his colleagues on the matter. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said today that he wants to see Bolton's manuscript. \u201cWhat we have to do here is evaluate the manuscript and see if it's a reason to add to the record,\u201d he said. \nWhite House officials were blindsided: Bolton\u2019s\u00a0upcoming book\u00a0blindsided senior White House officials and GOP senators who now want to know more about Bolton\u2019s side of the story as laid out in his manuscript, multiple sources close\u00a0to the process told CNN. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not notified in advance about the unpublished manuscript, his spokesperson said.\nIt was Chief Justice John Roberts' birthday: Chief Justice\u00a0John Roberts celebrated his 65th\u00a0birthday today and has been\u00a0presiding over\u00a0the Senate\u00a0impeachment trial. Roberts also appeared briefly on the Supreme Court bench to swear in a roomful of military lawyers to the Supreme Court bar. Roberts was joined by five other members of the court.\u00a0\nThere was lots of note-taking: During the defense\u2019s argument today, Republican senators and some Democrats took copious notes. Everyone appeared present and attentive. There were no absences.\u00a0\nTrump defense team compares presidential impeachment to \"domestic war\": Trump's lawyer Kenneth Starr said in his remarks today, \"Like war, impeachment is hell.\u00a0Or, at least, presidential\u00a0impeachment is hell.\"\u00a0 The Senate impeachment trial will resume at 1 p.m. ET tomorrow. After virtually ignoring the Bolton manuscript bombshell news through nearly eight hours of their presentation today, President Trump lawyer and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz argued that John Bolton\u2019s accusations do not amount to an impeachable offense.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf a president, any president, were to have done what the Times reported about the content of the Bolton manuscript, that would not constitute an impeachable offense. Let me repeat: Nothing in the Bolton revelations \u2014 even if true \u2014 would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense,\u201d Dershowitz said. Earlier today, Jay Sekulow, the President\u2019s private counsel, alluded to bombshell allegations over the weekend from former national security adviser John Bolton directly tying Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens. But he suggested it would not be discussed by the team today. \"What we've done on Saturday is the pattern that we're going to continue today as far as how we're going to deal with the case. We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all,\" he said. What's this about: The New York Times reported Trump ordered\u00a0Bolton to keep military aid to Ukraine frozen in a bid to coerce political favors. Since the news broke, some GOP senators are considering the need to have witnesses at the trial. During his remarks tonight, President Trump's attorney Alan Dershowitz talked about how he saw the impeachments of Trump and Clinton as different \u2014\u00a0and how the charges against Trump led him to change his mind about what constitutes an impeachable offense by a president. On former president Bill Clinton, Dershowitz said, \"Clinton was accused of a crime,\u00a0perjury, and so the issue in\u00a0his case was not whether the\u00a0Constitution requires a crime\u00a0for impeachment, instead, the\u00a0engine was whether Clinton's\u00a0alleged crime could be\u00a0classified as a high crime in\u00a0light of its personal nature.\"\u00a0 He continued: \"During the Clinton impeachment,\u00a0I stated in an interview that I\u00a0did not think that the\u00a0technical crime was required\u00a0but that I did think that\u00a0abusing trust could be\u00a0considered.\"\u00a0 Dershowitz said that at the time of Clinton's impeachment, he had not done \"extensive research on that\u00a0issue\" of whether criminal behavior was required to impeach a president. \"I simply accepted\u00a0the academic consensus on an\u00a0issue that was not on the front\u00a0burner at the time,\" he said.  With Trump, Dershowitz said his impeachment \"directly\u00a0raises the issue of whether\u00a0criminal behavior is required.\"  \"I've gone back and read all the\u00a0relevant historical material,\u00a0as nonpartisan academic should\u00a0always do, and have now\u00a0concluded that the framers did\u00a0intend to limit the criteria\u00a0for impeachment the criminal\u00a0type backs akin to treason,\u00a0bribery, and they certainly did\u00a0not intend do extended to vague\u00a0an open-ended non criminal\u00a0accusations such as abuse of\u00a0power and obstruction of\u00a0Congress.\" Moments after Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz began remarks on the Senate floor, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared briefly on Fox Business. President Trump, she said, has been \u201cvery, very happy\u201d with his legal team, touting a \u201cstrong team with decades of legal experience.\u201d On Bolton, Grisham called it \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cdisappointing\u201d that the former White House national security adviser is \u201cclearly trying to sell a book,\u201d noting that the preorder link was live moments after the New York Times story published.  She also questioned whether Bolton was telling the truth. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if what\u2019s in the book is going to be true,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe President has made clear that none of the things in the book are true.\u201d Grisham repeatedly called it \u201csad.\u201d The proposal for witness reciprocity is not something most GOP senators are actively pursuing and it is essentially a backup plan in case enough Republicans vote to hear witnesses, Republican Sen. Mike Braun said. \u201cFirst of all, Ted (Cruz) and I have been talking about reciprocity on witnesses and anybody that has talked (has said) if we get to witnesses.\u00a0That was never going to occur in a vacuum ... it wasn\u2019t even discussed really, it was discussed if we get there, that\u2019s the how it would be.\u00a0I don\u2019t think Pat originated it, he just, I guess, would be comfortable with it,\" the Indiana lawmaker said. Earlier today: Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from\u00a0Pennsylvania, raised the \"one for one\" witness deal that would allow for one witness each to be called by both the Republican and Democratic sides in the Senate impeachment trial at the GOP conference lunch today, a source familiar told CNN.\u00a0 Braun also said the discussion in the lunch today on witnesses was tangential to the main discussion in the lunch which was about the upcoming question and answer process. President Trump's impeachment attorney Robert Ray concluded his opening remarks with what the President told him.  \"The President's only instruction to me for this trial was a simple one: 'Do what you think is right,'\" Ray said. Ray added that he does not believe that Trump's impeachment is in \"the best\u00a0interests of this country.\"  Asked about GOP Rep. Mark Meadows\u2019s suggestion that the New York Times story on John Bolton was a coordinated leak from Democrats and if he was in any way involved in the leak, House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff said he was not. \u201cOf course not,\u201d Schiff said, \u201cIt came as quite a surprise to all the House managers when the New York Times story came out, but I guess that\u2019s the best Representative Meadows has right now. Look I can understand the reasons why \u2014\u00a0and I think we knew these already \u2014\u00a0why the President and his allies have wanted to suppress John Bolton\u2019s testimony. They evidentially had this manuscript, they understood what John Bolton had to say and they were deathly afraid the American people would find out.\" Schiff continued: \"There seems to be a real shift in where the Republican senators are and I think it\u2019s very hard for them to maintain that they wanted a fair trial, wanted to know all the facts when there\u2019s a witness who said I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ve got something to say, we have an outline of what he has to say, it\u2019s really hard to say we\u2019re not going to hear that.\u201d  Asked if\u00a0the House would reconsider bringing in former White House national security adviser John Bolton if the Senate decides not call trial witnesses, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said they would consider it, but he wouldn\u2019t speculate beyond that.\u00a0 \u201cWe'd certainly consider what action we would take. I don't know, I don't want to speak of what action we\u00a0would take,\" he said. The Senate impeachment trial has resumed. Robert Ray, a member of President Trump's defense team, is delivering his opening arguments right now. Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina and a stark defender of the President, suggested today that the John Bolton manuscript was leaked to convince GOP senators to vote for witnesses. He also said he's not in favor of calling additional witnesses. \"Why was this leaked out at this particular time right before today's presentation by the Trump defense team? I know I'm asking that. Some have suggested that it was to sell more books. Some have suggested that indeed the leak was designed to create chaos. What we do know is that this is a pattern that my Democrat colleagues have embarked on when it was over in the House, and they continue to leak out things trying to change the narrative so that you will write about it, so that the American people can get all worried about it, only to find out the facts later don't necessarily support the accusations that were made,\" he said. Meadows continued: \"My Republican colleagues in the Senate are going to make up their own minds on whether or not to call witnesses, but this leak was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to try to manipulate the thinking of my Republican colleagues in the Senate to encourage them to open it up and provide for more witnesses,\" he said. \"I'm not in favor of calling additional witnesses,\" he added. \u00a0 GOP Sens. Ted Cruz, Mike Braun, John Barrasso and Joni Ernst spoke to reporters this evening, praising the defense team and discussing the possibility of witnesses.\u00a0 \"The White House counsel has absolutely shredded, shredded the case brought forward,\" Ernst said. Cruz claimed that the defense team outlined \u201cserious evidence of corruption involving Burisma.\u201d \u201cI get that the press loves to obsess over the latest bombshell,\u201d Cruz said of the New York Times report on John Bolton, downplaying the impact. \u201cAt the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t impact the legal issue before the Senate. The legal issue before this Senate is whether a president has the authority to investigate corruption.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIf we get to witnesses, it will be a one-for-one or a two-for-two,\u201d Braun said when asked about the possibility of reciprocity.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to decide Friday on witnesses,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a one-sided issue.\u201d President\u00a0Trump watched parts of his defense team's presentation today, a White\u00a0House\u00a0official said. Trump is pleased with his defense team's performance today, the\u00a0official said. Aides briefed Trump on portions of the trial he did not see, the official said. Meanwhile, sources close to the President's legal team said they will be prepared in the event John Bolton testifies and that Trump reserves the right to assert executive privilege should his attorneys decide to take that approach. It's up to the lawyers, sources said.  Trump has previously sounded cool to the idea of seeing Bolton testify, portraying it as a national security concern. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has taken the same position throughout the defense counsel\u2019s presentations \u2014 sitting sideways on the table to face the speaker directly, breaking his gaze only to take notes on his legal pad.  Schiff didn\u2019t break his gaze as President's Trump lawyer Eric Herschmann repeatedly turned his direction during the presentation to attack Schiff and the other managers, staring back at Herschmann without expression when he looked over. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney also did not react when he was cited by Herschmann for his comment in a 2012 debate with President Barack Obama that Russia was the No. 1 geopolitical foe of the US. Romney looked straight ahead while the clip of Obama was played and his facial expression did not change. When the Trump team played a video montage of Schiff, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others saying it was urgent that they impeach the President, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell broke out a rare smile, while Sen. Ted Cruz chuckled. President Trump's lawyer Pam Bondi played a video clip of former vice president Joe Biden recounting, at a 2018 event, how he had pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Bondi claimed that Shokin was, at the time of the pressure in late 2015 and early 2016, \u201cinvestigating Burisma,\u201d the company where Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors. Here are four key facts Bondi omitted: 1. Shokin\u2019s former deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, said the investigation into Burisma and company owner\u00a0Mykola Zlochevsky\u00a0was inactive at the time of Joe Biden\u2019s pressure in late 2015 and early 2016. A leading Ukrainian anti-corruption activist said the same. \"Shokin was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma,\" Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center,\u00a0told the Washington Post\u00a0for a July article. \"And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\" 2. Shokin was widely seen \u2014 by Ukrainian activists, US diplomats, European governments and the International Monetary Fund\u00a0\u2014 as ineffective or corrupt. In a speech in 2015, Geoffrey Pyatt, then the US ambassador to Ukraine, castigated Shokin\u2019s office for impeding the investigation of Burisma\u2019s owner Zlochevsky. Pyatt called for people in Shokin\u2019s office to be fired, \u201cat minimum.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cRather than supporting Ukraine\u2019s reforms and working to root out corruption, corrupt actors within the prosecutor general\u2019s office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform,\u201d\u00a0Pyatt said. 3. Biden was acting in accordance with official US policy.\u00a0Because of Shokin\u2019s reputation, the US and its allies believed that removing him would increase, not decrease, the chances of people like\u00a0Zlochevsky being pursued. \"What former Vice President Biden requested of former president of Ukraine, (Petro) Poroshenko, was the removal of a corrupt prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin,\u201d George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, testified in the impeachment inquiry. Kent went on to say Shokin had \u201cundermined\u201d a US-funded program to try to investigate corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors.\u00a0 4. Some Republican senators had also demanded changes to the prosecutor general\u2019s office Shokin led. In a bipartisan 2016 letter, Republican senators\u00a0Rob Portman, Mark Kirk and Ron Johnson joined Democratic colleagues in calling on then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\u00a0to \"press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General's office and judiciary.\" Andrew Bates, campaign director for former vice president Joe Biden's campaign, has issued a statement slamming President Trump\u2019s attorney Pam Bondi's presentation this afternoon. Bondi outlined the issue of Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, during her 30-minute presentation.\u00a0 \"We didn't realize that Breitbart was expanding into Ted Talk knockoffs. Here on Planet Earth, the conspiracy theory that Bondi repeated has been conclusively refuted,\" Bates said in the statement. He continued: \"The New York Times calls it 'debunked,' The Wall Street Journal calls it 'discredited,' the AP calls it 'incorrect,' and The Washington Post Fact Checker calls it 'a fountain of falsehoods.'\u00a0The diplomat that Trump himself appointed to lead his Ukraine policy has blasted it as 'self serving' and 'not credible.'\u00a0Joe Biden was instrumental to a bipartisan and international anti-corruption victory. It's no surprise that such a thing is anathema to President Trump.\" The Senate impeachment trial just took a 45-minute break for dinner. After senators return from the break, President Trump's defense team will resume their opening arguments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the reported contents of John Bolton\u2019s book came to her as \u201cno surprise.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been for witnesses and documentation all along. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the senators have to say. But I\u2019m the last person to ask about it,\u201d she said as she arrived for a meeting with her leadership team. She didn\u2019t answer follow up questions. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from\u00a0Pennsylvania, raised the \"one for one\" witness deal that would allow for one witness each to be called by both the Republican and Democratic sides in the Senate impeachment trial at the GOP conference lunch today, a source familiar told CNN.\u00a0 This has been a topic of conversation among Senate GOP for sometime.\u00a0 The Washington Post first reported the Toomey idea this afternoon. Both the White House and GOP leadership want this trial to end as soon as possible and not go down this route. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has no appetite for this, and this tactic will only be employed if they\u2019re about to lose the witness vote. So this is the last resort. Toomey\u2019s office is declining to comment at the moment.\u00a0 GOP Sen. Mike Braun confirmed a discussion about the one-for-one trade on witnesses occurred at lunch today. Braun said that at the lunch, Republican senators indicated that if they do move forward on witnesses, Democrats need to be prepared for witnesses sought by the GOP.\u00a0 \"If we get to the questions of witnesses, and people think they need them, there would be a back-and-forth: a Democratic witness, a Republican witness,\u201d Braun said\u00a0 Pam Bondi, former Florida attorney general and a member of President Trump\u2019s defense team, outlined the issue of Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, during her 30-minute presentation. This was the first direct reference to the Bidens during the defense team\u2019s presentations. House managers, she said, \u201crepeatedly referenced\u201d Biden and Burisma more than \u201c400 times\u201d during their presentations last week, \u201cbut they never gave you the full picture.\u201d \u201cWe would prefer not to be talking about this,\u201d she claimed, \u201cBut the House managers have placed this squarely at issue, so we must address it.\u201d\u00a0 Citing multiple news reports and testimony from State Department official George Kent and other witnesses, Bondi cast the company as corrupt and Biden\u2019s involvement as a conflict of interest. She questioned his qualifications to serve on the board, an opportunity she called \u201cnepotistic at best, nefarious at worst.\u201d There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Bondi noted that then-Vice President Joe Biden sought to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Victor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. However, she did not note that Shokin was widely accused of corruption and a Shokin deputy has said the Burisma probe was dormant.\u00a0 \u201cThere was a basis to talk about this, to raise this issue, and that is enough,\u201d Bondi said. \u00a0 Watch part of the defense's exhibit on Biden: Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff released a statement today during the Senate impeachment trial regarding the Ukraine aid. \"At no time did I hear him tie aid to Ukraine to investigations into the Biden family or Burisma,\" Pence staffer Marc Short said. Here's his full statement: \u201cAs matter of policy we don\u2019t typically share or discuss conversations between the President and Vice President, but given the journalistic fury over alleged conversations, the President has given me permission to set the record straight. In every conversation with the President and the Vice President in preparation for our trip to Poland, the President consistently expressed his frustration that the United States was bearing the lion\u2019s share of responsibility for aide to Ukraine and that European nations weren\u2019t doing their part.\u00a0The President also expressed concerns about corruption in Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0At no time did I hear him tie aid to Ukraine to investigations into the Biden family or Burisma.\u00a0As White House Counsel presented today, based upon testimony provided by Democrat witnesses in the House hearings, these were the only issues that the Vice President discussed with Ukrainian officials \u2014 because that\u2019s what the President asked him to raise.\u201d There appeared to be a lot of note-taking at the House impeachment manager table today with Reps. Adam Schiff, Zoe Lofgren and Hakeem Jeffries frequently bending their heads over the desk to write things down as the defense gave its presentation.  Schiff, as he has done before, also frequently looked on at the defense as they made their arguments. When Trump attorney Jane Raskin argued that so far the score is \u201cMayor Giuliani 4, Mr. Schiff, 0,\u201d Schiff stared right at her unflinchingly. Rudy Giuliani tweeted his thanks to President Trump's lawyer Jane Raskin for her defense of him in her opening argument. \"Jane Raskin is doing a masterful job defending me in my role as defense counsel,\" he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not notified in advance about the unpublished manuscript from former national security adviser John Bolton's upcoming book, his spokesperson said. \u201cThe leader did not have any advance notice,\" the spokesperson said. About the manuscript: The New York Times reported Trump ordered\u00a0Bolton to keep military aid to Ukraine frozen in a bid to coerce political favors. Given yesterday's report from the New York Times\u00a0that a manuscript of John Bolton\u2019s unpublished book alleges President Trump linked aid to Ukraine with investigations into Democrats, including Joe Biden, the former national security adviser looms large over the impeachment trial of President Trump.\u00a0 Throughout this morning, senators were pressed by reporters about whether they would vote to call Bolton to testify at Trump\u2019s trial.  But Trump\u2019s defense team did not mention Bolton\u2019s name in its initial arguments. Trump lawyer Ken Starr spoke for nearly an hour, focusing on the history of presidential impeachment. He mentioned former president Richard Nixon at least 10 times, former president Andrew Johnson at least five, and Bolton not once. Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow appeared to nod toward Bolton in his own early comments on Monday, saying: \u201cWe deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all.\u201d Sekulow repeated the list of six arguments the President\u2019s defense team introduced in its initial presentation on Saturday. One of the six items was this: \u201cNot a single witness\u00a0testified that the President himself said that that there was any connection between any investigation and security assistance, a presidential\u00a0meeting or anything else.\u201d Sekulow\u2019s claim was not false, since Bolton was not a witness in the House impeachment process \u2014 having declined a Democratic request to appear voluntarily. But it is still possible the Senate will vote to subpoena Bolton in the ongoing trial. President Trump's lawyer Jane Raskin accused Democrats of exaggerating Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role in the Ukraine affair. \u201cIn this trial, in this moment, Mr. Giuliani is just a minor player, that shiny object designed to distract you,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cSenators, I urge you most respectfully, do not be distracted.\u201d This ignores testimony from several witnesses, who said the President\u00a0directed them to coordinate with Giuliani\u00a0on Ukraine policy. It also ignores the fact that Giuliani\u2019s name came up six times during Trump\u2019s\u00a0July 25 phone call\u00a0with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\u00a0 Here are all the times Giuliani was mentioned in the call: Zelensky: \"I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with\u00a0Mr. Giuliani\u00a0just recently and we are hoping very much that\u00a0Mr. Giuliani\u00a0will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.\"\nTrump:\u00a0\"Mr. Giuliani\u00a0is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General.\u00a0Rudy\u00a0very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy.\"\nTrump: \"I will have\u00a0Mr. Giuliani\u00a0give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.\"\nTrump:\u00a0\"Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell\u00a0Rudy\u00a0and Attorney General Barr to call.\" \u00a0 Jane Raskin, one of President Trump's lawyers, argued that the House managers are focused on the President's private attorney Rudy Giuliani to \"distract from the fact that the evidence does not support their claims.\" \"If both the law and the facts\u00a0are against you, present a\u00a0distraction, emphasize the\u00a0sensational fact or perhaps a\u00a0colorful and controversial\u00a0public figure who appears on the\u00a0scene, then disport certain\u00a0facts and ignore others, even\u00a0when they are the most\u00a0problem\u00a0probative, make conclusory statements and insinuate the shining object is far more important than the actual facts allow. In short, divert attention from the holes in your\u00a0case,\" she said. Raskin continued: \"Rudy Giuliani is the House\u00a0managers' colorful distraction.\u00a0He's a household name.\" During the short break, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer refuted the Trump defense team's claim that none of the Democrats' witnesses spoke to the President himself about Ukraine. \"[Jay] Sekulow said when he listed his five points, not a single witness said they heard from POTUS himself. We want Bolton, we want Mulvaney. We can solve Mr. Sekulow\u2019s problem of not hearing from the witnesses themselves,\" Schumer said. \"It\u2019s a little like Watergate in that every week more evidence comes out further condemning the president. Obviously, the New York Times revelations strengthens the case. The average American is saying why don\u2019t they want witnesses and documents?\" Schumer said. Asked if he thought the House should subpoena the manuscript or Bolton, he said, \"That\u2019s going to be up to them. I\u2019m not going to give them advice.\" Deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura downplayed allegations that President Trump withheld a White House invitation from the new Ukrainian president as leverage to secure investigations into his political rivals. The allegations of a quid pro quo are at the center of the abuse-of-power charge against Trump, and have been supported by witnesses who testified in the House. But Purpura said this narrative was \u201cnonsense\u201d because Ukraine didn\u2019t announce investigations, and Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in September, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\u00a0 \u201cYou are probably wondering, how could the House managers claim that there was a quid pro quo for a meeting with President Trump when the two presidents actually did meet without President Zelensky announcing any investigations?\u201d Purpura asked. Purpura continued, \u201cWell, the House managers moved the goalposts again. They claimed the meeting could not be just an in-person meeting with President Trump, what it had to be was a meeting at the Oval Office and in the White House. That's nonsense.\u201d But this argument glosses over the differences between a short meeting at the UN and the symbolic value of a White House visit. Remember: Some witnesses testified in the House inquiry that Zelensky wanted an invitation to the White House because it was important for him to send a signal to the Kremlin, and other adversaries, that his new administration in Ukraine had strong support from the US.\u00a0 Purpura\u2019s comments ignores several relevant statements from Zelensky himself, who repeatedly told Trump that he wants to visit Washington specifically. This happened in both of their phone calls last year, according to rough transcripts released by the White House. Zelensky even made a joke during their meeting in New York\u00a0that Trump \u201cforgot\u201d to give him a date for the DC visit.

CNN's Nicolle Okoren contributed\u00a0reporting The Senate is back from a brief break. President Trump's legal team will continue to give their opening arguments.  In the hours after the New York Times broke the John Bolton story, Republican senators began reaching out to the White House to control the damage.  Both Sens. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and ally of Trump\u2019s, as well as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were in communication and there was an expressed view that the GOP Senate should have been kept in the loop. One message conveyed to the White House, according to a GOP senator with knowledge of the conversations, was that Republicans were on the front lines of the trial and for them to be left without all available information was \u201cmalpractice.\u201d\u00a0 One source told CNN that the National Security Council statement came as a result of conversations with GOP senators. That statement made it clear that only a small number of people would have had access to the manuscript.\u00a0 \u201cAmbassador Bolton\u2019s manuscript was submitted to the NSC for pre-publications review and has been under initial review by the NSC. No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript,\u201d the NSC statement said. The message was also that the President\u2019s team needed to defend the President, but lean less into focusing on what Trump did or did not do, and instead focus on why what is alleged to have happened did not rise to the level of impeachment.\u00a0 In the last week, GOP leaders have pressed upon their members that the outcome of this impeachment is inevitable. Trump won\u2019t be removed from office. Therefore, a prolonged fight over witnesses, court battles, and continued paralysis of the Senate chamber is just more pain for an outcome that isn\u2019t going to change. Members appeared to be coming around to that, and largely, seem to be in the same place today. But, the Bolton news shook that rationale, and GOP senators close to the White House needed to remind the President\u2019s team that the job of keeping the party in line can\u2019t happen if there are going to be unnecessary surprises.\u00a0 The jolt to the conference was apparent in the hours after the Bolton draft was disclosed, aides said, with rank-and-file senators scrambling to figure out the ramifications. It\u2019s part of what drove McConnell\u2019s message in the closed door Senate GOP lunch Monday \u2013 one summarized by multiple senators in attendance as \u201ctake a deep breath.\u201d\u00a0 During the first hour of the defense\u2019s argument today, Republican senators and some Democrats took copious notes.  Everyone appeared present and attentive. There were no absences or fidget spinners.\u00a0 Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins took notes as Trump attorney Ken Starr spoke and said \u201cinstead of a once in a century phenomenon, which it had been, presidential impeachment has become a weapon to be wielded against ones political opponent.\u201d  GOP Sen. Mitt Romney picked up his pen when Starr emphasized that Nixon\u2019s impeachment was the first in 100 years.  When Starr added that Nixon\u2019s impeachment was \u201cpowerfully bipartisan,\u201d Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander also picked up his pen. Alexander jotted notes when Starr noted a minute later that impeachment \u201cdivides the country like nothing else.\u201d The Senate impeachment trial is now taking a short break. When they come back, President Trump's legal team will continue its opening arguments. President Trump's legal team is centering its case against impeachment around six key facts they say \"have not and will not change.\"  Deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura introduced them\u00a0on Saturday and the President's attorney Jay Sekulow repeated them on Monday.\u00a0 \u201cThe transcript shows that the President did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call,\u201d Sekulow said.\u00a0\n\u201cPresident Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call.\u201d\n\u201cNot a single witness testified that the President himself said that that there was any connection between any investigation and security assistance, a presidential meeting or anything else.\u201d\n\u201cThe security assistance flowed on September 11 and a presidential meeting took place on September 25th without the Ukrainian government, without Ukrainian government announcing any investigations.\n\u201cIn the blind drive to impeach the president, President Trump, in reality, strategically has been the best friend and supporter of Ukraine certainly in our recent history. These are the facts.\u201d CNN\u2019s fact-check team went through each of these claims on Saturday. You can read the full break down here.\u00a0 Both Pat Cipollone and Mike Purpura of the President's legal team claimed today that Ukraine did not know military aid was being withheld at the time of the July 25 phone call, implying that there could effectively be no quid pro quo between the parties.\u00a0 They made the same claim on Saturday during their opening arguments.  \"President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call,\" Purpura said Saturday. Facts First:\u00a0It's unclear when exactly top Ukrainian government officials knew that nearly $400 million in military and security aid was being withheld. But there is evidence that some of them suspected there was an issue with the funding as early as July 25, the same day as President Trump's phone call with Zelensky. According to\u00a0testimony\u00a0from\u00a0Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, some members of her staff told her that they had received queries about the aid from Ukrainian officials on July 25. Cooper did not, however, know if the Ukrainian officials were aware of a hold on the aid or were just checking in. The New York Times\u00a0reported that, according to Olena Zerkal, an ex-top official in Kiev, members of the Ukrainian government knew the aid was being held up at some point in late July, but Zerkal could not recall the exact date. As Purpura noted on Saturday, the withholding of military aid was not brought up in meetings between Ukraine and US officials. It wasn't until Politico\u00a0reported\u00a0in late August that Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine that top Zelensky adviser, Andrey Yermak, texted Kurt Volker, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, with a link to the article and a message \"we need to talk.\"\u00a0 This could be due to the unusual\u00a0process\u00a0of how the aid was withheld. The Office of Management and Budget has declined to turn over documents to investigators related to the withholding of the aid. The President\u2019s defense team showed a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi passing out pens to impeachment managers after signing the articles of impeachment earlier this month. Attorney Jay Sekulow lambasted Democrats' \u201ccelebratory moment.\u201d \u201cPens distributed to the impeachment managers. A celebratory moment. Think about that. Think about this. A poignant moment,\u201d Sekulow said.  Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, have previously railed against the souvenir pens. \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s souvenir pens served up on silver platters to sign the sham articles of impeachment...She was so somber as she gave them away to people like prizes,\u201d Grisham\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Twitter. Watch the moment:  Trump defense team member Ken Starr delivered his argument before the Senate on Monday, asserting that since President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment, Congress has turned to impeachment for political motivations. Starr, who pulled frequently from historical precedent, argued that the US is in the \u201cage of impeachment.\u201d \"Indeed, we are living under what, I think,\u00a0can aptly be described as\u00a0the age\u00a0of\u00a0impeachment,\u201d Starr said.  He continued: \u201cIn the wake of the long national nightmare\u00a0of\u00a0Watergate, Congress and President Jimmy Carter collaboratively\u00a0ushered in a new chapter in\u00a0America's constitutional\u00a0history.\u00a0Together in full agreement, they\u00a0enacted the Independent Counsels Provisions of The Ethics and Government\u00a0Act\u00a0of\u00a01978. But the new chapter was not\u00a0simply the\u00a0age\u00a0of\u00a0independent\u00a0counsels.\u00a0It became, unbeknownst to the\u00a0American people, the\u00a0age\u00a0of\u00a0impeachment.\u201d\u00a0 Starr, who served as independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation, called impeachment \u201ca weapon to be wielded against one\u2019s political opponent,\u201d but not used against early \u201ccontroversial presidents,\u201d like Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Greg Wallace,\u00a0Olanma Mang and Mariah Espada contributed to this report. John Bolton has denied that he and his publishers coordinated any \"appearance of information about his book,\" according to his PAC director. \"Any assertion to the contrary is unfounded speculation,\" Sarah Tinsley, the director of the John Bolton PAC, said in a statement. Here's the full statement: \"Ambassador John Bolton, Simon & Schuster, and Javelin Literary categorically state that there was absolutely no coordination with the New York Times or anyone else regarding the appearance of information about his book, THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED, at online booksellers. Any assertion to the contrary is unfounded speculation.\" Sens. Kevin Cramer and Mike Braun laid out what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's message was in the conference lunch today Sen. Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, says that McConnell reminded members that they included a vote on witnesses in the resolution, and members will get that opportunity. But for now, the focus is on listening to the next two steps of the process: Trump\u2019s counsel and the question-and-answer portion. Cramer said he did not get the sense from lunch that the Bolton news was fundamentally shifting things: \"The Bolton thing is just a new wrinkle, but not really overly concerning to anyone.\"\u00a0 \"For me personally, I don\u2019t confuse book-selling with a trial,\" he said. Cramer said he \"did not know\" if Trump\u2019s counsel would approach the topic of Bolton today. On whether he detected more of a sentiment among his colleagues to hear from witnesses, Cramer said, \"I think it is about the same as it has always been to be honest.\" Sen. Braun explained McConnell's message at lunch, saying essentially that GOP members shouldn't lock themselves into a position before the defense team makes its case and senators ask questions. \"His message is what it's been all along: Let's get through the next step. We knew we were going to cross that threshold. There's now more information out there. Other than that, that was it. Take a deep breath, and take it one step at a time.\" Asked if he specifically said, \"deep breath,\" Braun said he was paraphrasing McConnell, who made the case to \"keep cool\" and \"we will get there.\" Braun also said that at the lunch, Republican senators said if they do move forward on witnesses, Democrats need to be prepared for witnesses sought by the GOP. \"If we get to the questions of witnesses, and people think they need them, there would be a back-and-forth: A Democratic witness, a Republican witness.\" Trump impeachment attorney Kenneth Starr walked through the charges in the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton and the impeachment inquiry of Richard Nixon. He's arguing that no crimes were committed in Trump's case, undermining the validity of impeachment. \"Were\u00a0crimes\u00a0alleged in the\u00a0articles in the common law of\u00a0presidential impeachment?\u00a0In Nixon, yes.\u00a0In Clinton, yes.\u00a0Here, no,\" he said. Remember: Impeachment doesn't need to be based on a statutory crime, according to CNN legal analyst Elie Honig. Here's how Honig put it: The Constitution\u00a0prescribes\u00a0impeachment for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" But the term \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute law, and appears to be\u00a0drawn from\u00a0English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond the reach of established criminal law.\nOur own precedent supports the notion that a crime is not necessary for impeachment. President Andrew Johnson was\u00a0impeached\u00a0by the House (and then acquitted by the Senate) for firing a secretary of war \u2014 certainly not a criminal act. Drafted\u00a0articles of impeachment\u00a0against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to\u00a0abuse of power\u00a0for non-criminal conduct. A source familiar with the\u00a0John Bolton's book suggested the full information within the unpublished manuscript was damning to President Trump and would make it much harder for Republican senators to play the \u201cnothing new here\u201d card.\u00a0 The source also responded to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s comments on wanting to see it, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure he does.\u201d\u00a0 More on this: Graham told CNN that he wants to see the Bolton manuscript. \u201cWhat we have to do here is evaluate the manuscript and see if it's a reason to add to the record,\u201d he said.  Asked if he would support a subpoena to get the manuscript, the South Carolina Republican said, \u201cI want to know what's in the manuscript, yeah, I think that\u2019s important.\u201d\u00a0 He said the manuscript could change his thinking on calling witnesses.\u00a0 \u201cIt could. I don\u2019t know yet. The White House said there was no direct evidence of communications, maybe this suggests that one person said there might be,\" Graham said. Trump defense attorney Kenneth Starr said in his remarks today, \"Like war, impeachment is hell.\u00a0Or, at least, presidential\u00a0impeachment is hell.\"\u00a0 He went on to invoke the Clinton impeachment, comparing a presidential impeachment to \"domestic war.\" \"Those of us who lived through\u00a0the Clinton impeachment,\u00a0including members of this body,\u00a0full well understand that a\u00a0presidential impeachment is\u00a0tantamount to domestic war, but\u00a0thankfully protected by our\u00a0beloved First Amendment, a war\u00a0of words and a war of ideas.\u00a0But it's filled with acrimony\u00a0and it divides the country like\u00a0nothing else.\u00a0Those of us who lived through\u00a0the Clinton impeachment\u00a0understand that in a deep and\u00a0personal way.\" Remember: Starr was the prosecutor best known for his work that led to\u00a0President Bill Clinton's impeachment\u00a0in the 1990s. He is presenting for the first time today as a member of President Trump's defense team. Watch the moment: House manager Adam Schiff and his staff have not had any conversations with former national security John Bolton or his team since the developments about his book, a Democratic source said. About his book: The New York Times reported Trump ordered\u00a0former national security adviser John Bolton to keep military aid to Ukraine frozen in a bid to coerce political favors.  The second day of President Trump\u2019s legal defense team\u2019s arguments is underway. Jay Sekulow, the President\u2019s private counsel, alluded to bombshell allegations over the weekend from former national security adviser John Bolton directly tying Ukraine aid to an investigation of the Bidens. But he suggested it would not be discussed by the team on Monday.\u00a0 \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done on Saturday is the pattern that we\u2019re going to continue today as far as how we\u2019re going to deal with the case. We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all,\u201d he said.  Sekulow said the team \u2014 including Judge Kenneth Starr, who led the investigation leading to President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment \u2014 would begin by laying out an overview of \u201chistorical and constitutional issues with impeachment proceedings.\u201d\u00a0 In his introductory remarks, Sekulow argued that Democrats conducted \u201ca pattern and practice of attempts over a three-year period to not only interfere with the President\u2019s ability to govern,\u201d which he called \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d  In a news conference ahead of today's impeachment proceedings, House Republicans provided a sense for how they are arguing away the latest developments involving former national security adviser John Bolton.\u00a0 \"Selective leaks designed to create a narrative that ultimately will change the conversation,\"\u00a0Rep. Mark Meadows said. \"Ultimately does not change the facts.\" Rep. Doug Collins went on to add that it is \"rerun of what we saw in the House.\" John Bolton is now \"assessing his options\" with regards to his forthcoming book, a source with knowledge of discussions over the book say. Bolton's book, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" was announced on Sunday night and listed\u00a0with a March 17 release date. Responding to criticism of his public silence during the impeachment probe, the source says \"Bolton submitted to the White House out of an abundance of caution and tried to follow the process.\" \"He was trying to do what he felt was the right thing and give the White House time to do a review,\" the source adds. But \"that process has been breached,\" the source says, referring to the details in Sunday night's New York Times story. So he is \"assessing his options.\" What happens next: Bolton is trying to decide what he wants to do \u2014 whether to speak out in some form, through Twitter or some other medium. While there have been no discussions about a TV interview, the source says, it is not out of the question either.\u00a0Bolton has repeatedly said that he will testify if subpoenaed.\u00a0 The publisher, Simon & Schuster, needs time to finish the production of the book and print physical copies. The publisher is currently planning on the March 17 date. But the book could theoretically be released sometime before March 17, at least in digital form, if the parties involved wanted it out sooner. The book currently ranks in the top 100 on Amazon's best selling books chart, and at around midday on Monday it was at No. 55. Trump impeachment lawyer Ken Starr is making his first comments on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial of President Trump. Starr \u2014 who was the prosecutor known for his work that led to\u00a0President Bill Clinton's impeachment\u00a0in the 1990s \u2014 mentioned that previous trial in his opening remarks as he described how the Senate is a court now. \"During the Clinton impeachment\u00a0trial 21 years ago in this\u00a0chamber, the Chief Justice of\u00a0the United States ruled in\u00a0response to the interjection that was interposed\u00a0by Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa.\u00a0'The senators are not sitting as\u00a0jurors,' Sen. Harkin noted,\" Starr said. He continued:  \"And the Chief Justice agreed\u00a0with that proposition.\u00a0Rather, the senate is a court.\u00a0In fact, history teaches us that\u00a0for literally decades, this body\u00a0was referred to in this context\u00a0as the high court of\u00a0impeachment.\u00a0So we're not in a legislative\u00a0chamber during these\u00a0proceedings. We're in a\u00a0tribunal. We're in court.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell kicked off the trial proceedings today by wishing Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts a happy birthday. McConnell joked: \"I'm sure this is exactly how you\u00a0planned to celebrate today.\" Roberts responded: \"Thank you very much for those\u00a0kind wishes, and thank you to\u00a0all the senators for not asking\u00a0for the yeas and nays.\"\u00a0 Senate chaplain Barry Black mentioned the death of Kobe Bryant, as well as the eight other victims of yesterday's helicopter crash, in his opening prayer,    \"As millions mourn the deaths of\u00a0Kobe and Gianna Bryant and those\u00a0who died with them, we think\u00a0about life's brevity,\u00a0uncertainty and legacy,\" he said.  \"Remind us that we all have a\u00a0limited time on Earth to leave\u00a0the world better than we found\u00a0it.\u00a0As this impeachment process\u00a0unfolds, give our senators the\u00a0desire to make the most of their\u00a0time on Earth,\" he added. Watch the chaplain's prayer: Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, says he was among the Republicans who fought to include in the resolution a vote on witnesses. He said \u201cI\u2019ll decide then at that time\u201d on witnesses.\u00a0 President Trump's legal team just resumed their opening arguments. They still have nearly 22 hours left to make their case. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said he's \"pleased\" some Republican senators have said they'd like to hear testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton, whose manuscript is at the center of impeachment news today. \"I am pleased that the senators\u00a0are reconsidering,\" Schiff told reporters. \"This witness obviously has such\u00a0relevant information to shed on\u00a0the most egregious of all of the\u00a0charges in the articles of\u00a0impeachment, and that is that\u00a0the President of the United\u00a0States withheld hundreds of\u00a0millions of dollars in military\u00a0aid from an ally at war to help\u00a0secure that nation's help to\u00a0cheat in the next election.\" Schiff added:  \"The news of the last 24 hours\u00a0that John Bolton not only is\u00a0prepared to testify but that\u00a0based on his manuscript, that\u00a0testimony would include a direct\u00a0conversation with the President\u00a0of the United States where the\u00a0President made it clear that he\u00a0was conditioning military aid on\u00a0political investigations or\u00a0material that he wanted from\u00a0Ukraine, makes it all the more\u00a0clear why you can't have a\u00a0trial, a meaningful trial,\u00a0without witnesses and you\u00a0certainly can't have one without\u00a0John Bolton.\" A source working with the President's legal team said Republican leaders are expected to argue against subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton. According to the source, the argument, which will be made at the Senate Republicans' closed conference lunch, will go like this: Whether John Bolton has relevant information has never been the primary focus. The focus has been on whether the Senate will \"agree to pick up the Democrats' abdicated responsibility\" by digging for evidence that did not support the articles of impeachment when they were drafted. The source acknowledged that the votes for witnesses may now be there, but said the process argument, which has gained traction among Senate Republicans, remains unchanged by Bolton's revelation. President Trump\u2019s impeachment team thought Sunday was going to be their last day to fine tune their final arguments for the Senate floor. They were confident, multiple people said, assured they could get Senate Republicans to a safe place to vote against witnesses and wrap up their client\u2019s trial by the end of the week. Then came John Bolton.\u00a0 The bombshell report in the New York Times sent the White House legal team working late into the night, as they realized it had the potential to change the trajectory of the trial. First and foremost, aides wanted Trump to address the book himself, and helped craft last night's late-night tweet to provide his allies with talking points for the day.\u00a0 Their next decision was whether to address the manuscript directly on the Senate floor today, according to a person briefed on the discussions. It became a major source of debate, with some advising it should be ignored while others said there's no way they couldn't talk about it.\u00a0 As of this morning, still no final decision had been made on that front. Initially, today was supposed to be the White House's last day of arguments. That's now up in the air, too.\u00a0 Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr were at the White House this weekend ahead of today's arguments on the Senate floor. This is notable because as of Friday, the two had still not been part of the formal legal prep for the president's defense. Both are expected to speak today.\u00a0Pat Cipollone, Jay Sekulow, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz take the Senate floor today at 1 p.m.\u00a0ET. Sen. Lindsey Graham said today that he wants to see former national security adviser John Bolton's manuscript. \u201cWhat we have to do here is evaluate the manuscript and see if it's a reason to add to the record,\u201d he said.  Asked if he would support a subpoena to get the manuscript, the South Carolina Republican said, \u201cI want to know what's in the manuscript, yeah, I think that\u2019s important.\u201d He said the manuscript could change his thinking on calling witnesses.\u00a0 \u201cIt could. I don\u2019t know yet. The White House said there was no direct evidence of communications, maybe this suggests that one person said there might be,\" he said. Graham emphasized that if Republicans do anything to call new documents or Bolton, they will also call the Bidens.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said all along is if you\u2019re going to add to the record, we\u2019re going to do it in a balanced way. So let\u2019s see what\u2019s in the manuscript, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s relevant, and if it is, then I\u2019ll make a decision about Bolton,\u201d said Graham. \u201cBut I promise you this\u2014 if we add to the record, then we\u2019re going to call Hunter Biden,\u00a0Joe Biden, all these other people.\u201d \u201cI have no idea how this happened,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know who leaked this. They say they didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not going to make a commitment about something I don\u2019t know.\u201d Remember: There's no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. President Trump\u2019s impeachment trial continues in Washington, but The Brief\u2019s Bianca Nobilo has been keeping track of the day\u2019s headlines outside Capitol Hill. \u00a0Here\u2019s what you need to know: Coronavirus: The Wuhan coronavirus is continuing to spread across China and the world. Beijing has placed nearly a dozen cities on full or partial lockdown in an attempt to stem the infection\u2019s spread. Nearly 60 million people have been affected by the restrictions. There are more than 50 confirmed cases of the infection outside mainland China, in 13 different locations.\nKobe Bryant: The world of sports is reeling after the NBA legend died yesterday in a helicopter crash. Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and 7 others were killed in the accident. Bryant won 5 NBA titles during a 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nBenjamin Netanyahu arrives in Washington: President Trump will meet with Israel\u2019s leader at the White House today. He will speak to Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s opposition leader Benny Gantz as the US prepares to unveil a Middle East peace plan.\nAuschwitz anniversary: Today is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp complex at Auschwitz. Survivors gathered at the site today to mark the event. Historians estimate that more than one million people, mostly Jews, were murdered at the camp. Watch more: Thom Tillis, a Republican senator up for re-election, said \u201cnot at this point\u201d when asked if the John Bolton report changes his views on witnesses.  Asked why he doesn\u2019t want to hear from Bolton, Tillis said:  \u201cSpend a little time on what you heard on Saturday and check back with me,\u201d a likely reference to the defense team's case. About Bolton's book: President Trump in August told Bolton that he wanted to continue holding military aid to Ukraine until the country helped with investigations into Democrats \u2014 including former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0\u2014 the New York Times reported Sunday,\u00a0citing multiple people's descriptions of an unpublished draft manuscript by Bolton. A source with direct knowledge of the manuscript told CNN the New York Times' telling of Bolton's account of the Ukraine aid hold discussion with Trump is accurate. President Trump says he hasn't seen a copy of his former national security adviser's forthcoming book. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he had not seen a manuscript of \"The Room Where it Happened.\" He was speaking ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The meeting is ongoing. GOP Sen. Mitt\u00a0Romney of Utah reiterated demands to call for John Bolton to testify, saying he\u2019s had discussions with some of his colleagues on the matter. He predicted that it's \"increasingly likely\" that there would be others who would join him. \"I think it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton, Romney said.\" The numbers: If all 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats vote for witnesses, at least four GOP senators would need to join them in order to pass a motion. Watch here: CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misquoted Romney. He said it is \"increasingly likely\u00a0that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton.\" Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, said \u201cthe reporting on John Bolton strengthens the case for witnesses and has prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues.\u201d \u201cI think fairness requires us to allow both sides to present their cases before we move to the issue of witnesses, and I've worked very hard to get language in the governing resolution that would ensure a vote on whether or not to call witnesses and subpoena other documents,\u201d she told a small group of reporters in the Capitol.  \u201cI\u2019ve also said from the beginning that it was very likely that I would vote for witness. And that has not changed,\" she added. Collins is one of three GOP senators who have signaled they could vote to allow witnesses at trial. If all 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats vote for witnesses, at least four GOP senators would need to join them in order to pass a motion. Collins' comments came shortly after she put out a short, similar statement on Twitter: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said former national security adviser John Bolton's manuscript is \"stunning.\" He called on Senate Republicans to vote to hear from witnesses, such as Bolton, at the trial.  \"Ambassador Bolton essentially\u00a0confirms the President committed\u00a0the offenses charged in the\u00a0first article of impeachment.\u00a0It boils down to one thing: We\u00a0have a witness with firsthand\u00a0evidence of the President's\u00a0actions for which he is on\u00a0trial. He is ready and willing to testify,\" he said. Schumer asked: \"How can Senate Republicans not\u00a0vote to call that witness and\u00a0request his documents?\" Schumer said GOP senators who claim \"the\u00a0House case lacks eyewitnesses\"\u00a0and then vote against hearing from witnesses are \"talking out of both sides of\u00a0their mouth.\" Watch here: Chief Justice John Roberts appeared briefly on the Supreme Court bench today, his 65th birthday, to swear in a roomful of military lawyers to the Supreme Court bar. Roberts was joined by five other members of the court.\u00a0 \u00a0Earlier in the morning,\u00a0the Supreme Court had issued an orders list, but did not act on big pending issues including religious liberty, LGBT rights, the Second Amendment and immigration.  Roberts is due at the Senate, to preside over the impeachment trial, at 1 p.m. ET. The justices are now on recess: They are expected back at court on Feb. 21 for a closed door conference and then arguments and potential\u00a0opinions the week of Feb. 24.\u00a0 It seems the impeachment may have slowed down the release of opinions. Last year at this time the court had issued eight, this term they\u2019ve only issued four.\u00a0 Even though the justices are on recess from the bench, they will still respond to emergency orders and accept petitions. We could get an order on the Trump administration\u2019s public charge rule as early as today, as well as the Trump\u00a0filing on the president\u2019s bid to keep his financial documents shielded from release.\u00a0 House Democratic aides say they are focused on the Senate trial and getting former national security adviser John Bolton to testify there. They refused to say what their strategy is for Bolton if he doesn\u2019t appear before the Senate.\u00a0 Democratic aides would not discuss whether they are preparing to seek Bolton\u2019s testimony in the House in light of the revelations in his draft book manuscript that the President connected withholding US aid to investigating the Bidens, declining to discuss any efforts to obtain Bolton\u2019s testimony or his notes beyond saying the Senate should subpoena them. \u201cThe appropriate place for John Bolton to testify is in that trial in the Senate,\u201d one aide said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the focus is, that\u2019s where he should testify, and that\u2019s what we are planning on.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 House impeachment manager Adam Schiff told CNN this morning that he is more interested in John Bolton\u2019s notetaking than Bolton\u2019s book manuscript. \u201cThese notes took place while the events were happening, while they were fresh in his mind. Those in many respects are more important than the manuscript,\" he said. A reminder: John Bolton was widely known as a diligent notetaker during his time at the National Security Council, multiple people told CNN. Bolton was frequently seen clutching a yellow legal pad around the White House, which he also took to meetings. \u201cThese notes took place while the events were happening, while they were fresh in his mind,\" Schiff said. \"Those in many respects are more important than the manuscript. So we ought to not only have John Bolton testify but we ought to see what he wrote down in his notes at the time.\" Former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s upcoming book blindsided senior White House officials and GOP senators who now want to know more about Bolton\u2019s side of the story as laid out in his manuscript, multiple sources close\u00a0to the process told CNN. GOP senators may now be open to the idea of Bolton testifying in a classified setting, Republican sources close to the process said.  Others may want to learn more about the manuscript, those sources said, with one GOP official noting Bolton has more credibility than Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. Still, another official stated the obvious: Bolton is selling a book. Bolton\u2019s book also took top aides by surprise at the White House, two senior officials said. Another source familiar with conversations ongoing since the Bolton news broke told CNN that the White House is hearing from Republican senators who are frustrated that at least someone in the White House had the Bolton manuscript since the end of December and they were kept in the dark. The question is what to do about it. Seeking more information from Bolton could prolong the trial, Republican sources said, something Majority Leader McConnell doesn\u2019t want. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and former Senate Majority Whip, downplayed the significance of former national security adviser John Bolton's revelation that Trump wanted to continue holding military aid to Ukraine until the country helped with investigations into Democrats.  Cornyn said the timing around this was suspicious and accused Democrats of having a \"credibility problem.\" When pressed by CNN's Suzanne Malveaux that Bolton's manuscript is inconsistent with what the White House defense team has been saying, Cornyn disagreed.\u00a0 \"I\u00a0don't think so because they said the aid did flow and the investigation never occurred so really we are talking about events that never happened,\" he said.\u00a0 Chief Justice\u00a0John Roberts, who has been\u00a0presiding over\u00a0the Senate\u00a0impeachment trial, is celebrating his 65th\u00a0birthday today. He's expected to preside over the trial when the Senate reconvenes at 1 p.m. ET. The National Security Council said in a statement this morning that former national security adviser John Bolton's manuscript is under \"initial review,\" and that no White House personnel outside the NSC have reviewed it.\u00a0 Here's the statement statement from National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot: \u201cAmbassador Bolton\u2019s manuscript was submitted to the NSC for pre-publication review and has been under initial review by the NSC.\u00a0No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript.\u201d\u00a0 President Trump's legal team will continue giving their opening arguments when the Senate impeachment trial resumes this afternoon. Here's what we're watching today: 11 a.m. ET: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will hold a news conference.\n11:30 a.m. and noon ET: There will be closed-door Senate lunches.\n1 p.m. ET: The US Senate gavels into session for the Senate impeachment trial. Lead House impeachment manger Rep. Adam Schiff told CNN that former national security adviser John Bolton's revelation that President Trump directly tied investigations into political opponents to the hold on Ukraine military aid undercuts the President's defense.\u00a0 \"It completely blasts another hole in the President's defense,\" Schiff said this morning on CNN's \"New Day.\" Schiff also said the new allegation means that Senators are \"hard pressed\" not to hear more from Bolton.\u00a0 \"The question is, are the\u00a0senators willing to her the\u00a0truth?\" Schiff said.\u00a0 Schiff added:  \"This is the reason John Bolton has offered to testify in the Senate. He's got a book coming out in March. He also does not want to be in a position of withholding this information until his book comes out ... Now, that's not an excuse, frankly, for his failure to testify in the house. He should have come to the house. He should not have threatened to sue us if we subpoenaed him.\" What this is all about: Trump in August told Bolton that he wanted to continue holding military aid to Ukraine until the country helped with investigations into Democrats \u2014 including former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0\u2014 the New York Times reported Sunday,\u00a0citing multiple people's descriptions of an unpublished draft manuscript by Bolton. A source with direct knowledge of the manuscript told CNN the New York Times' telling of Bolton's account of the Ukraine aid hold discussion with Trump is accurate. Call it the October surprise\u00a0of\u00a0President Trump\u2019s impeachment trial.\u00a0 John Bolton, the former national security adviser who has been\u00a0playing his own personal game\u00a0of\u00a0footsie with impeachment negotiators for months, has written in a draft book manuscript that the President did, in fact, condition US security assistance to Ukraine on investigations into a political rival.  He represents a first-hand witness. He represents direct knowledge. He represents everything the White House defense team said in their Saturday presentation on the Senate floor\u00a0didn't exist.\u00a0 Here's the bottom line: 24 hours ago, the impeachment trial was on track to be wrapped up by Friday or Saturday\u00a0of\u00a0this week. A vote to move to consider witnesses was short\u00a0of\u00a0GOP votes and how quick Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could move to the vote to acquit had become the central question in GOP circles.  For the moment, all\u00a0of\u00a0that is scrambled and extremely fluid. Could it still end up that way? Yes. But GOP senators have an awful lot more on their mind as the White House defense team continues its presentation today.\u00a0 White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham just appeared on Fox News and gave her first reaction to the New York Times report on former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s book.  She questioned the timing of the report and repeated multiple times it is \u201cnot true.\u201d Grisham also said she didn\u2019t know if the National Security Council had many any edits to Bolton\u2019s book, but added:  \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if they have done anything if they have made any edits yet for the national security and if there\u2019s any classified information out there. But if there is, that\u2019s very, very dangerous precedent to set once again.\u201d Some background: The New York Times report said Trump in August told Bolton that he wanted to continue holding military aid to Ukraine until the country helped with investigations into Democrats \u2014 including former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden. The report cited multiple people's descriptions of an unpublished draft manuscript by Bolton. White House counsel spent just two hours on Saturday \u2014 their first of three days for opening arguments \u2014 arguing the President's case. Compare that to the Democratic House managers, who spoke for around eight hours during their first day of arguments. \"You've heard the House managers\u00a0speak for nearly 24 hours over\u00a0three days.\u00a0We don't anticipate using that\u00a0much time,\" White House counsel Pat Cipollone said at the start of the day. \"We don't believe that they have\u00a0come anywhere close to meeting\u00a0their burden for what they're\u00a0asking you to do,\" he said. Trump's defense team used just under two hours of their time on Saturday morning. They have about 22 hours left to argue their case. During the presentation from House managers Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said he spoke with President Trump after one of the proceedings this week and he gave him his thoughts about them so far. Graham, an ally of the President, said Trump thought Democratic House manager Adam Schiff \"did a bad job.\" But Graham said he told Trump that\u00a0Schiff did a \"pretty good job.\" He added that Trump was \"bored\" by the proceedings. President Trump in August told his then-national security adviser John Bolton that he wanted to continue holding military aid to Ukraine until the country helped with investigations into Democrats \u2014 including former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0\u2014 the New York Times reported Sunday,\u00a0citing multiple people's descriptions of an unpublished draft manuscript by Bolton. A source with direct knowledge of the manuscript told CNN the New York Times' telling of Bolton's account of the Ukraine aid hold discussion with Trump is accurate. Trump's purported statement, as described by Bolton, would directly tie the US military aid freeze with the President's requests that Ukraine announce investigations into his political rivals \u2014 undermining a key pillar of the President's impeachment defense that the two circumstances are unrelated. Remember: There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son, Hunter Biden, in Ukraine, and Joe Biden has repeatedly defended his son and himself. What this news could mean for the impeachment trial: Such a revelation would bolster Democratic claims that Trump abused a public trust and taxpayer cash to try to leverage a foreign government's help in the 2020 election against one of his possible top opponents. It would also undermine a key rationale of his defense team's argument that there were other reasons Trump withheld aid \u2013 including his concern over corruption \u2014 a claim challenged by substantial previous evidence."], "Language": false}
