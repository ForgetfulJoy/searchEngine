In keeping with his annual tradition, the former president shared a list of his favorite books from 2019 on social media over the weekend.  The list features 19 picks from various genres, including novels, collections of stories and essays, histories, biographies and more. Obama also reminded his followers of 19 other book recommendations that he called out earlier in the year. Most of the books on the list were released in 2019, though some of them are older works that Obama discovered this year. He also shared his lists of favorite movies and music from 2019.  \"This has become a fun little tradition for me, and I hope it is for you, too,\" Obama wrote on Instagram in addition to posting the list. \"Because while each of us has plenty that keeps us busy \u2014 work and family life, social and volunteer commitments \u2014 outlets like literature and art can enhance our day-to-day experiences. They're the fabric that helps make up a life \u2014 the album that lifts us up after a long day, the dog-eared paperback we grab off the shelf to give to a friend, the movie that makes us think and feel in a new way, works that simply help us escape for a bit.\" See below to shop all of Obama's top picks, and start clearing out some space on your bookshelf:  \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: the Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power\" by Shoshana Zuboff ($26.69; amazon.com)\n\"The Anarchy: The East India Company, Corporate Violence, and the Pillage of an Empire\" by William Dalrymple ($23.67; amazon.com)\n\"Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee\" by Casey Cep ($16.79; amazon.com)\n\"Girl, Woman, Other\" by Bernardine Evaristo ($12.79; amazon.com)\n\"The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present\" by David Treuer ($15.30; amazon.com)\n\"How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy\" by Jenny Odell ($18.29; amazon.com)\n\"Lost Children Archive\" by Valeria Luiselli ($19.98; amazon.com)\n\"Lot: Stories\" by Bryan Washington ($15.81; amazon.com)\n\"Normal People\" by Sally Rooney ($14.56; amazon.com)\n\"The Orphan Master's Son\" by Adam Johnson ($9.79; amazon.com)\n\"The Yellow House\" by Sarah M.
