According to an order signed by Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, court rules will be relaxed so that 2020 graduates who haven\u2019t completed the bar exam can practice under supervision of an attorney in good standing with a three-year license. \"At this challenging time, the public has a continuing and growing need for legal services in many critical areas,\" Rabner stated in the order Monday. \u201cNewly admitted lawyers can help meet that need.\u201d The graduates must apply to take the first exam scheduled after graduation, or qualify for an extension, and must also earn certification from the Supreme Court Committee on Character before they can practice.

Tony Evers has asked FEMA to begin the development of a second alternative care facility to prepare for a potential surge in Covid-19 cases, Evers said in a statement. The facility would be housed in the Alliant Energy Center, a large\u00a0multi-venue complex in Madison.\u00a0 \"Dane County is proud to partner with Governor Evers and make our facility available to the state,\" says\u00a0Dane County Executive Joe Parisi, who oversees the space. \"This second alternative care facility will be an essential backup facility to ensure our healthcare system in the south central region is not overwhelmed,\" Evers said. \"Hopefully this second site will not be needed, but we must prepare for it now so we are ready.\"  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected the resignation submitted by Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu after the minister came under heavy criticism for his implementation of a surprise lockdown in Turkey. In a written statement about his resignation, Soylu said the scenes created after the lockdown announcement did not fit into the \"perfectly managed process\" by the government against the spread of\u00a0Covid-19. After the announcement of the curfew, people rushed out to markets to stock up on goods before the start of the lockdown leading to close contact between people. In his statement, Soylu took near complete blame for the chaos and asked for \"forgiveness from my dear nation, which I have never wanted to harm, and my president to whom\u00a0I will be loyal till the end of my life.\" The responsibility for the implementation of the decision for the weekend belongs to me in all aspects,\" he said in the written statement. The offer of resignation was submitted to the president and was rejected, according to a written statement by the Turkish presidency.  \"The decision to offer a resignation rests with the office holder but to accept it is the decision of the President. The resignation has not been accepted and the minister will continue his post,\" the statement said.  The statement praised Soylu's past performance across a wide range of policy issues as well as more recently on the Covid-19 measures. Soylu has been a pivotal figure in Turkey\u2019s fight against terrorism and is known as a nationalist hardliner.\u00a0 As he promised, Idaho rancher Ammon Bundy \u2013 who once led an armed occupation of federal land in Oregon \u2013 organized an Easter Sunday church service in violation of a statewide order on mass gatherings.

Americans don't in fear. They don't give up their rights.\" Bundy did not officially announce the venue for the service until just hours before it started.\u00a0He told CNN last week he wasn\u2019t concerned about getting coronavirus. \"I'm healthy, my family is healthy. I'd rather have it now so my body is immune to it,\" Bundy said. ##Daily Life## New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu helped unload a FedEx cargo plane containing nearly 7 million pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) Sunday to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \"Today is truly a jumping off point for the state and the healthcare facilities and individuals who can start benefiting from getting this PPE,\" Sununu said. \"We're going to get it out the door as fast as we can in a variety of different areas.\" The governor said some of the equipment will be shared with neighboring states.  \"Whether Vermont or Maine, we'll find out what their need is and be part of the solution as well,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0 The state won't be charging those that receive today's shipment of supplies, a news release from the governor's office said. ##Health## The Ontario government is developing a new health data platform called the Pandemic Threat Response (PANTHR) that hopes to better detect, plan and respond to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a news release from the Ontario government.  The PANTHR platform is expected to hold secure health data that will allow researchers to better support health system planning and responsiveness, including the immediate need to analyze the coronavirus outbreak. \"Better access to integrated data will improve modelling and research to determine how Covid-19 is evolving, ensuring frontline staff are as prepared as possible in these unprecedented times,\" said Christine Elliott, Ontario's deputy premier and health minister. The new platform will  contain clinical data from special registry collections and clinical data extracted from public health, hospital, laboratory and diagnostic imaging information systems. ##Health## Ruben Burks, the first African American secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers, died Monday due to coronavirus, his grandson confirmed to CNN.  He was 86. Born in Louisiana, Burks moved to Michigan in 1955 to work in a General Motors factory. He joined the local union and worked his way up, eventually reaching the UAW\u2019s second-highest position, according to the union. Over more than 60 years of union activism, Burks championed the work of women and people of color in the labor movement. At the end of the day, he was truly a giving man,\" said his grandson Tony Burks, who was raised by his grandfather. \"His real focus was on community and making sure everyone had an opportunity to be their best self.\" Burks was remembered by as a larger-than-life community leader in Flint, dedicated to social justice and the working class. Even in retirement, Burks organized fellow retirees to protest water conditions in Flint, longtime friend and fellow union leader Steve Dawes told CNN. \"There wasn\u2019t a week that went by that Ruben didn\u2019t call me to ask how things were going, and how he could help,\" Dawes said. Burks' local union chapter renamed its hall after him, and the regional UAW women\u2019s council recognized him with a line of scholarships in his name. Known for his constant thumbs-up, he encouraged his large family to face difficult situations with positivity and enthusiasm. Now his family is applying that same attitude to planning his funeral arrangements, Tony Burks said. \"It\u2019s hard right now with regards to the timing, but we are working together to putting together a celebration,\" Tony Burks said. \"In living up with his true mission, no matter what you\u2019re faced with, do the best with it.\" ##Daily Life## Illinois now has 20,852 cases of coronavirus with 720 deaths from the virus, according to a statement released by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

Emergency officials say sheltering from tornadoes and protecting yourself from severe weather takes priority over social distancing guidelines Americans are adhering to during the coronavirus pandemic. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency tweeted a photo saying their experts were monitoring the weather. The tweet also emphasized that people should have a safe place to go \u2013\u2013 and if that's a public shelter, to continue practicing social distancing. \"If you go to a public shelter please wear a mask, bandana, or scarf around your nose and mouth,\" the tweet said. Oktibbeha County's Emergency Management in Mississippi tweeted a photo with information about procedures people should follow when they get to a safe room. \"Upon arrival, be prepared to sanitize your shoes and your hands,\" the tweet reads. \"Everyone is required to wear some type of face covering such as: mask, face shield, bandana, etc.,\" the tweet from Oktibbeha County said.

Life-Safety will always be our priority.\" Louisiana is also in the path of severe weather. The Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness said people should revise their emergency plans to account for lifestyle changes in the midst of coronavirus shelter-in-place orders, according to a statement this morning. \"Many of you may be living in different conditions as we continue to fight the spread of coronavirus. That may mean adjustments to your emergency plans. Consider any potential changes needed before the severe weather hits,\" the statement said. \"Use the time you have now to prepare.\" Whether shelters will remain open despite the pandemic is up to city and county governments. Closures and updates on the weather can be found on official social media accounts, government websites or by contacting local emergency management agencies. ##Health## ##Daily Life## There are 585 sailors\u00a0from the USS Theodore Roosevelt who have tested positive for coronavirus\u00a0as of Sunday,\u00a0according to a statement from the US Navy.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Sunday defended his decision not to issue a statewide stay-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying that his \"targeted approach\" has proven to be effective. \"If we need to do more, we will do more,\" the Republican governor told CNN. \"So that's always an option on the table if we have to shelter in place. But right now, what we're doing proves to be successful, this targeted approach.\" Arkansas is one of a handful of GOP-led states that has not issued stay-at-home orders for its residents, which the majority of US states have implemented to slow the spread of coronavirus. Hutchinson said he does not believe Arkansas needs to issue a statewide order because of its low density in population. He pointed to his actions in declaring a public emergency when Arkansas had its first confirmed case of coronavirus, closing the state's schools and increasing testing. \"We have masks and social distancing and the people of Arkansas have embraced that. That gives you success,\" Hutchinson said, adding later, \"We want to take the long-term approach to this and you're not going to win simply by a lockdown.\" ##Daily Life## ##Health## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said everything, from business to schools, was closed regionally \"and that\u2019s how we will go forward together\" as the state looks at when and how the economy could reopen. This comes after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced yesterday that public schools in the city would remain closed for the rest of the academic year. A few hours later, Cuomo said no decision had been made yet. At a press conference Sunday, Cuomo was asked about his working relationship with de Blasio. He said he understood the mayor's stance and that it's \"not an unreasonable position.\" He added that unlike de Blasio, he has to worry about other counties and neighboring states when making decisions and said coordination with Connecticut and New Jersey would be optimal. \"We won\u2019t open schools one minute sooner than they should be open,\u00a0but we won\u2019t open schools one minute later than they should be open either,\" Cuomo said. \"Whatever plan we come up with will be driven by data and science.\" Cuomo explained it is important to open business at the same time as schools because schools act in part as child care so parents can go to work. He added opening both at the same time is also critical for restarting the economy.  \"If you say the schools are closed through June, you are effectively saying businesses are closed through June because you can\u2019t \u2013\u2013 restart the economy fully without restarting schools,\" Cuomo said. ##Daily Life## Former President Barack Obama\u00a0wished the nation a \"joyful\" Easter Sunday, while remarking on the dramatic differences in celebrating this year due to\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic. \"Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope \u2014 a reminder of rebirth and renewal \u2014 and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter,\" the former president wrote on Twitter. Due to the pandemic, US officials have recommended social distancing and urged Americans not to attend services larger than 10 people \u2014\u00a0leaving churches empty\u00a0and congregations to celebrate online. Read Obama's tweet: Dr. Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said Sunday on CBS that if the social distancing measures and closures were relaxed May 1, the country would see a rebound of coronavirus cases. \"We don\u2019t think the capability in the states exists yet to deal with that volume of cases and so by July or August we could be back in the same situation we are in now\u201d if there was premature opening of the country, Murray said.\u00a0 Murray noted states on the West Coast that are father along in the pandemic will still need \u201cweeks of closures\u201d beyond the peak for the opportunity to conduct proper testing and contact tracing.\u00a0 Citing Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s statements on CNN that some states would open up in mid-May, relaxing closures and social distancing measures on a rolling basis poses a new set of questions that have not been addressed, Murray said.\u00a0 \u201cOf course there\u2019s a big issue of states are on different timings of their epidemics, which we know is the case. How are they going to control importation from other states into their state,\" Murray added. He also pointed out the inconsistent state mitigation policies have also been a problem for the modeling of this pandemic.  \u201cWe're now in the last series of forecasts being around 60-61,000 deaths. We predicted the peak about now, and that seems to be occurring at the national level, but because of incomplete implementation of social distancing closures in many states is adding a degree of uncertainty,\" he said. China has imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research on the origins of the\u00a0novel coronavirus, according to a central government directive and\u00a0online notices\u00a0published by two Chinese universities, that have since been removed from the web. Under the new policy, all academic papers on Covid-19 will be subject to extra vetting before being submitted for publication. Studies on the origin of the virus will receive extra scrutiny and must be approved by central government officials, according to the now-deleted posts. A medical expert in Hong Kong who collaborated with mainland researchers to publish a clinical analysis of Covid-19 cases in an international medical journal said his work did not undergo such vetting in February. Some context: The increased scrutiny appears to be the latest effort by the Chinese government to control the narrative on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which has\u00a0claimed more than 100,000 lives and sickened 1.7 million people\u00a0worldwide since it first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December. Read more here. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will not be able to reopen effectively after the coronavirus pandemic without help from the federal government. \"Without federal assistance,\u00a0how does this state economy come\u00a0back?\u00a0How do we really start to fund\u00a0schools,\" he said at a press conference Sunday. \"That has\u00a0to happen from a federal level.\" Cuomo said New York currently has a $10\u00a0billion to $15 billion\u00a0deficit due to spending aimed at fighting the virus. \"Nobody wants to pick between a public health strategy and an economic strategy, and as governor of this state, I'm not going to pick one over the other,\" he said. \"We need a public health strategy that is safe, that is consistent with an economic strategy.\" Cuomo said he signed a join statement with Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association, calling for $500 billion\u00a0in funding for state\u00a0governments. Cuomo went on to say some states are getting $300,000 for each coronavirus case and New York is only getting about $12,000 per case.\u00a0 The governor also said he will work on a reopening plan with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont. \"We need a strategy that coordinates business and schools and transportation and workforce,\" Cuomo said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is signing an executive order to expand the number of people who are eligible to conduct the coronavirus antibody test. This test will determine if someone had and got over the virus, Cuomo said, and would determine if the person theoretically has immunity to the virus for an undetermined period of time. \u201cThat is an important test, and we have to get that test to scale, and this executive order will help do that,\" Cuomo said. The governor is also signing an executive order directing all employers to provide essential workers with a cloth or surgical face mask when they are interacting with the public. The masks should be provided cost free, Cuomo said. There are roughly 758 people in New York who have died in a 24-hour period across the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this morning. This is \u201cterrible\u201d news, Cuomo said. A total of 9,385 people have died from Covid-19 across the state, the governor added. Cuomo said there continues to be a flattening in the number of lives lost \u201cat a terribly high rate.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the one number that look forward to seeing drop as soon as I open my eyes in the morning,\u201d he said. He said \u201cin the context of 9/11 which was supposed to be the tragedy of my life time,\u201d 2,753 lives were lost then, and the state is now at 9,385 lives lost due to the virus. He referenced this \u201cdistorted\u201d holiday time with the closure of temples and churches and in the context of the holy season, this continues to be \u201ctruly tragic news.\u201d The governor noted that these aren\u2019t just numbers, but people, and every family who has experienced loss is in \u201cour thoughts and prayers.\u201d \u201cNew Yorkers did everything humanly possible to be there for their loved ones and try to save those lives,\" Cuomo said. The total number of coronavirus hospitalizations are down to 53 across the state, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. This is the lowest number since the pandemic started, Cuomo said today during a press conference. There are roughly 18,707 people who have been hospitalized so far in New York. ICU admissions are now at 189, Cuomo said. The United Kingdom's coronavirus death toll is another reminder of how serious the situation is and why everyone needs to continue following social distancing rules, the country\u2019s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. \u201cToday marks as somber day in the impact of this disease as we join the list of countries that have seen more than 10,000 deaths related to coronavirus,\u201d Hancock said at the daily coronavirus update. \u201cThe fact that over 10,000 people have lost their lives to this invisible killer demonstrates just how serious coronavirus is and why the national effort that everyone is engaged in is so important.\u201d Hancock said that despite the growing death toll, the UK health system has not been overwhelmed by the number of patients. He said there are currently 2,295 spare critical care beds. \u201cThere is more spare capacity for critical care than when coronavirus hit our shores,\u201d Hancock said. There are now 9,775 ventilators and \u201crecord amounts\u201d of personal protective equipment available in the system for health workers, Hancock added. Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN that he \u201ccan\u2019t guarantee\u201d that it will be safe for people to vote in person during the general presidential election in November. \u201cI believe that, if we have a good measured way of rolling into this, steps towards normality, that we hope, by the time we get to November, that we will be able to do it in a way which is the standard way,\u201d Fauci said. Fauci, the top infectious disease doctor in the US, added that he doesn\u2019t want to be a \u201cpessimistic person\u201d but \u201cthere is always the possibility\u2026 as we get into next fall, and the beginning of early winter, that we could see a rebound.\u201d Another 737 people have died from coronavirus in the United Kingdom, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 10,612 according to new figures from the Department of Health and Social Care. These figures are current as of 5 p.m. (12 p.m. ET) April 11. The update shows that 84,279 people have tested positive since the outbreak began. Read a tweet from the department: United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he finds it hard to find the words to thank those who saved his life, saying \u201cthings could have gone either way\u201d while he was in hospital. Johnson was discharged from hospital on Sunday after being treated for coronavirus, including three nights in intensive care. \u201cI have today left hospital after a week in which the NHS has saved my life, no question,\u201d Johnson said in a video released online. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find the words to express my debt.\u201d He said health care worker's courage and devotion stood out. \u201cI have seen the personal courage not just of the doctors and nurses but of everyone, the cleaners, the cooks, the health care workers of every description \u2014 physios, radiographers, pharmacists \u2014 who have kept coming to work, kept putting themselves in harm\u2019s way, kept risking this deadly virus,\" Johnson said. Johnson used the message to personally name some of the health care workers who looked after him, including two nurses \u2013 one from New Zealand and one from Portugal \u2013 who stood by his bedside. Johnson will now spend some time recovering at the prime minister\u2019s countryside retreat. Watch the address on Twitter: Dr. David Nabarro, the World Health Organization\u2019s special envoy on Covid-19, warned that the virus will not necessarily come in waves like influenza.  In an interview on NBC, Nabarro said the WHO thinks \u201cit is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come,\u201d until a vaccine is developed.  Moving forward, he said there will be small outbreaks \u201csporadically,\u201d and it is crucial that every community has a \u201cdefense shield\u201d to isolate cases and prevent a large outbreak. When asked if the world\u2019s curve of coronavirus cases is flattening, Nabarro said that although there are signs of the flattening the curve in Europe and the US, the WHO is \u201cstill very worried and still very much on high alert,\u201d particularly for countries with weaker health systems. Nabarro emphasized the global nature of the coronavirus problem, and called for greater cooperation between world leaders, saying, \u201cI would like leaders to be a little more cooperative, yes please.\u201d Some context: President Trump last week accused the WHO of not confronting the virus aggressively enough in its early stages, being too friendly towards China in its work and said there would have been fewer deaths if the organization had given \u201ccorrect analysis.\u201d Nabarro defended the WHO saying it must work with the information it is given by governments, and that \u201cwe believe what we\u2019ve got, we work with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d  He also mentioned how China allowed the WHO to investigate inside the country in February, and there were no restrictions placed on the team there, which included some American doctors, he noted. Nabarro further said that he \u201cloves\u201d the WHO\u2019s partnership with the United States, and that the director of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has spoken directly with Trump. New Jersey's governor said the peak of the state's coronavirus cases could still be ahead. Phil Murphy spoke to CNN this morning, saying some studies project that the state is in its peak, while a more \"sobering reality\" has New Jersey peaking many weeks from now, and in higher numbers.\u00a0 Murphy emphasized that the recovery of health care workers takes priority over economic recovery.  \"I fear if we open too early without making that recovery we could be pouring gas on the fire,\" Murphy said. The governor said he's working with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to agree on a regional testing strategy.  \"Not only did we bring our states to a closure together in harmony, but when we re-open we're doing so in broad harmony as well,\" Murphy said. \"Including testing and other healthcare infrastructure that we'll need to make sure we don't see another round two of this.\" Starting Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is requiring all city workers who come in contact with the public while on duty to wear face coverings. De Blasio said the city has already provided 1.4 million face coverings to city workers and will provide more as necessary.\u00a0 Addressing the economic hardship that the city is facing, New York City is establishing a new initiative to hire New Yorkers to do \u201cabsolutely crucial and heroic work in our hospital systems,\u201d and that will be expanded to voluntary and independent hospitals as well, the mayor said. To all New Yorkers looking for work, de Blasio said, \u201cjoin a team of heroes.\u201d New York City Health & Hospital will be hiring 500 non-clinical staff for roles like patient transport, clerical staff and cleaning staff. These will be temporary jobs beginning with a 90 day assignment, the mayor added. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wants to have community testing for coronavirus available by the end of next week. De Blasio said at a press conference Sunday he will be asking for 110,000 individualized tests from the federal government to make this a reality while setting up new testing centers in targeted communities. By the end of next week, de Blasio intends to set up Health and Hospitals testing centers in East New York, Brooklyn; Morrisania Bronx; Harlem, New York; Jamaica, Queens\u00a0and Clifton, Staten Island. This push for widespread community testing is part of \"phase two,\" de Blasio said. He said communities of color, lower income communities, immigrant communities, and vulnerable \u201cfolks who haven\u2019t had the healthcare they needed and deserved throughout their life\u201d have been impacted. \u201cWe cannot accept this inequality we have to attack it with every tool we have,\" de Blasio said. These new testing centers also provide an opportunity to put some people back to work. De Blasio said the new sites, as well as public hospitals, and eventually private and voluntary systems, are hiring temporary, non-clinical staff. These will include things like helping to transport patients, cleaning and maintenance of facilities. \"I want to do everything I can to give people back their livelihood,\" de Blasio said. Dr. Anthony Fauci said some lives would have been saved if mitigation efforts to control the coronavirus pandemic had been instituted earlier.  Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious doctor, was responding to a question after reports that he and other federal health officials were recommending mitigation efforts like social distancing to President Trump as early as mid-February. \u201cI mean, obviously you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,\u201d Fauci told CNN this morning. \u201cObviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decision is complicated. But you\u2019re right, I mean obviously, if we had right from the very beginning shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.\u201d When asked why the President didn\u2019t recommend social distancing guidelines until mid-March \u2013 about three weeks after the nation\u2019s top health experts wanted to recommend they be put in place \u2013 Fauci said, \u201cWe look at it from a pure health standpoint. We make a recommendation. Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes it\u2019s not. But we \u2013 it is what it is.\u00a0We are where we are right now.\u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said \u201cbased on everything we know\u201d the city will have enough ventilators to get through this coming week. The rate of increase this past week in ventilator use has slowed with an average of 70 more intubations daily, down from 200 to 300, the mayor said. De Blasio said he thought this week was going to be \u201cmuch worse,\" saying it was a \u201cdifferent\u201d week than the one expected. Once this crisis hit he said the city went into a \u201ccrisis standard.\" Based on this standard, the city will have N95 surgical masks and gloves for the week ahead. He said, however, there will be barely enough face shields and surgical gowns for the week ahead, said de Blasio. \u00a0\u201cNo one can tell you truthfully that were providing what would be the peace time standard \u2013 true abundance of PPEs of every kind that can be used once and thrown away, we would love to be in that situation,\" de Blasio said. \u201cWere not in that situation over these last weeks\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo started his Easter morning by returning ventilators to the Pathways Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Niskayuna, New York. The governor said earlier in the coronavirus crisis, the state needed ventilators and at least 35 of them came from an unexpected place, the nursing home. Cuomo went on to thank the nursing home for its generosity during a rough time and proceed to walk up to the window of the nursing home to put his hand on the glass. You could hear Cuomo in the background saying, \u201cin my heart, you made a difference.\u201d \"When things are at their worse sometimes people are at their best,\" Cuomo said. By the numbers: New York now has 181,825 confirmed coronavirus cases and 8,650 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Cuomo said at a press conference Saturday morning that while the curve is beginning to flatten and the hospitalization rate is down, there is still a high number of people getting infected. Citing numbers from the New York metropolitan area, Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN he has \"cautious optimism\" the nation may be seeing a decrease in the rate of hospital admissions, patients admitted to intensive care and those needing intubation \u2013 resulting in the curve of cases decreasing. Fauci did say the nation is still seeing some hot spots in various locations.\u00a0 White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx had said Friday officials believed the nation had its peak, but more data was needed to confirm the status.  \u201cIf you look at the pattern of the curves in other countries, once you turn that corner, hopefully you\u2019ll see a very sharp decline. And then you start thinking about how we can keep it that way and prevent it from resurging,\u201d Fauci said. As the President debates when to recommend the guidelines instituted by governors across the nation should be relaxed,\u00a0Fauci told CNN there has to be a \u201cgradual re-entry\u201d or a \u201crolling re-entry.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re trying to balance two things: you wanna make sure you don\u2019t do something prematurely and precipitously, at the same time you pay attention to the need to get back to normal,\u201d he said.  Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious expert, added the nation cannot at one time drop the various restrictions put in place or there is an \u201cextraordinary risk\u201d of another major outbreak. He said different parts of the country will have to do it in different ways, partly depending on whether those locations have seen major outbreaks already or are facing future ones. The top infectious disease doctor in the US says reopening the country will be a gradual process and restrictions will be lifted depending on where you are in the country. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN this is not a \"one size fits all\" decision. \"It is not going to be a light switch that we say, okay, it is now June, July or whatever, click, the light switch goes back on,\" Fauci said. \"It's going to be depending where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak that you have already experienced and the threat of an outbreak that you may not have experienced.\" Fauci said he believes this approach is needed to try to prevent a \"rebound\" or second wave of coronavirus cases. He said there will be people who do get infected after restrictions are loosened, but by reopening gradually, there will be time to identify those cases and isolate them. \"If you start, and when\u00a0one starts, to relax some of the\u00a0restrictions, we know that there\u00a0will be people who will be\u00a0getting infected.\u00a0I mean, that is just reality,\" Fauci said. Fauci said \"it's so difficult to make those kinds of predictions\" regarding when these measures will begin, but he hopes to reassess the situation at the end of April. \"We are hoping that at the end of the month, we can look around and say, okay, is there any element here that we can safely and cautiously start pulling back on? If so, do it. If not, then just continue to hunker down,\" he said. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte says this Easter is like none other because of the coronavirus outbreak. Conte shared his sympathy to those affected by the crisis in an Easter message on Facebook. \u201cTo those who suffer today, to those who have an empty chair in front of them, to those who struggle in the hospital wards to remove tears and pain from their community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe miss the smiles of relatives, the hugs of friends, the beautiful traditions of our country, the handshakes in the church, in the square, at the bar. The sacrifices that each of us makes on this important Sunday are a gesture of authentic commitment to what really matters and that we will be able to recover soon,\" Conte added. He said that while this Easter is different, we will get through this together. \u201cToday will not be like the other times, and tomorrow won\u2019t be either, when we hold on to what we care about. Together we will do it,\" Conte said. Italy has reported more than 19,000 coronavirus deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.  United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been discharged from the hospital, a Downing Street spokesperson said. \u201cThe PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery, at Chequers,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOn the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work. He wishes to thank everybody at St. Thomas\u2019 for the brilliant care he has received.\" The spokesperson added: \u201cAll of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.\u201d Johnson's fianc\u00e9e, Carrie Symonds, thanked the British National Health Service after a \"very dark\" week, she said Sunday in a series of tweets following his discharge from the hospital. Symonds said, \"I cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough. The staff at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital have been incredible. I will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you.\"\u00a0 Johnson issued a statement Saturday thanking the National Health Service staff at St. Thomas' Hospital following his treatment for coronavirus, saying \"I can't thank them enough. I owe them my life,\" according to the UK Press Association. This is the first known statement from the Prime Minister since he entered hospital last Sunday night. Some context: Johnson\u00a0announced he tested positive\u00a0for the novel coronavirus on March 27. He said he was experiencing \"mild symptoms\" and would continue leading the country, while self-isolating in his apartment in Downing Street. But 10 days later, 10 Downing Street announced the 55-year-old was not getting better and was taken to St. Thomas' Hospital in London. He was moved to an intensive care unit (ICU) the next day after his condition deteriorated. Johnson spent three nights in intensive care and received \"standard oxygen treatment,\" according to his spokesman, but did not require mechanical or invasive ventilation. He was moved out of the ICU on Thursday night. On Friday, a spokesperson said the Prime Minister was \"able to do short walks\" in between periods of rest and waved his thanks to staff. The Spanish government has stated to loosen some of the toughest restrictions on people\u2019s movements imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic starting this week.\u00a0 Spain has been one of the hardest-hit countries, with hundreds of new deaths being reported every day and the highest death-rate in the world per million inhabitants. People who can\u2019t work at home and whose places of employment are reopening may return to work after the Easter holidays. The move is aimed at such sectors as construction and manufacturing\u00a0\u2013 but non-essential retail outlets, bars and places of entertainment must remain closed. Restaurants can only offer take-out. Hairdressers will only be able go to clients\u2019 homes but can\u2019t open their salons and banks will have a minimum service with only a few branches open. The government announced over the weekend that police would begin handing out 10 million protective masks at metro stations and other transport hubs to workers after the Easter break, while reiterating guidance on social distancing and regular washing of hands. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has cautioned that a return to normal life would be \u201cprogressive.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t even know what kind of normality we\u2019re returning to,\u201d Sanchez said last week. \u201cThe climb has been difficult, the descent will also be,\u201d Sanchez told Parliament last week as the state of emergency was extended to April 26. Sanchez has warned that it may need to be further extended. \u00a0##Daily Life## South Korea announced Sunday that the government will form a vaccine development support group this week, which will involve members of government, academia, industry, research institutions and hospitals. The joint support group will be led by the Ministries of Health and Science to form a quick decision-making system to aid in the development of treatment in South Korea. Earlier in the week, President Moon Jae-in held a meeting during which he vowed to \u201cprovide all the financial, administrative, and policy support\u201d for the development of a vaccine, according to Health Minister Park Neung-hoo. \"If we put their efforts together, we can develop both the vaccine and treatment in the fastest time possible,\" Park said at a briefing on Sunday. Such cooperation would cut down the time taken for administrative reasons and provide infrastructure or resources needed, Park said. Race for a vaccine: This week, a study published in The Lancet medical journal warned that coronavirus\u00a0lockdowns\u00a0across the globe should not be completely lifted until a vaccine for the disease is found. China's draconian restrictions on daily life appear to have halted the first wave of\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0across much of the country, but the researchers used mathematical modeling to show that premature lifting of measures could result in a sweeping second wave of infection. ##Health## Pope Francis has said the world needs to be united in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, in a special address after Easter mass on Sunday. \u201cThis is not a time for indifference, because the whole world is suffering and needs to be united in facing the pandemic,\u201d the Pope said during his address, known as \"Urbi et Orbi\" (To the City and the World). The Pope also called for an \u201cimmediate global ceasefire\u201d and an end to weapons manufacturing.  Francis called on international leaders to relax sanctions and reduce or forgive debt for poorer countries.\u00a0 In light of the present circumstances,\u201d the Pope said,\u00a0\u201cmay international sanctions be relaxed, since these make it difficult for countries on which they have been imposed to provide adequate support to their citizens, and may all nations be put in a position to meet the greatest needs of the moment through the reduction, if not the forgiveness, of the debt burdening the balance sheets of the poorest nations.\u201d Francis remembered those who are sick and have died due to Covid-19, as well as doctors, nurses and health care workers. Images and a live streamed video from the Vatican showed an empty St. Peter's square.  The UK is \u201clikely to be one of the worst, if not the worst, affected countries in Europe,\u201d Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a UK government adviser said Sunday.  \"The numbers in the UK have continued to go up, I do hope that we're coming close to the number of new infections reducing, and in a week or two the number of people of people needing hospital reducing,\" he said, adding that he hoped the number of UK deaths would plateau and start to fall in a couple of weeks.  Some 9,875\u00a0people have died of coronavirus in the UK, and almost 80,000 cases have been confirmed, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.  He told BBC's Andrew Marr that Germany had so far managed to keep its numbers low by introducing testing at a \"remarkable\" scale early on and isolating those who had contracted the virus.  Farrar also said a second or third wave of coronavirus was \"probably inevitable.\"  He said he thought a vaccine will be available during autumn this year, but that it will not be available on the scale required to protect people around the world. WATCH: Farrar tells Amanpour: 'The lockdown cannot go into 2021' ##Health## Spain recorded 619 deaths due to coronavirus in the past 24 hours, according to new data from the Spanish Health Ministry on Sunday.\u00a0 This is the highest daily death toll for the past three days and represents a 3.7% increase. The total number of fatalities stands at 16,972. There are currently 86,656 active cases in the country, and 62,391 people have recovered. Lockdown extended, but restrictions eased: The nationwide lockdown has been extended to almost the end of April, for a total of six weeks. But the government, pointing to a much slower rate of increase in the number of deaths and of new cases, will ease restrictions on Monday for some workers, allowing construction sites and factories to resume activity. ##Health## The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, says society cannot return to its old ways once the coronavirus epidemic has passed. The Church of England\u2019s most senior cleric recorded his Easter message on an iPad at his kitchen table, as large gatherings have been banned under social distancing rules. \u00a0 \u201cAfter so much suffering, so much heroism from key workers and the NHS and their equivalents all across the globe. Once the epidemic is conquered here and elsewhere, we cannot be content to go back to what was before \u2013 as if all was normal,\u201d he said. Archbishop Welby used his sermon to call for the \u201cresurrection of our common life.\u201d \u201cEven in the dark days of this Easter we can feed on hope. We can dream of what our country and our world will look like after the pandemic.\u201d \u201cAt this very difficult time in the life of the nation and of the world, our prayers today are especially with those who are suffering, with those who care for them, and for all who mourn,\u201d the Archbishop said. Easter under lockdown: The Pope told the world to \"not yield to fear\" ahead of Easter Sunday, which most Christians will mark from their homes instead of church. Francis himself will be livestreaming a service on YouTube.  ##Daily Life## Two doctors in Bogota, Colombia are the latest Covid-19 related fatalities in the country, the Minister of Health Dr. Fernando Ruiz announced on Saturday.\u00a0 The doctors were identified as Carlos Fabi\u00e1n Nieto, 33, and Dr. William Guti\u00e9rrez, 59. According to the minister, they were working in two of the most reputable medical institutions in the Colombian capital. Ru\u00edz said the two doctors who died received the best care and had the best protection, but he said \"we are facing a phenomenon that in the world takes the lives of many people and among them, unfortunately, health workers.\" According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, Colombia has more than 2,700 confirmed cases of the virus.  The Chinese city of\u00a0Suifenhe, which borders Russia, has banned all types of gatherings in the city, the local government announced Saturday.\u00a0 Border closed and measures in place: After locking down the border with Russia on Thursday over fears of coronavirus transmissions, local authorities imposed stern measures in the city. Public gatherings are now banned and facilities are shut, according to the statement.\u00a0 Among the locations closed include hotels, travel agencies, public bath houses, tourist destinations, bars, karaoke bars, internet bars, cinemas, gyms, swimming pools and chess rooms. Wet markets, supermarkets and pharmacies are considered \"essential businesses\" and will stay open,\u00a0authorities\u00a0said.\u00a0 Russia reports jump in cases: Russia reported its largest daily increase in cases since the outbreak began on Sunday, with the number of confirmed coronavirus jumping by 2,186 within 24 hours. This brings the total number of cases to\u00a015,770, according to Russian state news agency TASS. There are at least\u00a0530,006\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, and at least\u00a020,608\u00a0people have died in the U.S. from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States. Grim milestone: The US has the most coronavirus related deaths in the world.  The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0 Wyoming is the only state that is not reporting a death from coronavirus. This Easter Sunday, the Rev. Tim Kesicki, the head of the Jesuit order in North America, will officiate a Mass around his family's dining room table. The service will include just Kesicki, his sister and parents at their home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But it won't necessarily be a quiet Mass. \"During the homily, it is not uncommon for my mom to offer comments,\" Kesicki said, laughing. \"It's very welcome, of course.\" Kesicki, who lives in Washington, DC, has celebrated Mass with his family before, a perk of being an ordained Catholic priest. But for many Christians, Easter this year will be dramatically different: a home-bound, shelter-in-place holy day. No Easter parades, no egg hunts at church, no church at all. As there's been all Lent, there's a solemness in the air. It doesn't escape many Christians that they're celebrating Jesus' resurrection at a time of rampant sickness and death. More than 1.7 million people around the world have been infected by the novel coronavirus, and over 100,000 have died,\u00a0according Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0The collateral damage can seem nearly as stunning. More than 16 million Americans were out of jobs in just the last three weeks. The pandemic has emptied St. Peter's Square of pilgrims, silenced the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and shuttered the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the site of the first Easter two millennia ago. Sanctuaries across the world, normally filled with Easter lilies and families wearing spring pastels and holiday hats, sit vacant this Sunday. Read the full story here.   The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia jumped by 2,186 within 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to\u00a015,770, according to Russian state news agency TASS on Sunday.  The jump is the largest daily increase in cases in Russia since the outbreak began. The number of coronavirus deaths in Russia rose to 130 -- an increase of 24 deaths in the past day, TASS reported.\u00a0 Concentration in Russian capital: Most of the cases are concentrated in Moscow, which has a total of 10,158 coronavirus cases. In the last day, the Russian capital recorded 1,306 new coronavirus cases and 14 deaths.\u00a0 China\u2019s southern City of Guangzhou denied discriminatory practices towards foreigners in implementing coronavirus containment measures. Here's some background: CNN reported Saturday the African community in Guangzhou is on edge after accounts shared widely on social media of people being left homeless this week. Africans have been evicted from their homes by landlords and turned away from hotels, despite many claiming to have no recent travel history or known contact with Covid-19 patients. CNN interviewed more than two dozen Africans living in Guangzhou many of whom told of the same experiences: being left without a home, being subject to random testing for Covid-19, and being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Consulate sends warning: On Saturday, the US Consulate in Guangzhou sent out a message to those registered as US citizens with the embassy, warning African-Americans to avoid travel to the city due escalating scrutiny and policies by Chinese officials in relation to Covid-19. The message warned that the Chinese legal system \u201ccan be opaque\u201d and that US citizens could be subject to \u201cheightened scrutiny by Chinese local law enforcement and state security.\u201d Chinese officials have denied discriminatory practices towards foreigners.  \u201cWe have always attached great importance to the safety of foreigners in Guangzhou and have guaranteed their legitimate rights in accordance with law. Police authorities have treated Chinese and foreign citizens in Guangzhou equally, and made no differentiation in enforcing epidemic control and prevention measures,\u201d Guangzhou Police spokesman Cai Wei said at a press conference on Sunday. He added foreigners need to strictly abide by Chinese laws and show identification documents when requested by police. Those who refuse to do so are subject to punishment, Cai said, adding most foreigners have been cooperative. Guangzhou\u2019s director of foreign affairs said the city has a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy toward discrimination, adding \"we treat all foreigners in Guangzhou equally. We are opposed to differentiated treatment targeting certain groups,\u201d according to state media. ##Daily Life## France's flagship aircraft carrier the\u00a0Charles\u00a0de\u00a0Gaulle,\u00a0which\u00a0has\u00a050 confirmed coronavirus cases on board, will arrive in Toulon on Sunday afternoon and begin to quarantine personnel, according to the French\u00a0Defense Ministry.\u00a0 The crews of the aircraft carrier, the on-board air group -- helicopters, Hawkeye and Rafale surveillance planes -- and the accompanying warship\u00a0Chevalier Paul\u00a0will be confined for 14 days on military bases before returning home, the Defense Ministry said in a statement Sunday. \"The primary objective is to protect soldiers, their loved ones and our fellow citizens. Accommodation and food capacities will be set up at naval and naval air bases, to ensure the best reception for sailors in the quarantine,\" the ministry said in a statement.  The ministry said that screenings will be carried out in the containment zone before sailors return to their homes, and buildings and aircraft disinfected by specialized teams.  According to a previous Defense Ministry statement, the flagship carrier left France on January 21 and was in the Atlantic. A medical team arrived on board on April 8, according to the Defense Ministry. ##Daily Life## If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know: The numbers: The coronavirus pandemic has infected 1.7 million people and killed more than 108,000 around the world. The US has the most coronavirus related deaths in the world -- at least 20,604 -- and more than half a million cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. On Saturday,\u00a028,586\u00a0new US cases were reported and\u00a01,846\u00a0people died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 South Korea will test all travelers entering from US for coronavirus, requiring everyone traveling from the US to test for coronavirus within three days of entry as of Monday. Easter in lockdown: The Pope told the world \"not yield to fear\" ahead of Easter Sunday, which most Christians will mark from their homes instead of church. Francis himself will be\u00a0livestreaming a service on YouTube. Three Indian states have extended lockdown: The state of Maharashtra, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in\u00a0India, has extended its lockdown until \"at least\" Thursday, April 30, while the states of Punjab and Odisha have already announced a lockdown extension until the end of the month. India has a total of 8,356 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 273 deaths as of 9 a.m. Sunday local time, according to the country's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Japan announced a record spike in number of coronavirus cases for fifth day in a row: The country's health ministry recorded 714 new coronavirus cases and four deaths on Saturday.  The\u00a0Navajo Nation\u00a0enacted a\u00a057-hour curfew over the holiday weekend\u00a0in an effort to combat the spread of\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0among its more than 250,000 members. As of Saturday, there were 698 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 24 deaths, among members of the Navajo Nation living in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah,\u00a0Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and Vice President Myron Lizer said in a news release. Both\u00a0Nez\u00a0and\u00a0Lizer\u00a0are in self-quarantine, Nez announced Thursday, after coming in contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. You may be young and in good health, but this virus can infect anyone,\" Nez said. \"This is not to be taken lightly.\" ##Daily Life## South Korea will\u00a0strengthen\u00a0measures for\u00a0travelers from the US, extending the same requirement that previously only applied to travelers from Europe, the country's\u00a0Centers for Disease Control Director Jung Eun-kyeong announced on Sunday at a briefing. From Monday midnight, everyone traveling from the US will be required to test for coronavirus within three days of entry.  Previously, travelers coming from the US were required to self-isolate but only test for coronavirus if symptomatic.\u00a0 Director Jung said that the measure was taken because \"as the ratio of positive cases among those entering from the US continues to rise, and the risk of community spread in the US continues to rise, we deem that the risk of infection of travelers from the US has risen.\" South Korea has 32 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday, of which 24 were imported. That brings the total number of cases to 10,512 and 214 deaths. ##Daily Life## ##Health## The state of Maharashtra, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in\u00a0India, has extended its lockdown until \"at least\" Thursday, April 30. \"We have no option but to extend the lockdown beyond April 14. This will go on till at least till April 30. I am stressing on the word at least because it all depends on our social discipline and not crowding areas like markets,\" the Office of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Uddav Thackeray,\u00a0said on Twitter. The states of Punjab and Odisha have already announced a lockdown extension until the end of April.  The three-week lockdown initially announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ends on April 14.

The Big Apple had just become the country's epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic. \"We just had this helpless feeling and we wanted to do something for them,\" Lisa MacGregor, a nurse at Brigham, told CNN. \"With the\u00a0Boston marathon terror attack, people were sending us cards and food. I just remember how stressed we were and how much that meant to us.\" So the staff at Brigham raised money and sent restaurant meals to two of New York's hardest-hit emergency rooms,\u00a0Mt. Sinai Queens\u00a0and\u00a0Elmhurst Hospital. A few of MacGregor's colleagues completed their residencies at those hospitals. For them, the kind act was personal. For everyone at Brigham and Women's Hospital, it was a show of solidarity. \"We see what they are doing over there, and we are watching them,\" MacGregor said of the New York health care teams. \"And we are with them.\" Read more here.

But her experience of suddenly losing her sense of smell, combined with \"weird head rushes,\" headaches and exhaustion led her doctor to diagnose her \"straight off the bat\" with\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0over the phone. While there have yet to be robust studies on the link between coronavirus and smell, doctors have reported anecdotally that losing the ability to smell may be among the virus's symptoms -- but how widespread that is, and how long it might last, is unclear. \"I feel lucky I don't have the really scary symptoms,\" the 33-year-old author says. However, she describes her loss of the sense of smell, or anosmia, as \"one of the most upsetting things I've ever gone through because you're not in the driving seat.... I just feel really powerless and scared.\" Read more here. In Australia, previously mundane chores are being turned into a fun public outing in the midst of\u00a0self-isolation. Just scroll down the\u00a0Bin Isolation Outing Facebook group\u00a0to see. Originally begun as a joke between friends, the page now has half a million members and counting -- and is filled with photos and videos of folks around Australia (and, increasingly, the world) taking their bins to the curb in fun costumes. Danielle Askew created the page two weeks ago, after a friend jokingly wrote on Facebook that she was excited to take the bin out because it gave her a reason to leave the house. So Askew, who lives in Hervey Bay, Australia, dared her to get dressed up for it. She did, as did Askew, who then started the Facebook page as a way to have a laugh with her friend group. But that page quickly went beyond the group and Australia, reaching folks as far away as the US. What was supposed to be a private joke has turned into a source of joy for people everywhere, as more and more people find themselves stuck inside. Read more here. Pope Francis told followers to \"not yield to fear\" while leading an Easter Vigil the night before Easter Sunday inside an empty St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday. Quoting Jesus upon the resurrection, Pope Francis said: \"Do not be afraid, do not yield to fear. This is the message of hope. It is addressed to us today. These are the words that God repeats to us this very night.\" The vigil, typically attended by thousands, was scaled back amid\u00a0coronavirus lockdown measures. \"We are all brothers and sisters -- may we bring the song of life,\" he added. The Pope also used the address to urge against the arms trade. \"Let us silence the cries of death, no more wars! May we stop the production and trade of weapons, since we need bread, not guns.\" The vigil was part of the\u00a0Pope's Easter Triduum liturgies, a series of ceremonies given during the days leading to Easter Sunday -- beginning with Holy Thursday. The vigil is to be followed by Sunday's event, when the Pope will host\u00a0Easter Sunday Mass\u00a0at 5 a.m. EST or 11 a.m. Rome time. There are several treatments being studied to prevent or treat coronavirus, but US President Donald Trump has been a cheerleader for one in particular:\u00a0hydroxychloroquine, a drug currently used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Over the past month, he's made many optimistic statements about hydroxychloroquine. CNN has fact-checked the president multiple times -- such as\u00a0here,\u00a0here, and\u00a0here\u00a0-- and found that he's being unrealistically enthusiastic. Physicians, including Trump's own advisor,\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, have emphasized that in order to know if a drug is going to work -- and be safe -- it has to be studied in clinical trials. It might work, but it might not. It might be safe, but it also could hurt patients. Read the facts on hydroxychloroquine here. In a late evening decision the Kansas Supreme Court sided with Kansas Governor Laura Kelly saying the Legislative Coordinating Council (LCC) did not have the authority to override Gov. Kelly's Executive Order 20-18 which temporarily banned mass gatherings of 10 or more people. The LCC, which is composed of House and Senate leaders, voted along party lines Wednesday to throw out the Gov. Kelly's order. Gov. Kelly's administration filed the lawsuit against the state's LCC Thursday evening. With the court's ruling the governor's order will now be in place for Easter Sunday services. ##Daily Life## Japan's health ministry recorded 714 new coronavirus cases and four deaths on Saturday.

Although we confined the contagion, we cannot sing victory,\" Maduro said in a phone call to state-run VTV. As the current state of emergency was due to expire on Monday April 13, the new announcement appears to indicate that the lockdown will run through May 13, although Maduro did not mention specific dates. Venezuela has 175 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and nine deaths related, according to the Maduro government. However, testing for the virus has not been widespread in the country. Maduro first declared a state of alarm on March 13 and, shortly afterward, a nationwide quarantine in order to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. ##Daily Life## As of 10 p.m. Eastern time, there are at least\u00a0529,740\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

The coronavirus has claimed more than 2,500 lives in the city, accounting for 77% of all Covid-19 deaths in China, according to the National Health Commission. As life starts to regain some semblance of normality, thousands of bereft families are faced with a task that has been put on hold for months: burying their loved ones. \"My heart was broken in Wuhan,\" Zhang said of his hometown in central China, the original epicenter of the now global pandemic. \"Inside, I'm filled with grief, and anger.\" Read more here. ##Daily Life## An administration official told CNN that the United States government's top public health experts agreed in the third week of February on the need to begin moving away from a containment strategy and toward a mitigation strategy that would involve aggressive social distancing measures. The agreement among the health officials came after they held a tabletop exercise to game out the potential for a full-blown pandemic, the official told CNN. The public health officials had planned to urge US President Donald Trump to move toward a mitigation strategy after he returned from a trip to India, the administration official said, but that meeting was scrapped after Trump returned to Washington infuriated by a plunging stock market and CDC official Dr. Nancy Messonier's warning about \"severe\" disruptions to daily life. Messonier was merely voicing the consensus among the administration's public health experts, but she jumped the gun -- doing so without getting official buy-in. The official also confirmed that a February 23 email from a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology sharing a report of potential asymptomatic spread of the disease caused alarm among several top officials, the official said. It would take more than three weeks for Trump to enact social distancing guidelines, on March 16.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, now out of quarantine after his wife tested positive for the virus in March, attended the scaled-down session with a \"quorum\" of about 20 lawmakers. Opposition parties joined Trudeau\u2019s governing party to unanimously approve the wage-subsidy scheme, which will cost more than $50 billion (in US currency) and will be applied retroactively to days worked since March 15. A majority of Canadian companies are likely to qualify for the subsidy. ##Daily Life## New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Saturday that a public health order banning mass gatherings was amended to include houses of worship.\u00a0 \u201cWe know that you want to practice your faith, as you should.
