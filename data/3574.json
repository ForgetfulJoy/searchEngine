Coronavirus\u00a0 The federal government has activated the National Guard in California, Washington and New York, three of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak. President Trump said the extra forces will provide backup to state leaders. New York and at least seven other states are facing orders from their governors to stay home. In India, millions of residents living in 75 districts across the country are under lockdown as the second-most populous country in the world tries to avoid becoming a potential powder keg for coronavirus spread. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats\u00a0have\u00a0blocked movement on the massive trillion-dollar Republican-backed stimulus package. Democrats say there isn't enough regulation in the $500 billion allotted to struggling businesses, and have expressed concern they weren't involved in the proposal's creation. A vote on the package is expected at 1:00 pm today. 2. Tokyo Olympics It's looking more and more likely that the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo will be postponed. Japanese officials and the International Olympic Committee have both seemed reticent to alter the event despite growing pressure to do so. The tipping point came this weekend when both Canada and Australia announced they would not send athletes to the Olympics due to coronavirus concerns. Both countries' Olympic committees called for the Games to be postponed until 2021. On Monday morning, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the Games was a possibility, softening his staunch stance that the games must start on time. The IOC says a final decision will be made in the next four weeks.\u00a0 3. Colombia   A prison riot\u00a0in Colombia prompted by coronavirus fears has left at least 23 inmates dead and 83 injured. The country's Justice Minister Margarita Cabello\u00a0said the incident began with a \"massive and criminal escape attempt\" at\u00a0Bogota's La Modelo prison, one of the country's largest and most overpopulated prisons. Cabello also said there was unrest in other penitentiary centers around the country. The health and security of prison inmates and prison staff is a growing concern. In Italy, a dozen inmates have died and dozens more have escaped in similar riots and, in the US, there have been several confirmed cases of coronavirus in prison systems across the country.\u00a0 4. Election 2020 While the human and economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic are certainly top of mind, the political stakes get higher every day as the US inches toward the November general election. Experts agree President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis will be the most critical moment in his presidency so far\u00a0and could alter\u00a0his reelection chances. As far as actual voting is concerned, election officials and voting rights groups are calling for a general move to a full vote-by-mail system\u00a0for remaining primaries and the November general election.\u00a0 5. Weather  It\u00a0may officially be spring, but there's a potential Nor'easter brewing along the East Coast that could dump unseasonable amounts of snow in New York, New England and parts of Canada. In the worst-case scenario, interior portions of the Northeast could get 6 to 12 inches of spring snow when the storm hits early this week, probably Tuesday. Though the storm is expected to move rapidly, don't get too comfortable yet -- there's another round of snow expected to follow shortly after.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these.
