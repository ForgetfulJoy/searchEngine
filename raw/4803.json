The famous director was once an aspiring actor who landed a gig as an Elvis impersonator on the hit comedy sitcom \"The Golden Girls,\" which ran from 1985 to 1992. \"One of the jobs I did get, and not because I did a wonderful audition, but simply because they sent my picture in and they said, 'He's got it,' was for an Elvis impersonator on 'The Golden Girls.' \" he told Jimmy Fallon on his late-night show Wednesday night. But it turns out that job had a lot to do with his first hit feature film, \"Reservoir Dogs.\" \"It became a two-part 'Golden Girls.' So I got paid residuals for both parts,\" shared Tarantino. \"It was so popular they put it on a 'Best of The Golden Girls,' and I got residuals every time that showed. So I got paid maybe, I don't know, $650 for the episode, but by the time the residuals were over, three years later, I made like $3,000. And that kept me going during our pre-production time trying to get 'Reservoir Dogs' going.\""], "Language": false}
