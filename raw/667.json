Facts Although created by the Rome Statute, a treaty first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates as an independent entity.  The court is located in The Hague, Netherlands.  The ICC is the \"court of last resort,\" and came into force on July 1, 2002. The court tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. It is not intended to replace a national justice system.  Currently, 137 states are signatories, but only 123 are considered parties to the treaty. The United States is a signatory to the treaty, but not a party.  Cases are referred to the court by national governments or the United Nations Security Council. The 18 judges serve nine-year terms.
