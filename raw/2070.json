This would be Kim's first public appearance since he missed the celebration of his grandfather's birthday on April 15, leading to questions about the leader's health. CNN cannot independently confirm the reporting of the news agency. Kim Jong Un is the third son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. His exact birth year is publicly unavailable, but he is widely believed to be in his 30s now.  Kim attends a military parade alongside his father, left, in October 2010.

History was made in April 2018 when Kim became the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korean territory since 1953. South Korean President Moon Jae-in was waiting to greet him at the military demarcation line that has long divided the two Koreas. The two leaders\u00a0shook hands\u00a0at the line, and then, in a symbolic move, Moon joined Kim on the northern side of the line before they crossed into the southern side together.\u00a0Their historic summit\u00a0culminated with a declaration that the two countries \u2014 who have been technically at war for almost 70 years now \u2014 would later sign a peace treaty.\u00a0 Kim and Moon embrace after signing a joint statement at their summit in April 2018.
