The Pok\u00e9mon Company's strategy this year centered around the Netflix launch of an animated movie \"Pok\u00e9mon: Mewtwo Strikes Back\u2014Evolution.\" Pok\u00e9mon featured in the film like the \"armored Mewtwo\" are appearing on software company Niantic's hit mobile game Pok\u00e9mon Go, as are the iconic Pikachu and Eevee, according to a press release. \"This shows Pok\u00e9mon Go has become an important part of the Pok\u00e9mon property and that Niantic is still finding new ways to keep its game relevant even nearly four years after release,\" said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at market research firm Sensor Tower. \"Pok\u00e9mon GO's continued success has relied heavily on Niantic's ability to deliver a ceaseless stream of new content and live events, and I would imagine this is just the first of many such tie-ins.\" On last year's Pok\u00e9mon Day, the hit mobile game Pok\u00e9mon Go generated about $4 million in global player spending, according to Sensor Tower, up 186% from the $1.4 million spent on the same day in 2018. Sensor Tower predicts spending to be close to $2 million this year. \"Pok\u00e9mon Go has remained popular with gamers in the US since its launch,\" said Adithya Venkatraman, market insights manager at mobile insights and analytics company App Annie. Venkatraman noted that as of February 26, Pok\u00e9mon Go was ranked the fourth highest grossing game on the iPhone in the US.  While back in 1996, Pok\u00e9mon was limited to a pair of games, \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Green,\" today the brand has expanded into movies that can be streamed on Netflix, popular mobile games, T-shirts and more, the company noted in its release. The company held various online events this week to engage with fans. One of them included asking fans to vote for their favorite creature on Google. The winning Pok\u00e9mon was \"Greninja,\" a frog-like Pok\u00e9mon that has the agility of a ninja. Last November, two new console titles, \"Pok\u00e9mon Sword\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Shield\" arrived on Nintendo Switch. Since then, Nintendo has updated the games' online content and has sold downloadable content. For Pok\u00e9mon Day, the games are getting a new mythical Pok\u00e9mon. More details about the creature were revealed Thursday: it's called \"Zarude,\" a rogue monkey Pok\u00e9mon that swings around on trees and attacks with sharp claws, according to Pok\u00e9mon's official Twitter account."], "Language": false}
