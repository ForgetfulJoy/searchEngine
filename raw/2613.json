The proposal from the Middle East Architecture Network (MEAN) is intended for installation on a roundabout close to the site of Expo 2020 - the world fair that opens in Dubai on October 20, 2020.  During the day, solar panels would store energy for later use. The concrete columns are intended to mimic palm trees.  MEAN is a Dubai-based collective, formalized in late 2017, that positions itself at the intersection of design and technology. This installation for the Audi Innovation Hub at Dubai Design Week is formed of cables, steel, and recycled rubber from car tires.  MEAN often makes use of biomimicry in its projects - design inspired by nature. This design for a bus shelter is modeled on seashells. This 3D-printed pavilion in Dubai's financial district is formed of 30,000 recycled plastic bottles.  Design for a 3D-printed pavilion at the Wadi Rum resort destination in Jordan. The vision updates traditional Bedouin tents.  MEAN proposal for the Barjeel Art Foundation Museum in Sharjah, UAE. The modular design would lead a visitor through a timeline of Pan-Arab works.   Proposal for the Yeoui-Naru Ferry Terminal in Seoul, South Korea, featuring a solar  roof.  One of MEAN's earliest pieces \"Arid\" went on show at Amman Design Week in 2017, illustrating the impact of climate change.  The collective also produce smaller pieces, such as this 3D-printed lamp.
