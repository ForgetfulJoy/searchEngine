They're touring anyway. And if we're lucky, they'll tour forever.  The band announced the rest of their North American tour dates that'll run through summer 2020.  The Stones postponed their North American tour in May 2019 so frontman Mick Jagger could recover from heart surgery. Looks like he's back in strutting shape now. The band will kick off the rest of their \"No Filter\" tour, which started in 2017, in May 2020. Expect Jagger to flaunt and flail through the 15 cities like he's wont to do.  Tickets go on sale on February 14, but pre-sale codes will be sent out earlier that week.  And if you've forgotten why the Stones have enjoyed international fame for more than 50 years, they'll quickly remind you.  The band released a best-of compilation album, \"Honk,\" during their tour hiatus.
