Texas, home to nearly 30 million people, has unveiled one of the most wide-ranging plans to restart the economy, with Governor Greg Abbott announcing that businesses including malls, restaurants and theaters will be allowed to open their doors, with limited capacity, from Friday. The move has been met with criticism, including from the Houston Chronicle's editorial board, which wrote last week that without more robust testing, any move to reopen the state is \"gambling with people's lives.\" President Donald Trump yesterday unveiled a \"blueprint\" to expand nationwide testing, but critics say it puts the onus on already over-stretched states, and public health experts warn it falls far short of what's necessary. Meanwhile, Attorney General Willam Barr, who previously lamented stay-at-home orders as \"draconian,\" has told federal prosecutors to be on guard for \"overbearing\" state and local coronavirus measures.     Countries that have pursued aggressive approaches to testing, like New Zealand and Australia, are beginning to reopen after a dramatic drop in infections. Nearly half a million people have returned to work in New Zealand, and Australia's celebrated Bondi Beach reopened today to surfers and swimmers. France, Italy and Spain, among the hardest-hit countries in Europe, have also announced tentative plans to ease restrictions.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED Q: Can children get sick from coronavirus?

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY China doubles down on surveillance  The morning after Ian Lahiffe returned to Beijing, he found a surveillance camera being mounted on the wall outside his apartment door. Its lens was pointing right at him. Chinese authorities have been installing cameras outside \u2014 and in some cases even inside \u2014 the homes of those under quarantine since at least February, Nectar Gan writes.  As China expands its digital \"health code\" system to track people's movements, its response to the coronavirus continues to come under fire from the US. Trump said again yesterday that China could have stopped the outbreak before it swept the globe, and that the US was conducting \"serious investigations\" into what happened. Conspiracy theories spread faster than virus Maatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China. The virulent conspiracy, which metastasized on YouTube and is now being promoted by Chinese Communist Party media, has turned her life upside down. But while technology giants have touted the steps they're taking to combat coronavirus misinformation, they've failed to help Benassi, Donie O'Sullivan writes.  Has Sweden's anti-lockdown strategy succeeded? Sweden has been an outlier during the coronavirus outbreak. The country has not joined many of its European neighbors in imposing strict limits on citizens' lives, and images of people heading to work on busy streets, or chatting at cafes and bars have raised eyebrows. While the country claims its resistance to a full lockdown has worked, the numbers suggest a different story, Emma Reynolds writes.

Meanwhile, a group of leading scientists have warned that future pandemics are likely to be more frequent, deadly, and will spread more rapidly, unless we stop the widespread destruction of our environment.
