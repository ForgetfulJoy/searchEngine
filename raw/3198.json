This woman raised you, shaped you and made you the person you are today \u2014 and um, she changed your diapers. For years. But most importantly, coronavirus is making traditional Mother's Day celebrations a no-go this year.  Social distancing guidelines are likely going to extend well into May, making brunches and family get-togethers an impossibility for most of us.
