After shooting his first short documentary in 2016, the director went on to make 49 more in just two-and-a-half years. Earlier this year, we shared his film, \u201cMaori Metal.\u201d Today, we\u2019re proud to present his next documentary, \u201cThis Film Used to Be About Rum.\u201d\n \n\u201cThis Film Used to Be About Rum,\u201d which began with the working title \u201c130 Years of Rum,\u201d chronicles Freid\u2019s attempt to make a film about Cuba\u2019s plan to repay a Soviet-era debt to the Czech Republic in rum. \n\nWhat links both films is Freid\u2019s sense of humor. In \u201cMaori Metal,\u201d the humor was drawn through Alien Weaponry\u2019s van, which Freid took inspiration from the movie \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine.\u201d  As for \u201cThis Film Used to be About Rum,\u201d the director started with the goal of making a light-hearted film. \u201cWe were just naively gallivanting into an active military dictatorship with the idea that we would do a puff piece, which is hilarious,\u201d Freid reflects.\n\nBut he found out it wasn\u2019t going to be so easy to make his \u201cpuff piece.\u201d Soon after Freid arrived in Cuba to shoot the film, one of his key subjects canceled a scheduled interview at the last minute because of \u201cpolitical suspicions.\u201d The person also warned Freid to be careful because the secret police might be following him.\n\nOthers also became unwilling to talk. Given the lack of cooperation, Freid might have packed his bags and given up on the project. But he ultimately turned the camera on himself and made a film about how hard it is to make a film about Cuban rum.\n\nThe ability to pivot is crucial when you are making a documentary, according to Freid. \u201cIf you just allow yourself to play jazz and be open to what comes at you,\u201d he says, \u201cyou might realize that the thing just to the right of the camera, just out of frame, is more interesting than the thing you\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\nWhen we\u2019re not making films, we\u2019re watching them. Introducing \u201cGreat Big Spotlight,\u201d Great Big Story\u2019s latest series highlighting our favorite documentaries from some of the best filmmaking talent out there.
