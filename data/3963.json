And, frankly, it's a lot to process.  But Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) does a good job summing up all the action -- \"Welcome to the end of the game.\"  Indeed, it looks like major events are about to go down, not the least of which appears to be a tense face-off between Dolores and Maeve (Thandie Newton).
