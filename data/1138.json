Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is preparing to sign orders that could lead to the deployment of both of the US Navy\u2019s hospital ships and a mobile hospital facility, according to two defense officials. The two hospital ships are the USNS Mercy, currently in port in San Diego, and the USNS Comfort in Norfolk where it is undergoing maintenance.

Activating the EMF could lead to Seabees being called to build the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0 But a limiting factor remain on how all of the medical needs for ships and hospital get manned.  \u201cAll of those doctors and nurses either come from our medical treatment facilities or they come from the Reserves which means civilians and so what we have go to be very conscious of and careful of as we call up these units and use them to support the states that we aren\u2019t robbing Peter to pay Paul,\u201d Esper said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is take reservists from a hospital where they are needed just to put them on a ship somewhere else where they are needed so we have to be very conscious of that.\u201d Esper said he had spoken to several governors about that very challenge. ##Health## Monterey and San Benito counties in Northern California are asking residents to shelter in place.

Therefore, the bill will enable the police and immigration officers to detain a person, for a limited period, who is, or may be, infectious and to take them to a suitable place to enable screening and assessment,\u201d an outline of the \"coronavirus bill\" on the UK government websites said. This is a step up from the March 3\u00a0government guidelines in which authorities could only detain those not respecting mandated quarantines.

The UK currently still has freedom of movement within the EU until the end of the Brexit transition period. However, under EU law, EU citizens or members of their family may be expelled from the host Member State on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. \u201cThe President has fought hard with the European authorities to make a coherent response possible,\u201d Philippe told France 2.\u00a0\u201cOn the issue of containment, it may make sense to do sanitary border control. Closing borders completely also means making it more complicated to get the products we need. \u201cIt is not illegitimate to re-establish health controls at borders. We must ensure that entry into the European area is controlled,\u201d Philippe added. ##Travel## South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has issued an executive order closing all South Carolina restaurants and bars except for delivery and takeout, he announced at a news conference.

Marshall Burke, an assistant professor at Stanford's Department of Earth System Science, said\u00a0the better air quality could have saved between 50,000 and 75,000 people from dying prematurely. \"The reductions in air pollution in China caused by this economic disruption likely saved twenty times more lives in China than have currently been lost due to infection with the virus in that country,\" Burke wrote on G-Feed, a site run by a group of scientists researching the relationship between society and the environment. The scientist quantified the improved air quality in four Chinese cities and, using data gathered around the 2008 Beijing Olympics when Chinese authorities implemented strict pollution controls on industry and transportation, calculated the estimated improvement in premature deaths for children under 5 and people over 70. Burke calculated that the two months of cleaner air has saved the lives of between 1,400 and 4,000 kids under 5 and 51,700 to 73,000 adults over 70 in China. He said that while the cleaner air likely saved lives, the broader disruption caused by COVID-19 could cause many additional deaths that are not directly attributable to being infected with the virus.\u00a0 \"Does this mean pandemics are good for health? No,\" he said. \"Instead it means that the way our economies operate absent pandemics has massive hidden health costs, and it takes a pandemic to help see that.\" ##Health## The Brooklyn Nets announced on Tuesday that four players on the team had tested positive for coronavirus.

The planemaker said it is providing employees affected by school and childcare closures with \u201ca maximum of flexibility,\" including allowing remote working. Airbus employs 12,700 people in Spain and 48,000 people in France. It also has a significant presence in the United Kingdom and Germany, which is home to 27 of its largest operations employing more than 46,000 people. The company also has facilities in Russia, Turkey, Finland, Poland and Romania. Global aviation has come under intense pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced countries around the world to impose severe travel restrictions. Airlines have seen demand for flights evaporate, and many could now require government bailouts. Malaysia announced its first novel coronavirus death in a statement from the government\u2019s Disaster Management Committee Tuesday. The victim is reported to be a 60-year-old pastor from Emmanuel Baptist Church Kuching in Sarawak. A\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0vaccine trial in the US has now given a dose to its first participant, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced Monday. The study aims to enroll a total of 45 healthy adults over a six-week time frame. Each participant will receive two injections about a month apart in varying doses. There is currently no vaccine for coronavirus. The study, which is a Phase I trial, is meant to establish that the vaccine is safe and induces a desired response from participants' immune systems. Proving that the vaccine is effective in preventing Covid-19 infection, however, will require follow-up studies involving many more participants, which will take many more months, experts say. \"Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with (the novel coronavirus) is an urgent public health priority,\" NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a statement Monday. \"This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\" The agency credited the speed with which it stood up a Phase I trial to its prior studies on related coronaviruses SARS and MERS. Scientists had previously worked on an experimental MERS vaccine targeting a protein on the virus' surface, which gave them a \"head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against Covid-19,\" the statement said.

This means working from home wherever possible and stopping all visits to pubs, clubs, theaters or other venues with immediate effect.\" If residents had family members showing symptoms, the entire household should self-quarantine and not go outside for 14 days, he said. Vulnerable residents like the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions should limit their contact with others. London is the biggest city in Western Europe, with close to 9 million inhabitants.  There have been 1,547 coronavirus cases and 55 deaths in the UK, according to the World Health Organization. The new measures are being implemented because the country is \u201cnow approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve\u201d in cases and \u201cwithout drastic action cases could double every five to six days,\" Johnson has warned. ##Health## ##Daily Life## The numbers:\u00a0As of midnight in Geneva, the World Health Organization has recorded 173,344 coronavirus cases and 7,019 deaths globally.\u00a0 A separate tally from the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the WHO and additional sources, puts the number of cases at over 182,400 with at least 7,100 deaths.

The wristbands, and an accompanying smartphone app, will alert officials if travelers violate the quarantine. Shanghai has listed 12 countries from which arriving travelers would be quarantined for 14 days. \u201cFrom now on, all travelers who have been in\u00a0South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, France, Spain, Germany, the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium will have to self-quarantine for 14 days,\" said a statement from the city's municipal government. Officials had announced the policy on March 3, but didn't publicly name the specific locations. This comes as the number of imported cases from overseas are on the rise -- and as domestic cases of community transmission have drastically fallen. ##Travel## New measures and restrictions will go into effect today in France, limiting people's movements and activities as the country's coronavirus cases continue to spike. All vehicle and pedestrian movements nationwide\u00a0will have to be justified -- meaning \"each person, for each movement, will need to fill a document, stating on their honor, the reason of their movement,\u201d French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said yesterday. Some professions will be able to use their work certificate as proof of justification, and journalists with press cards are allowed to move around \u201cas information plays a major role in the fight against the virus.\" War against coronavirus: The new measures were announced shortly after President Emmanuel Macron said the country was \u201cin a war\u201d against the pandemic, and announced additional measures banning gatherings across\u00a0France -- including family and social gatherings.\u00a0 France has seen dramatic jumps in coronavirus case numbers these past two weeks, reporting hundreds of new cases a day.

The President offered Americans something they have rarely seen from him in his latest and\u00a0most somber press conference yet on the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0on Monday. He dispensed unimpeachable information based on fact. He called for national unity and seemed like he meant to help forge it. And he ditched his normal habit of hyping the best possible outcome to a situation with improbable superlatives -- instead communicating the gravity of a fast-worsening crisis. \"It's bad. It's bad,\" Trump said as he\u00a0unveiled a 15-day plan\u00a0to try to flatten the curve of new infections to alleviate a feared surge of sick patients that could overwhelm the health system. \"Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus,\" Trump said, summoning national resolve as he plunges deeper into a crisis that will now define his term and possibly his reelection hopes. It's a clear change in direction. The President's pivot to seriousness contrasted sharply with some of his previous commentary on the pandemic, which he has compared to the flu and predicted could just go away, and came after he claimed he had\u00a0\"shut it down\"\u00a0and had\u00a0the disease under control. Why it matters: It will take more than one serious news conference to turn the tide of the pandemic -- but it was such an unusual performance that he may stand a chance of shocking watching viewers into action and getting them to fully understand the desolate reality of the coming weeks. Read the full analysis here: A passenger who disembarked a cruise ship in Grand Cayman just over two weeks ago has since died of coronavirus, the Italian cruise company Costa Cruises confirmed to CNN on Monday.\u00a0 In the statement to CNN, Costa Cruises said the passenger was aboard the Costa Luminosa ship, and disembarked in Grand Cayman on February 29. The passenger died on Saturday. Costa Cruises said the man was one of three passengers who tested positive for the virus on the ship, but from two separate journeys. The other two infections -- a husband and wife -- disembarked in Puerto Rico on March 8 from a later Costa cruise journey. The Cayman Islands government had first announced the death on Saturday, saying the 68-year-old patient was the first confirmed coronavirus case in the territory. The patient had preexisting conditions. The man was a \"cardiac patient who was traveling on a cruise ship when he was admitted to Health City in critical condition for urgent cardiac treatment on 29 February,\" said the government statement. The statement added the patient \"had two cardiac arrests and was resuscitated\" on the way to the Cayman Islands, and had a prior medical history of cardiac issues. He was hospitalized upon arrival. ##Travel## There are at least\u00a04,475\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to state and local health agencies and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 70 cases\u00a0are repatriated citizens, like those evacuated from China or the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. 4,405 cases\u00a0were detected, tested, and confirmed in the US.

Singapore imports 90% of the food it consumes and there has been a rush on panic buying in recent weeks, with concerns that the coronavirus pandemic will disrupt the city state's food supplies.  Those fears grew on Monday after Malaysia announced it will impose\u00a0a\u00a0nationwide movement control order that bars citizens from traveling abroad, while foreign tourists and visitors will be restricted from entering the country. Contingency plans and stockpiling: Chan said Singapore has a contingency plan in place for such a scenario and that food stocks will be sufficient.  \"A disruption of supplies from Malaysia is one of the contingency scenarios that we have planned for over the many years,\" he said. \"As such we have plans to manage this contingency with a combination of stockpiling, local production and also diversification of the overseas sources for our supply.\"\n\"This will allow us time to bring alternative supplies should our usual supply lines be disrupted,\" he said.  A religious gathering at a mosque in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur is at the center of a cluster of coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia.  From February 27 to March 1, about 16,000 people attended a four-day \"Ijtima Tabligh\", or religious gathering at the city's Seri Petaling Mosque, according to Malaysia\u2019s health ministry.  About 1,500 of those attendees were foreigners, with many traveling from around the region.

Malaysia: On Monday, Malaysia confirmed 125 new cases in the country, 95 of which are linked to the religious gathering. On Sunday, the country reported 190 new cases, with most of those new infections linked to the meeting, the health ministry said. Malaysia has over 550 cases in total, according to the World Health Organization.

Cambodia: Of 12 new coronavirus cases reported in Cambodia on Monday, 11 are from the religious gathering in Malaysia, according to the country's health ministry and Reuters.  Singapore: 90 people from Singapore were identified as having attending the event, and five of those have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore.

The package represents 4% of the country's GDP, Robertson said. He added that this isn't a one-off measure: \"It is just the beginning. As we go through this crisis towards economic recovery the government will be constantly monitoring the situation and adjusting its response.\" In the statement, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, \"We've gone hard with our health response, and now we're going hard with our financial assistance.\" This comes just days after the government announced that all travelers entering the country, including New Zealand citizens, will have to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. New Zealand currently has 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. ##Business##\u00a0 Egypt has reported its largest spike in daily cases, with 40 more people testing positive and two more deaths, the health ministry announced Monday night. The first death was a 50-year-old Egyptian man, who died in the city of Dakahlia after coming in contact with a woman who last week also died of the virus. The man\u2019s family are currently under quarantine after testing positive for the virus, the health ministry said. The second death was a 72-year-old German man who died in a hospital in Luxor, the health ministry said. Last week, dozens of tourists were quarantined on a cruise boat, also in Luxor, after testing positive for the virus. Egypt now has 166 coronavirus cases with a total of four deaths, the health ministry said. ##Health## When Declan Chan, a stylist based in Hong Kong, flew home from London this week, he was given a wristband to wear upon arrival. It was an electronic band, and would track his movements while he stayed home for 14 days under mandatory quarantine, officials explained. It's the latest preventative measure introduced in the city, which has seen a rise in imported coronavirus cases from overseas in the past two weeks, after a period of slowing infections. The government announced new travel restrictions today, requiring all arriving travelers from foreign countries to undergo the 14-day quarantine. The wristbands, and an accompanying smartphone app, will alert officials if travelers violate the quarantine. Chan said he was instructed to download the smartphone app, and to walk around his apartment once he arrived home, so that it could map his premises. \"So far, 5,000 reusable wristbands produced by the (technology) centre are readily available and another 60,000 disposable wristbands have been procured from the market, 5,000 of which were delivered and tested and the remaining 55,000 will be delivered in batches,\" said the government in a statement yesterday. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Travel## Pakistan reported today that the country has 184 cases of the coronavirus -- more than three times the number reported just two days ago. On Sunday, the national tally was 53 cases. And just the day before that, the tally was 28. Many of the newly reported cases in these recent spikes have come from pilgrims who were retested in their home districts after already being quarantined two weeks ago at the Iran-Pakistan border. Pakistan has shut down schools, cinemas, and courts, but public transportation and places of business still remain largely operational. On Friday, Pakistan also shut its borders with Iran and Afghanistan. ##Health## New York City is usually packed and busy around this time of year. It's finally the beginning of spring; the streets, parks, and restaurants are usually full of people, even on a weeknight. Instead, on Monday night, restaurants and cafes were empty as people stayed home. \u201cIt was a difficult walk around my neighborhood tonight,\u201d resident Ben Von Klemperer told CNN. \n\u201dSome of these are my usual after-work spots, and they hold a lot of good memories. I really hope they can pull through.\u201d Many of the stores and cafes were closed, with signs on the doors saying they would reopen at a later point. Even the restaurants that were still open were mostly empty and eerie. Outside, there were few people on the street -- perhaps a sign that New Yorkers are listening to health officials' pleas for social distancing. ##Daily Life## ##Business## As restaurants, shops,\u00a0airlines\u00a0and\u00a0factories\u00a0shut\u00a0down around the world, economists are warning that a\u00a0global recession\u00a0is no longer a looming threat. It's here. Dire economic data released by China on Monday showed that the country was\u00a0pummeled by the coronavirus outbreak\u00a0in January and February. The world's second biggest economy\u00a0looks unlikely to recover any time soon. Now, with governments\u00a0and central banks in Europe and North America pursuing drastic measures to try to control the pandemic, Asia still on high alert, and\u00a0financial markets in meltdown, a growing number of experts say that a global contraction is beginning. \"Whereas 10 days ago there was some legitimate uncertainty about whether the global economy was in the process of going into recession -- 10 days later, there's no question that it is,\" David Wilcox, former head of research and statistics at the Federal Reserve Board, told CNN Business. Chinese economy slammed: In China, retail sales plunged 20.5% during January and February compared to 2019, industrial output was down 13.5%, and fixed asset investment fell by nearly 25%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The decline in industrial production was the sharpest contraction on record. The US forecast: Goldman Sachs on Sunday downgraded its outlook for US GDP, citing a cutback in spending, supply chain disruptions and the impact of local quarantines. The investment bank thinks America's economy will now shrink 5% between April and June, after 0% growth between January and March. Growth for the year is forecast to come in at just 0.4%, down from 1.2%.

Jayde Powell, an 20-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, is providing free grocery delivery to the sick and elderly with a growing army of volunteers. She got the idea to organize a few volunteers when her mother mentioned calling elderly neighbors to see whether they needed anything. \"As a pre-med student, I know that people who are older or people who have heart, lung or immune conditions are especially at risk for contracting the virus,\" Powell told CNN. She started \"Shopping Angels\" by enlisting about 20 members of her medical fraternity, Phi Delta Epsilon. As need grew, she reached out to other classmates and turned to social media to recruit more. But Powell credits her interview with CNN affiliate\u00a0KVVU\u00a0for putting Shopping Angels on the national scene. \"It is really quite astonishing to me,\" she said. \"I woke up this morning to 20 voicemails and 56 emails. And I've got people in Connecticut, Long Island, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Arizona that want to volunteer.\" How it works: Some clients give their angel a shopping list, budget and money to cover the purchase. Other clients purchase their groceries online, and a shopping angel does the pickup. Powell requires her shopping angels to wear masks and gloves during transportation, pickup and delivery. Additionally, Powell asks her volunteers not to go inside the homes for the safety of everyone involved.

The patient, a woman identified by her surname, Li, is a resident of Massachusetts, said Beijing authorities in a statement online. She had attended a company conference in late February, where one of her colleagues later tested positive for the coronavirus.  The timeline: Li began noticing symptoms on March 1, like muscle aches, a fever, cough, and runny nose. She visited a local hospital on March 3, before subsequent visits on March 5, March 10, and March 11; she was prescribed antiviral medication and given a chest radiograph, but says she was not hospitalized. Finally, on March 12, she traveled to Los Angeles, then flew onward to Beijing with her husband and son.  On the flight: A few hours after takeoff, Li told flight crew that she was experiencing symptoms. She was asked to sit in an isolation zone on the plane, and wear a mask. It wasn't for several more hours -- shortly before arriving in Beijing -- that she told crew members she had been at a conference with a person infected with coronavirus, according to an airline spokesperson. Upon arrival, the family was taken to a hospital in Beijing, where Li was confirmed infected with the virus on March 13. She is now being treated in hospital while her husband and son stay under quarantine for medical observation. But in the past week, contradicting claims have emerged. Nieng Yan, a professor at Princeton University, said on the social platform Weibo that Li had already tested positive in the US and had wanted to \"escape\" back to China -- contradicting Li's claims that she had been unable to get tested in Massachusetts. The police say they are investigating Li for alleged violation of China's infectious disease prevention law. The Indian film industry is halting all productions from March 19-31 as part of efforts to contain the novel coronavirus in the country.  \u201cThe health and safety of our colleagues comes first, hence we completely support the industry\u2019s united decision to suspend productions,\u201d Kulmeet Makkar, CEO of the Producers Guild of\u00a0India,\u00a0said in a statement.\n\u201cIn the coming days, we will discuss details with our members on the modalities of postponing our production plans, keeping in mind the ongoing threat of Covid-19.

And actress Priyanka Chopra took to\u00a0Instagram\u00a0to promote the traditional Indian greeting of Namaste as a safe, no-contact way of greeting.\u00a0 A\u00a0Delta Air Lines flight was held before takeoff Monday in New York after a passenger said they were exposed to someone who had tested positive for\u00a0coronavirus, a person involved with airport operations told CNN. Flight 2503 was scheduled to fly from JFK Airport to Seattle that night. Just before takeoff, the individual was told that they were exposed to someone with coronavirus, the source said. The passenger\u00a0did not show any symptoms\u00a0but deplaned out of an abundance of caution, the source said. \"The passenger is being questioned, the information is being supplied to the CDC. They will make a decision what becomes of this flight and the rest of us,\" the pilot announced to passengers on the flight. \"So at this point, all I can say is just please be patient as we work through this and figure it out. We'll give you as much information as we know, as soon as we know it.\" Delta confirmed the incident and said that the plane was being cleaned. \"We continue to follow all guidelines from the CDC and local health officials,\" Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo told CNN. \"The safety and health of our customers and crew remain our top priority.\" Read the full story here. ##Travel## One of Hollywood's most famous couples is helping feed those in need during the coronavirus pandemic.

Almost 6.5 million people visited the Taj Mahal in 2018, according to statistics from the Indian Ministry of Tourism. This is just the latest restriction in India: The country has\u00a0suspended issuing any new tourist visas\u00a0and is enforcing a two-week quarantine on all travelers -- including returning Indian nationals -- who are arriving from or have visited China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain. \"The scale and extent of our interventions have increased in alignment with the evolving situation of COVID-19 [coronavirus] across the world, and India in particular,\" Harsh Vardhan, India's Minister of Health, told\u00a0reporters earlier this month. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in India stands at 114, including two deaths. ##Travel## There are now more deaths from the novel coronavirus outside mainland China than inside the country.  That's a significant moment in the evolution of the pandemic, which for months has been concentrated in China -- the country where the virus was first discovered at the end of last year. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Tuesday that the national death toll was 3,226. The Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and additional sources, puts the global death toll at 7,154 \u2013 with 3,924 deaths outside of China. That's nearly 700 more deaths outside of China than inside. The WHO\u2019s latest global death toll stands at 6,610. It lists the China death toll at 3,218, with 3,392 deaths outside China, or at least 174 more deaths outside China than inside. Italy, which has the largest outbreak outside of mainland China, has reported 2,158 deaths. Iran has reported 853 and Spain 342, according to Johns Hopkins. Cases around the world continue to accelerate and Europe has become the new epicenter of the pandemic.  The milestone in the death toll will undoubtedly raise questions about whether national health care services are prepared for the increased caseloads and the availability of supplies and protective gear for front line health workers. It's also likely to focus attention on whether governments are doing enough to stop the spread of the virus.  In Asia, countries that acted quickly with a combination of aggressive containment and social distancing measures have seen their caseloads stabilize in recent weeks.  But there are concerns that some countries in Europe and North America are not acting fast enough to stop their own epidemics -- and prevent more deaths. The UK, for example, is seen as an outlier in Europe, as its response has been less strict than its European counterparts, prompting criticism at home and overseas. ##Health## Tens of millions of people\u00a0in Southeast Asia have had their movements, travel and daily life restricted as countries prepare for a surge in\u00a0novel coronavirus cases. In Malaysia, residents are banned from traveling abroad, while foreign tourists and visitors will be restricted from entering the country, according to the state-run Bernama News Agency. The control order, which will start Wednesday and last until the end of the month, bans all religious, sports, social, and cultural activities, Bernama reported. All houses of worship and business premises will be closed, except for grocery stores, and schools will be closed until the end of the month. In the Philippines, half the country -- about 50 million people -- is under an \"enhanced community quarantine.\" Luzon, the Philippines' largest and most populous island, has effectively been locked down. All mass public transportation has been suspended, and residents told they can only leave their homes for essential items,\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines. Offices have been shut. Only essential businesses like supermarkets and hospitals are allowed to open.  From Tuesday midnight local time, people have 72 hours to leave the island if they wish, after which all air travel to Luzon will be restricted. Enforcing the new measures will be a 70,000-strong police force on Luzon and anyone violating the quarantine may face arrest, CNN Philippines reported.

Mainland China -- where the pandemic began at the end of last year -- has recorded 3,226 coronavirus-related deaths, according to the country's National Health Commission. The Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources, puts the global death toll at 7,138 \u2013 which would mean 3,912 deaths outside of mainland China -- nearly 700 more deaths outside of China than inside. The World Health Organisation\u2019s latest global death toll stands at 6,610. They list the China death toll at 3,218, with 3,392 deaths outside China, or at least 174 more deaths outside China than inside so far. ##Health## South Korea has expanded its special immigration measures to cover all arrivals starting Thursday, the country's health ministry announced during a news conference. The new policies will require all visitors regardless of the port of origin to undergo a one-on-one temperature check when entering the country, it said. Those exhibiting symptoms will be required to take a diagnostic test and quarantine for two weeks.\u00a0 All visitors will also be required to confirm their local addresses and phone numbers, and install a self-diagnosis app on their smartphones before they are allowed entry. In Japan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also raised its outbound travel advisories for several European countries amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. The highest warning, which advises citizens not to travel, has been issued for all of Iceland, as well as some provinces of Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. The ministry currently also advises its citizens not to make non-essential trips to other continental European countries. ##Travel## As Chinese President Xi Jinping passed an apartment complex last week during\u00a0his tour of Wuhan, he looked up and waved back at rows of residents who -- still under lockdown -- greeted him behind masks from their apartment windows. The upbeat footage -- beamed into millions of homes across China later that evening -- was meant to send a confident message that, under Xi's leadership, the country had\u00a0turned a corner. But for many Wuhan residents, the images on state media do not match with the reality of day-to-day life. \"What's for sure is that Xi Jinping cannot hear any genuine voices at all,\" said resident Zhang Yi. Zhang, and many others like him, have been sealed off from the outside world since late January, when the metropolis of 11 million was placed under a state-imposed lockdown to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus -- and their frustrations have been mounting. Anger at the government: When the epidemic was at its most severe, many Wuhan patients said they were unable to get treated due to an\u00a0extreme shortage\u00a0of hospital beds and medical resources.  Now, as the number of new reported cases in China\u00a0slows to a trickle, millions of residents are still\u00a0restricted by the government\u00a0to their homes; they're not even allowed to go outside to shop for groceries. Instead, the residents CNN spoke to said they have to rely on designated neighborhood committees to make group orders for daily necessities -- often at a higher price. While state media has doubled down on constructing a positive narrative of life in Wuhan, the deep well of public anger resulting from stringent censorship, soaring food prices and the failures of the local government is starting to chip away at the propaganda facade. Read the full story here: ##Daily Life## Top health care officials in the US warned today that the country doesn't have enough stockpiled medical equipment like masks and gloves to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services told medical professionals on a conference call today that there was not enough personal protective equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile to fulfill anticipated gaps in state and local supplies, according to a source who was on the call. These crucial equipment include masks, gowns and gloves. The call was confirmed to CNN by a Department of Health and Human Services official. The officials said on the call that the government didn't yet have a solution for the looming shortfall, but was working on one. \"We have been transparent that more supplies are needed -- hence the request to Congress for additional funding so we could procure more and scale up production,\" an HHS spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.  The role of the national stockpile is to fill the gap temporarily until states and localities working with the private sector can respond to the state and local needs. ##Health## Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said today that\u00a0he \"secured support\" from G7 leaders to hold the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in their \"complete form,\u201d which would provide \"proof that the world has contained coronavirus.\" Speaking to reporters\u00a0in Tokyo after a teleconference with the G7 leaders, Abe said he had called for cooperation to develop a vaccine, and that the member nations had agreed to take steps to cope with the severe economic impact. Abe was not drawn on the timeframe of the Olympics, when asked by reporters if there could be a delay. Pressure to cancel: Japan's government has faced calls to cancel the Olympics for weeks, but have insisted that preparations are continuing as planned.  Just last week, the Tokyo governor said canceling the Olympics would be \"unthinkable.\" Tokyo 2020 is due to officially begin on Friday, July 24. ##Business## One of the biggest nights on the fashion calendar, the Met Gala, has been postponed due to the coronavirus. The news follows a wave of canceled and postponed cultural events around the world.  The annual red carpet event, hosted by Cond\u00e9 Nast's Anna Wintour, is a celebrity-packed fundraiser for The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Since 2005, the event has been held, without fail, on the first Monday in May -- it also marks the launch of its spring exhibition. This year's exhibition,\u00a0\"About Time: Fashion and Duration,\"\u00a0is sponsored by luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton. It had originally been scheduled for May 4, 2020.  \"Due to the unavoidable and responsible decision by the Metropolitan Museum to close its doors, About Time, and the opening night gala, will be postponed to a later date,\"\u00a0wrote Wintour on Vogue.com. On Friday, the Metropolitan Museum announced it would be shutting its doors temporarily, causing speculation that the gala would not be held as planned.  In a follow up statement sent to CNN on Monday a spokesperson wrote: \"The Museum will remain closed through Saturday, April 4. Additionally, the CDC advised over the weekend that there should not be any gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. In deference to this guidance, all programs and events through May 15 will be canceled or postponed.\" Read more here. ##Business## As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the US, fitness centers and clubs are responding with closures and waivers. The Life Time chain of fitness clubs, based in Minnesota, is closing all of its locations, effective immediately, said the company on Monday. Life Time has\u00a0more than 150 destinations in 41 major markets in the US and Canada. The company said it will update its members on a reopening date as soon as possible. LA Fitness gyms will also be closed nationwide from today through at least April 1, in an effort to help \"flatten the curve and impact of this virus,\" the company announced in a letter to its members today. All memberships will be extended to cover the time the clubs are closed, LA Fitness said in the letter. Maintenance and janitorial crews will remain on duty. LA Fitness has more than 700 clubs across the United States and Canada. Meanwhile, fitness apps and organizations like Classpass, which partner with different gyms and sports venues, are offering members special measures like the option to \"pause\" their accounts, or waived cancelation fees. ##Daily Life## ##Business## India\u00a0is banning all travelers from the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom from midnight Wednesday local time, the\u00a0Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said. Airlines will be prohibited from boarding any passengers from these countries -- including\u00a0Indian nationals -- at the first port of departure.\u00a0 Passengers from these countries returning to\u00a0India\u00a0before the ban takes effect will be immediately quarantined for 14 days. The country has also expanded its compulsory quarantine measures for 14 days to all passengers transiting or coming through the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait from Wednesday. The measures will be in place until March 31 and will be reviewed subsequently. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in\u00a0India\u00a0stands at 114, including two deaths. \u00a0 Factories were shuttered and streets were cleared across China's Hubei province as authorities ordered residents to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. It seems the lockdown had an unintended benefit -- blue skies. The average number of \"good quality air days\" increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period last year, according to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment. And Hubei wasn't alone. Satellite images by NASA\u00a0and the European Space Agency show a dramatic reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions -- those released by vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities -- in major Chinese cities between January and February. The visible cloud of toxic gas hanging over industrial powerhouses almost disappeared. \"This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,\" says Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize the spread of the virus.\" Coal consumption dropped dramatically. Major coal-fired power stations saw huge drops in consumption, likely because electricity demand is down. Burning fossil fuels like coal emits carbon dioxide -- and emissions were down by at least 25% from February 3 to March 1, according to air pollution research group Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). But some are worried that once the coronavirus threat passes, China will be solely focused on restarting its economy,\u00a0and the pollution will return in full force.

Washington and New York are the hardest hit states, both with more than 900 cases. California follows with 448 cases. Only one state has yet to report a coronavirus case -- West Virginia. There have been 87 coronavirus-related deaths in the US. ##Health## The US stores Foot Locker and Nordstrom both announced temporary closures today due to the coronavirus pandemic. The shoe store Foot Locker will close all stores in North America, from Tuesday through March 31, said the company in a statement. Customers can still shop online and on the store's app. Employees will also continue to be paid, said the statement. Meanwhile, Nordstrom is also closing US and Canada stores for two weeks, effective Tuesday. These include its multiple brands like Nordstrom Rack, Trunk Club, and Jeffrey. Employees will continue to be paid and receive benefits during the closures. \u201cThe health and safety of our customers and employees remain our top priority as we continue to make decisions during this rapidly evolving situation,\u201d said\u00a0CEO Erik Nordstrom in a statement. ##Business## Texas has reported its first coronavirus-related death.\u00a0\u00a0 The patient was a male resident of Matagorda County in his late 90s. He died Sunday evening at Matagorda Regional Medical Center \"with symptoms consistent with Covid-19,\" said a news release from the hospital. The statement also announced a second positive case in the county. The state is now investigating this second case, and have informed the hospital district that \"evidence exists of a possible community link to the earlier positive case in Matagorda County.\u201d\u00a0 Texas now has 57 cases and one death from the coronavirus. ##Health## Google will delay the rollout of an informational coronavirus website until later this week, instead of a Monday launch date, the company said. \"With local and national guidance evolving rapidly, Google will continue working with relevant agencies and authorities to roll out a website later this week that will surface authoritative information for people in the US, including on screening and testing,\u201d Google said in a statement. What the website will not have: Despite the reference to screening and testing, Google still does not appear to be developing a nationwide tool to directly survey patients for their symptoms and guide them to testing sites, as the Trump administration has claimed in recent days.\u00a0 What it will have: The website is expected to display information about how Americans can access screening, and list other information about local testing sites. It will also include a link to the CDC's own screening tool, which is under development.\u00a0 Why the rollout is delayed: Google says it's still waiting on more information about local testing sites.  Don't get confused: Google's sister company Verily also just launched a website that guides Californian users to testing locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Verily has said it hopes to expand its tool, but has not issued a timeframe for its deployment.\u00a0 The two websites were the subject of great confusion after President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence announced that Google is working on a tool that will direct Americans to local testing sites. But Google\u2019s announcement, including its remarks Monday evening, stop short of meeting that description.\u00a0 ##Business## Qantas Airways is slashing international flights by 90% until at least May, as coronavirus travel restrictions hammer bookings. The Australian carrier said on Tuesday that the drastic reduction is because severe quarantine requirements are curbing people\u2019s ability to travel overseas.  Qantas will also cut domestic capacity by about 60%. An industry in crisis: The unprecedented travel restrictions and plunge in demand has prompted the worst aviation crisis in history. A growing number of countries, including the United States and Canada, are closing their borders to international travelers in an effort to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Government officials around the world are also urging citizens to avoid any non-essential travel and advising people to cancel or postpone events, such as concerts, sports, and even weddings.\u00a0 Billions at stake: Global airlines stand to lose $113 billion in sales if the coronavirus continues to spread, according to the latest assessment from the International Air Transport Association. The massive losses are prompting industry bodies to call on governments to help. \"Coordinated government and industry action is needed \u2014 now \u2014 if catastrophe is to be avoided,\" CAPA Centre for Aviation, a consultancy, said in a report published\u00a0Monday.  The firm said most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May unless governments intervene. \"Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded, and what flights there are operate much less than half full.\u201d Last month, when the virus was still largely affecting the Asia-Pacific region, Qantas had already warned the coronavirus outbreak could reduce its profit by up to 150 million Australian dollars ($91.7 million) in the second half of its fiscal year. The carrier's dramatic cuts to international flights on Tuesday is up from the 23% reduction it had announced just last week -- Qantas said that the plunge in demand and flight cuts will be felt across the business. The carrier, which employs 30,000 people, said it will roll out paid and unpaid leave. The company had previously said its CEO and chairman would receive three months of no pay. ##Business## Microsoft is closing all of its stores globally, effective immediately, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. \"We know families, remote workers and businesses are under unique pressure at this time, and we are still here to serve you online at Microsoft.com,\" said Microsoft Store in a statement on Twitter. ##Business## The numbers: As of 4 p.m in Geneva on Monday, the World Health Organization has recorded 168,019 coronavirus cases and 6,610 deaths globally.
