Buttigieg calls for Attorney General Barr to resign Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that he believes Attorney General Bill Barr should resign because of his handling of politically sensitive cases like that of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Buttigieg said about Barr stepping down. \u201cThis really is an emergency,\u00a0it's an emergency of legitimacy\u00a0in our justice system.\u00a0Our justice system only works if\u00a0it is immune from the\u00a0interference of politicians. Buttigieg to Trump: \"My marriage\u2026 never involved\u00a0me having to send hush money to a porn\u00a0star\" Pete Buttigieg excoriated Donald Trump and one of his most high-profile supporters for questioning his marriage to his husband, Chasten, on Tuesday, telling an audience in Las Vegas that his marriage\u00a0\u201cnever involved\u00a0me having to send hush money to a porn\u00a0star.\u201d Buttigieg is referring to $130,000 in payments arranged by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen,\u00a0to Stephanie Clifford, a porn star known as Stormy Daniels who says she and Trump had an affair in 2006 after Trump married his wife Melania. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, but admitted in 2018 that he knew of the payments \"later on.\" Klobuchar says she's glad Bloomberg will be on debate stage Amy Klobuchar said she\u2019s glad Michael Bloomberg will be on stage for the upcoming Democratic debate Wednesday night in Nevada.\u00a0 \u201cI actually thought he should be on the debate stage because I don\u2019t think you should just be able to buy your way to the presidency,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Klobuchar attributes not knowing the Mexican president\u2019s name to long day Amy Klobuchar sought to explain her inability to name the president of Mexico in an interview last week by pointing to a long day of campaigning and Senate votes. Klobuchar also looked to fire back at Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday after the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor used the misstep to question the Minnesota senator\u2019s Washington experience. \u201cWhen that happened, for what\u00a0it's worth, I had been in the\u00a0Senate all day.\u00a0We had six votes, including a resolution to be\u00a0a check on the president,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd I got on a plane and got\u00a0there at midnight my time and had a fast interview and two\u00a0forums after that, I think ending at about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. Such is life.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, who before running for Senate worked as county attorney for Minnesota\u2019s largest county, defended her criminal justice record on Tuesday, telling voters in Nevada that \u201canyone that's worked in the\u00a0criminal justice system knows\u00a0there's institutional racism.\u201d The issue is a growing one for Klobuchar: Her rise in the Democratic nominating process has coincided with more scrutiny on her record as county attorney\u00a0for\u00a0Hennepin County, including the case of Myon Burrell, a teenager who was sentenced to life for the killing of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards but now, with the backing of new evidence, insists he is innocent. \u201cOver the years, I think we have\u00a0seen just how devastating that\u00a0is,\u201d Klobuchar said of racism in the judicial system. \u201cAnd when I was there, I worked hard\u00a0on, for instance, doing more when\u00a0it came to white collar crime, doing more with drug courts.\u00a0And while here were still disparities in\u00a0our system, like there were any, we had still managed\u00a0in the eight years to reduce the\u00a0African-American incarceration\u00a0rate by 12%.\u201d Klobuchar said \u201cthere's still more to be\u00a0done,\u201d but ticked through changes she made during her time as county attorney, including racially involved\u00a0misidentification, DNA review, and diversifying police department and prosecutors\u2019 offices. \u201cI just think we have to come to grips\u00a0with the fact that while we must\u00a0keep our community safe. You can\u00a0do that at the same time you get at the institutional\u00a0racism that we have in the\u00a0criminal justice system,\u201d Klobuchar said. Issues of racism and policing could be particularly damaging for Klobuchar, who has consistently shown little ability to win over black voters. Watch: Amy Klobuchar sought to explain her inability to name the president of Mexico in an interview last week by pointing to a long day of campaigning and Senate votes. Klobuchar also looked to fire back at Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday after the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor used the misstep to question the Minnesota senator\u2019s Washington experience. \u201cWhen that happened, for what\u00a0it's worth, I had been in the\u00a0Senate all day.\u00a0We had six votes, including a resolution to be\u00a0a check on the president,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd I got on a plane and got\u00a0there at midnight my time and had a fast interview and two\u00a0forums after that, I think ending at about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. Such is life.\u201d Klobuchar\u00a0and\u00a0Tom Steyer\u00a0both couldn't name the president of Mexico when asked during a\u00a0Telemundo interview\u00a0while campaigning in Nevada last week. Klobuchar offered a simple \"no\" when asked whether she knew President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Buttigieg correctly answered the question. On Sunday, Buttigieg hit Klobuchar for her inability to answer the question, telling a crowd of supporters in Las Vegas it shows \"that there is more to being prepared than how many years you spent in Washington.\" Klobuchar responded to the knock, stating, \u201cI would say to the mayor,\u00a0this isn't like a game of\u00a0'Jeopardy!'.\u201d \u201cThis is about, to me, experience\u00a0and I have so much respect for\u00a0him and his experience, but my experience is different,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI have been in the Senate.\u00a0I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat. I think that matters. And most importantly, I have been able to win in rural\u00a0and suburban districts.\u201d She concluded: \u201cI think that's really important\u00a0right now, that we build this coalition, that we not shut people out.\u00a0I know he agrees with me on\u00a0that, but I am the one that actually has\u00a0the receipts of anyone that\u00a0you'll see on the debate stage\u00a0tomorrow night that's done it.\u00a0So, it is just a different experience.\u201d Watch the moment: Amy Klobuchar has a message for female voters who want to elect a woman to the White House. \"I know it would be cool to be the first woman president, believe me, and I think a lot of women out there know exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\" she said, \"but I think that the story that we tell and the campaign that we run has\u00a0to be more than about that. It has to be about people\u2019s dreams.\" Asked what it said about the US that it had not yet broken that barrier, Klobuchar reminded viewers that Hillary Clinton \"did get the most votes\" in 2016. \"Let's remember that,\" she said. \"I think people are ready for it.\" But Klobuchar also indicated that she would not make the historic nature of her candidacy the centerpiece of her campaign. \"I was the first woman in both jobs I had, as a county attorney as a woman senator from my state. I didn\u2019t really talk about it much back then (when she first ran for the Senate) because women had tried to run for the US Senate in (Minnesota) twice and they were both really qualified and they didn\u2019t make it,\" she said. \"There had been a lot of emphasis on 'put the first woman in,'\" Klobuchar said of that race. \"That wasn\u2019t enough of a reason. I had to show I had the experience and I had to have a plan of what I wanted to get done. And I made that really clear throughout the campaign. And I think that\u2019s really important in this race, as well.\" Klobuchar did speak earlier about other women's issues, like pushing for universal childcare and, if elected, working to get the Equal Rights Amendment over the line.  Hear Sen. Klobuchar's comments: Amy Klobuchar said she\u2019s glad Michael Bloomberg will be on stage for the upcoming Democratic debate Wednesday night in Nevada.\u00a0 \u201cI actually thought he should be on the debate stage because I don\u2019t think you should just be able to buy your way to the presidency,\u201d she said.\u00a0 The Minnesota senator criticized Bloomberg for skipping the trudge through town halls, meeting with voters, and rolling out policies in the early-voting states, saying \u201cthat\u2019s what a presidential candidate should do.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe want to make sure that you have the best candidate to lead the ticket, and I don\u2019t think that when people look at Donald Trump, they automatically say, \u2019Hmm, can we get someone richer?\u2019\u201d Klobuchar said.\u00a0 \u201cI think they say, \u2018We want to have someone that we know can lead this country,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s me.\u201d\u00a0 Watch the moment: Pete Buttigieg recalled a time he tried to use his foreign language skills to help a family caught up in the middle of a protest.\u00a0 The former mayor speaks eight languages \u2014 \u201csome better than others,\u201d he said at a CNN town hall \u2014 including Norwegian, Maltese, Arabic, Spanish and Dari.\u00a0 The day Trump\u2019s travel ban went into effect, Buttigieg said he was in Houston and decided to participate in a protest at an airport against the ban. Within a few hours, he said there were hundreds of people at the protest. Buttigieg, who was running to be the chair of the Democratic National Committee at the time, said he had heard a rumor there was an Iranian family that was not being allowed through because of the ban.\u00a0 \u201cThis family started coming\u00a0through, and they were being mobbed by TV\u00a0reporters, and I realized that they may\u00a0not have had any idea of why\u00a0there were all these protesters\u00a0or cameras or anything,\u201d Buttigieg said.\u00a0 Buttigieg went up to the family and tried to communicate with the them in Dari, which he said is similar to Farsi. He said he learned Dari when he was deploying to Afghanistan.\u00a0 \u201cI see this man emerge, kind of Middle Eastern appearance, his wife is in a hijab, they\u2019ve got three or four little kids, a bunch of suitcases, they look exhausted,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I went up to them and\u00a0started to ask, you know, are you okay?\u00a0Do you know what's happening? Do you need any help?\u00a0Everybody\u2019s here to support you.\u201d \u201cAnd the more I tried to say this in\u00a0Farsi, the clearer it became\u00a0that he didn\u2019t understand me at all,\u201d Buttigieg said. He then realized the man spoke Arabic, which Buttigieg studied in college, so the former mayor tried to communicate with him in that language.\u00a0 \u201cHe had no idea what was going on. He was actually Jordanian, and he just\u00a0wanted to go home,\u201d Buttigieg said.\u00a0 \u201cBecause I'm wearing a tie, the\u00a0reporters from one of the local\u00a0TV stations think that I\u2019m his\u00a0lawyer, and they start interviewing me.\u00a0And one of them was from\u00a0Telemundo, which was in Spanish,\u00a0and they were asking me to try to ask him questions in Arabic, which I\u2019m not that good at, and they were asking me in Spanish, and it was a real mess,\u201d he said.\u00a0 He said in the end, Buttigieg grabbed the luggage cart and helped the family get out of the protest and to the garage where someone was waiting to pick them up.\u00a0 Hear the story: Pete Buttigieg excoriated Donald Trump and one of his most high-profile supporters for questioning his marriage to his husband, Chasten, on Tuesday, telling an audience in Las Vegas that his marriage \u201cnever involved\u00a0me having to send hush money to a porn\u00a0star.\u201d Buttigieg is referring to $130,000 in payments arranged by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to Stephanie Clifford, a porn star known as Stormy Daniels who says she and Trump had an affair in 2006 after Trump married his wife Melania. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, but admitted in 2018 that he knew of the payments \"later on.\" The comments also come days after radio host Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that American voters are \u201cstill not ready to elect a gay guy kissing his husband on the debate stage president.\u201d Limbaugh said on Tuesday that Trump, who initially responded to the host\u2019s comments by saying he would not be uncomfortable with a gay president, told him to \u201cnever apologize\u201d for his comments about Buttigieg. \u201cThe idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values,\u201d Buttigieg said, before pausing for cheers and applause. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse, with him or her,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cSo, if they want to debate family values, let's debate family values, I'm ready.\u201d Buttigieg also said he did not take Trump at his word because \"he's sending out his supporters to talk in that way.\" Watch: Pete Buttigieg has routinely spoken about his Christian faith during these events and, again on Tuesday night, argued that religion should not be viewed as the province of any one political party. Asked whether he believed it was possible to be a Christian and support Trump, he said it wasn\u2019t his place \u201cto tell other Christians how to be Christians.\u201d \u201cBut I will say,\u201d he added, \u201cthat I can\u2019t find any compatibility between the way this President conducts himself and anything I find in Scripture.\u201d Buttigieg also said that his faith would help guide his policy decisions in office. \u201cThe time has come to send a message: that people of faith have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you belong to a Christian, or any moral or religious tradition, that emphasizes making yourself useful to the oppressed and standing with and identifying with the prisoner, welcoming the stranger -- stranger by the way is another word for immigrant -- yes, that has implications in public life.\u201d  Watch the moment: Pete Buttigieg said Tuesday that while he would accept Michael Bloomberg\u2019s donations should he become the Democratic nominee, he does believe the former New York mayor is trying to buy the nomination by spending hundreds of millions on ads. When CNN's Erin Burnett asked Buttigieg if he believes \u201ctrying to buy the democratic\u00a0nomination for president,\u201d the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI mean, what else do you call\u00a0it,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWhat else do you call it when\u00a0you dip into your reserves of\u00a0millions and billions and don't\u00a0go through the process of\u00a0campaigning in states like\u00a0Nevada, Iowa or New Hampshire, going into the diners and the\u00a0backyards, looking eye to eye?\u201d Buttigieg has recently started to attack Bloomberg on the campaign trail, telling an audience in Las Vegas on Tuesday that Bloomberg is \u201ca billionaire who thinks that you... can just buy your way on to television and win that way.\u201d The former New York mayor qualified for Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate on Tuesday. Buttigieg did separate himself from Bernie Sanders during his CNN town hall by saying that if he were to win the party\u2019s nomination, he would accept the billionaire\u2019s support. \u201cSure,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThis is the moment to bring everybody that we can into this effort, and I promise exactly one thing in return for any contribution, which is, we're going to take that contribution and use it to go beat Donald Trump.\u201d Hear more: Pete Buttigieg argued that his public option health insurance plan had a better chance of surviving in Congress than Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" proposal.  The reason: choice. \"This is where I part ways with my friend Sen. Sanders. He believes that we should require everybody to adopt that plan, whether they want to or not,\" Buttigieg said, before name-checking a powerful local union. \"There\u2019s a lot of folks here in the state of Nevada, culinary workers come to mind, who negotiated for good private plans \u2026 Who are we to tell them they have to give it up?\u201d Buttigieg made the case that a drastic expansion of public health insurance was within reach, as long as Americans don't feel like they're being forced to make the change. \u201cWe have a powerful American majority ready to support this reform, what I\u2019m talking about -- creating a public plan for everybody, just as long as we don\u2019t kick people off of their private plans,\" he said. Buttigieg also challenged the for-profit health insurance industry, which has been critical of his public option plan, to beat it.  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to the private players to figure out if they can measure up,\" he said. Watch: Pete Buttigieg tied his military experience to the active shooter drills students in schools are now involved in Tuesday night after being asked about ending gun violence in schools by an educator in the Las Vegas area.\u00a0 \u201cI'm thinking about terms like dispersion of targets and the difference between cover and concealment -- things I learned as part of military training,\u201d the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor said.\u00a0 \u201cPart of why I believed I was in the military to serve potentially in conflict zones so that kids at schools in America would never have to have that experience. And to see what we are accepting, in terms of the expectation that this is just normal -- that kids are going to have active shooter drills, sometimes before they're old enough to learn how to read -- shows you this country has its priorities wrong,\u201d Buttigieg said.\u00a0 He quickly added, \u201cActually, no -- Washington has its priorities wrong.\u201d\u00a0 Hear Buttigieg\u2019s comments: Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that he believes Attorney General Bill Barr should resign because of his handling of politically sensitive cases like that of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Buttigieg said about Barr stepping down. \u201cThis really is an emergency,\u00a0it's an emergency of legitimacy\u00a0in our justice system.\u00a0Our justice system only works if\u00a0it is immune from the\u00a0interference of politicians. President Donald Trump has denied that he pushed Barr to intervene in the Stone case, where top DOJ officials reduced the recommended sentence against the Trump adviser. That led all four federal prosecutors who took the case to trial to withdraw. Late last week, Barr also\u00a0ordered a re-examination\u00a0of several high-profile cases, including that of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \u201cThis president, especially now that he feels emboldened after getting away with what he got away with during the impeachment process, thinks he can just lean in and ask others to do the same and interfere,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd one of the first criteria for my attorney general, is that she or he will understand that she or he is the lawyer for the American people and not the personal lawyer of the president of the United States.\u201d Watch the moment: Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has taken the stage. CNN's Erin Burnett is moderating. Bernie Sanders dismissed a question about whether he is the Democratic frontrunner. \u201cWho cares,\u201d Sanders said. The Vermont senator delivered a strong performance in Iowa and then won the New Hampshire primary, leading many within the Democratic Party to believe he has not supplanted former Vice President Joe Biden as the party\u2019s frontrunner. Sanders is also atop a number of recently released national polls. Sanders, though, has little interest in whether he was atop the field. \u201cI know we take no votes for\u00a0granted.\u00a0We are a hardworking campaign.\u00a0We're so appreciative of the\u00a0hundreds of thousands of\u00a0volunteers we have,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can tell you, we're working\u00a0right now in Nevada trying to\u00a0bring out the vote.\u201d Hear Sen. Sanders' response: Late last December, three months after he suffered a heart attack in Las Vegas, Bernie Sanders released three letters from physicians attesting to his good health. On Tuesday night, Sanders said that if the public wants any more information about his health, they should join him on the campaign trail, where he keeps a busy schedule. Sanders argued that the letters, including one from the attending physician at the US Capitol, amounted to a \"detailed report\" and, when pressed on whether he would release new details, said, \"I don't think we will.\" On October 1, Sanders was rushed to an urgent care facility following a grassroots fundraiser in Las Vegas after experiencing chest pains. Sanders then was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and remained there for days before returning home to recuperate.  He was back on the campaign trail about two weeks after he initially fell ill. Dr. Brian Monahan, the Capitol Hill physician, said in a Dec. 30 letter addressed to Sanders, \"You are in good health currently and you have been engaging vigorously in the rigors of your campaign, travel, and other scheduled activities without any limitation.\" Monahan also more directly addressed the senator's heart health. \"Several of the medications you initially required (blood-thinner, beta blocker) were stopped based on your progress,\" Monahan wrote. \"Your heart muscle strength has improved. You have never had symptoms of congestive heart failure. The heart chamber sizes, wall thickness, estimated pressures, and heart valves are normal. Several 24-hour recordings of your heart electrical activity indicated no significant heat rhythm abnormality.\" Watch:  Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night sought to fully divorce himself from supporters who have harassed others online and questioned whether anyone who believes in his agenda would attack a union leader. Top officials at the Culinary Union in Nevada accused Sanders backers of swarming them online after flyers distributed by the union, which said Sanders would \"end\" their health care, went viral. Sanders also questioned whether some of the social media comments cited by critics were, in fact, written by his supporters. \"The idea that anybody who works with me would make a vicious attack against a union leader just because we disagree on an issue is incomprehensible to me,\" Sanders said, \"and you know what, I\u2019m just not sure that that\u2019s true.\" He also pointed out that members of his own staff had been the targets of online harassment. \"Talk to the people in my campaign, often the African American women in this campaign, talk to my wife, about the kind of ugly attacks that have come in to us,\" he said. On the broader issue, Sanders was -- in his final point on the question -- unequivocal. \u201cI do not believe in online bullying,\" he said. \"End of discussion.\u201d Watch the moment: Bernie Sanders rejected the idea on Tuesday that Donald Trump tweets about him so frequently because the President wants to face him in November. After CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked Sanders why Trump wants to face him,\u201d Sanders sarcastically replied, \u201cOh, really?\u201d \u201cThat's not how I would interpret\u00a0it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Trump understands that\u00a0we have something that other\u00a0candidates don't and that we have an\u00a0unprecedented grassroots\u00a0movement.\u201d Sanders lauded his devout following as the \u201ckind of\u00a0grassroots movement that we need\u00a0to defeat Trump.\u201d \u201cAnd what Trump understand that\u00a0is the way he's going to lose is\u00a0when we have the largest voter\u00a0turnout in the history of this\u00a0country,\u201d he added. Trump and a number of top Republican elected officials and operatives often publicly comment on Sanders, sometimes suggesting that the Democratic establishment is seeking to deny him the nomination because they oppose his more progressive platform. The strategy by Republicans appears to be to pump up Sanders and his supporters as a way to help him gain the nomination because Republicans believe Sanders, who self-identifies as a \u201cDemocratic socialist,\u201d would be the easiest general election challenger. Watch the moment: Bernie Sanders called Michael Bloomberg's strategy of skipping the first four states \"obscene\" and said the former New York mayor was trying to \"buy the presidency.\" The Vermont senator suggested Bloomberg had insulted both voters and the democratic process, noting that all of the other primary candidates had spent months engaging the electorate. \"He said \u2018I don\u2019t have to do that, I'm worth $60 billion,'\" Sanders said, mimicking Bloomberg. \"'I\u2019ll buy the presidency.\u2019\u201d Sanders also ripped Bloomberg's embrace of \"stop and frisk\" policing during the billionaire businessman's three terms as mayor. \u201dHis policies humiliated and offended hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d Sanders said.  Bloomberg has apologized for supporting \"stop and frisk,\" but his past comments about the practice have added fuel to the controversy surrounding his record.  Sanders will get the chance to face Bloomberg on the debate stage for the first time on Wednesday. Hear Sen. Sanders' comments: Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t answer a question about whether he would accept hundreds of millions of dollars in help from Michael Bloomberg if the Vermont senator becomes the Democratic nominee.\u00a0 Sanders told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper he doesn\u2019t have a super PAC and hasn\u2019t asked for one, but then ignored a question about whether he\u2019d accept Bloomberg\u2019s money.\u00a0 Instead, Sanders touted raising seven million individual contributions, averaging $18.15 from a broad base of Americans.\u00a0 \u201cThere is a point at which money ceases to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have enough money to run a strong campaign. We will have enough money to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\u00a0 Bloomberg has been self-funding his own presidential campaign, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising alone. Watch the moment: The event with Sanders has begun. He will answer questions from CNN's Anderson Cooper. Tonight's town halls come just days before Nevada voters will head to caucus sites. In an effort to prevent the same chaos that occurred at the Iowa caucuses, the Nevada State Democratic Party announced new details on changes being made to\u00a0its presidential caucuses that are focused on calculating and reporting results. After dropping an app built by the same company whose \"coding errors\"\u00a0caused mass confusion\u00a0in Iowa, the Nevada party created a new tool and consulted with the Department of Homeland Security, the Democratic National Committee and other experts to update their reporting system and two-source reporting verification process. While the party isn't calling it an app, precinct chairs will use a \"caucus calculator\" on party-bought iPads to work out viability and delegate results during the caucuses by adding together caucus results and early vote data into the tool.\u00a0 On caucus day, voters will be asked to rank their top three to five choices for president on their ballot, which will be scanned at a processing hub and used at their assigned precinct location on caucus day. The results from early voting will be included in the caucus calculator and on paper to help precinct chairs include them properly. CNN's town halls come after the Nevada State Democratic Party\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that more than 18,500 state Democrats participated in first day of early voting this past weekend. This is a considerable turnout that Democrats celebrated even as some\u00a0voters voiced concerns over long wait times. What early voting has been like: Wait times of more than three hours and a lack of volunteers at\u00a0at least one precinct\u00a0had some voters worried about the state's caucuses on February 22.
