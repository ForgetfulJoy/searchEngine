Democratic debate If they weren't already, the gloves definitely came off at last night's debate. The heat was on front-runner Bernie Sanders, with the other six candidates all taking shots at him in an attempt to knock him off the path to the Democratic nomination. Their case: Nominating the Vermont senator would weaken the Democratic Party in the general election, both against Trump and in House and Senate races on the ticket.\u00a0It was a chaotic and messy debate, with the candidates shouting over each other incomprehensibly at times. And in the end, no one emerged completely unscathed. Read CNN's takeaways, and Chris Cillizza's list of winners and losers. Whether\u00a0the other candidates made their\u00a0case against Sanders successfully remains to be seen at the South Carolina primary this Saturday\u00a0and the Super Tuesday contests next week.\u00a0 2. Coronavirus Emergency measures and travel restrictions are in place worldwide, as outbreaks of the\u00a0novel coronavirus continue to grow inside China and abroad. China reported more than 400 new cases today, but only five of them were outside the outbreak's epicenter. South Korea, Italy and Iran continue\u00a0to grapple with the spread of the virus, while other countries in the Middle East see new infections, too. In the US, a top CDC official said it's not a question of if coronavirus will spread but when.\u00a0She warned that the virus could bring severe disruption to American life and that people should get ready now. US cases have risen to 57, while a US soldier stationed in South Korea also tested positive for the virus. President Trump, however, assured that the virus is \"going to go away,\" raising questions about how his administration would respond to an outbreak at home. 3. India At least 21\u00a0people have been killed\u00a0and 188 injured in two days of violent clashes in New Delhi between hundreds of supporters and opponents of a\u00a0new law that fast-tracks citizenship\u00a0for non-Muslim minorities from select countries. The unrest erupted Monday in parts of the Indian capital, coinciding with\u00a0President Trump's\u00a0state visit. Authorities deployed tear gas, as police said protesters hurled stones and set vehicles and a gasoline pump on fire. Indians have been protesting the controversial citizenship law for months. Opposition parties say it's unconstitutional and would further marginalize the country's Muslims. The government, ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), says it's intended to protect religious minorities fleeing persecution.\u00a0 4. Disney Bob Iger has stepped down as CEO of the Walt Disney Company. Iger, who may be the second most-important person in Disney history behind Walt himself, built the company into the giant it is today. He oversaw the acquisition Pixar, Marvel Studios,\u00a0and Lucasfilm, all of which produced films that shattered box office records across the globe. The timing of Iger's announcement came as a shock to both Disney employees and the media world, and the question now is whether he can be replaced. He\u00a0hands the reins to Bob Chapek, the head of Disney parks, experiences and products. Iger will remain with Disney to direct the company's creative endeavors through the end of 2021. 5. Syria At least 21 civilians were killed and more than 80 were injured yesterday in an attack in Idlib province in northwestern Syria, according to a medical relief group. Air strikes and ground attacks hit 10 schools and a hospital. Nine children and three teachers were among those killed, and three nurses and a doctor were among the injured. The Syrian government said yesterday that its forces seized several towns and villages in the southern Idlib countryside after army units carried out\u00a0operations against terrorists.\u00a0In the last two months, more than 832,000 people have fled the last opposition-held territory in Syria, after a relentless air campaign and a swift ground offensive by the Syrian regime and its Russian backers. Tens of thousands of people are still on the move.
