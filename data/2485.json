Shrinking community: The town's population decreased significantly after an earthquake in 1980 and has never fully recovered. Revitalization hopes: \"Two babies are born [in Teora] each year versus 20 elders who die,\" Stefano Farina, the mayor of Teora, tells CNN. \"We're down to barely 1,500 residents.\" Unoccupied homes: There are almost 100 empty buildings in Teora looking for new occupants. Deal stipulations: Buyers will need to take up residency for at least three years, and they must have at least one child already when they put in an application. Appealing offer: According to Farina, two new Italian families have already settled in the town, along with a Brazilian family with Italian roots. Historic elements: An old amphitheater still stands here, despite the damage inflicted by the earthquake back in 1980. Town highlights: The ruins of the Chiesa Madre di San Nicola di Mira, which was destroyed by earthquakes at least four times, still stands in Teora. Art gallery: The Museum of Contemporary Art -- Pinacoteca di Teora is one of the town's many highlights. Idyllic location: Set in the corner of Campania's wild Irpinia area, Teora lies close to the sea, with Paestum, situated just an hour's drive away along with the Cilento National Park and the Amalfi Coast."], "Language": false}
