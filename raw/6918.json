Brady Noon, best known for his role in \"Good Boys,\" will also star, playing her son, Evan.  In the 10-episode series, Graham will play a hockey mom who sets out to build her own team and \"challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports\" after her son is \"unceremoniously cut from the Ducks,\" according to a description from Disney.  Graham, also known for her role on \"Parenthood\" and currently starring on \"Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist,\" will be a co-executive producer on the show.  The show will be filmed in Vancouver and premiere later this year on Disney+.  \"The Mighty Ducks\" will be produced by ABC Signature Studios, which is part of Disney Television Studios.
