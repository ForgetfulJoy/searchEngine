If you see a masterpiece you recognize, submit a tip at tips.fbi.gov,\" the bureau tweeted.  \"Roses are red; violets are blue. Help the #FBI find a painting; here is a clue: Johan Laurents Jensen's \"Still Life of Roses in a Basket on a Table\" is an oil painting that measures 15 1/2 inches by 18 inches\"  The bureau had a thread full of stolen artworks, which obviously broke the hearts of the investigating agents.  And, of course the bureau was looking for a jewelry bedazzled card case on Valentine's Day.  \"Are you exchanging cards on #ValentinesDay but have nowhere to put them? Neither do we. Help the #FBI find a stolen Faberge card case made by Fedor Ruckert between 1895-1905. It is decorated with gold, silver, enamel, and ruby.\" Each Friday the FBI's Art Crime Team writes pun-filled tweets about stolen art.
