Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque announced that he will extend the nationwide isolation order until April 26.\u00a0 In a tweet, Duque said the measures taken to slow the spread of coronavirus \"have been positive.\u201d \"Our challenge is to continue saving lives.\"\u00a0Duque\u00a0added.\u00a0 The order for \u201cmandatory preventive\u00a0isolation\u201d took effect on March 25 and was initially scheduled until April 13. ##Health## ##Daily Life## All 10 million residents in Los Angeles County are now eligible to apply for a coronavirus test. Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference today that there are \u201cno longer any limits\u201d on who can apply for the\u00a0testing.\u00a0Patients don\u2019t have to be over age 65, have underlying medical conditions, or have a weakened immune system, as was previously required.\u00a0 Garcetti said that doesn\u2019t mean officials immediately have a test for everyone in the county -- the most populous in the US -- but it means that the capacity of tests is now greater than the number of cases they\u2019ve been receiving under the previous guidelines. LA County residents can register for testing at\u00a0https://corona-virus.la ##Health## ##Daily Life## If North Carolina stops social distancing at the end of April -- as President Donald Trump and administration officials have pushed for -- there could be 750,000 state residents infected by June, said state health officials. \u201cThe team found that the social distancing policies we currently have in place in North Carolina will help lower the likelihood that we\u2019ll overload our health care system, that\u2019s good news,\u201d said Mandy Cohen,\u00a0Secretary of the North Carolina\u00a0Department\u00a0of\u00a0Health and Human Services, in a news conference today.\u00a0 The North Carolina-specific modeling forecast showed that if the state stopped social distancing by the end of this month, there is more than a 50% probability that the state will outstrip ICU bed capability and acute care capacity -- even as early as May. On the other hand, if social distancing stayed in effect, it could cut the number of infections by half a million cases -- down to 250,000. North Carolina now has 2,870 cases and 33 deaths, said Cohen.  ##Health## Chile\u00a0has announced the mandatory use of face masks for all travelers riding public and private transportation to combat the spread of coronavirus. During a televised press conference Monday, Chile's Undersecretary of Public Health Paula Daza said the measure will go in effect Wednesday, April 8 at 5 am local time.\u00a0 Some of the transportation methods that are included in the measure include trains, buses, metros and taxis.\u00a0 The announcement comes after Health Minister Jaime Ma\u00f1alich called on the population to start making their own masks with homemade materials, such as T-shirts and scarves. California's Judicial Council approved a series of temporary emergency rules Monday, including staying eviction and foreclosure proceedings during the Covid-19 pandemic, a vote that reinforces\u00a0Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's executive order to delay such actions against renters and homeowners in the state.\u00a0 During a teleconference Monday afternoon, the council also moved to set\u00a0bail statewide at $0 for misdemeanors and lower-level felonies to \"safely reduce jail populations.\" Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye opened the session saying,\u00a0\"(We are) trying our best to preserve rights and ultimately preserve lives.\"  \"We are at this point truly with no guidance in either history, law or precedent. And to say that there is no playbook is a gross understatement of\u00a0the\u00a0situation.\" District attorney Jackie Lacey, who presides over Los Angeles County where a zero-bail measure was implemented last week to reduce the number of inmates, applauded the decision. \"I appreciate the collaboration among criminal justice leaders in Los Angeles County that has resulted in the rapid deployment of new and innovative approaches as we work to try to stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community,\" Lacey said in a statement.\u00a0 In total the council approved 11 temporary emergency rules.\u00a0Among the actions the council approved, to go into effect immediately are: Suspend the entry of defaults in eviction cases;\nSuspend judicial foreclosures;\nAllow courts to require judicial proceedings and court operations be conducted remotely, with the defendant\u2019s consent in criminal proceedings;\nAdopt a statewide emergency bail schedule that sets bail at $0 for most misdemeanor and lower-level felony offenses;\nAllow defendants to appear via counsel or remote technologies for pretrial criminal hearings;\nPrioritize hearings and orders in juvenile justice proceedings and set a structure for remote hearings and continuances;\nExtend the timeframes for specified temporary restraining orders;\nExtend the statutes of limitations governing civil actions; and\nAllow electronic depositions in civil cases. During Monday's White House coronavirus task force briefing, Trump claimed that the Paycheck Protection Program -- a small businesses lending program -- has \u201creally been\u00a0performing\u00a0well.\u201d Trump said there were a few \u201cminor glitches that have already been taken care of.\u201d \u00a0Facts First:\u00a0CNN has reported significant issues to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), with system wide failures as lenders process these loans. Days after the launch of the Small Business Administration's rollout of the PPP,\u00a0there are still delays\u00a0in the system lenders use to upload loan application information and the money is still largely not going out to the businesses that need it yet. According to\u00a0an\u00a0industry source\u00a0who spoke to CNN, major system-wide failures continue to crop up in the PPP system, including shutdowns\u00a0preventing the submission of applications from\u00a0lenders on their system known as E-Tran. These issues have slowed down the ability for banks to participate in the loan program,\u00a0this source tells CNN.\u00a0 Additionally,\u00a0several bank executives\u00a0tell CNN they want\u00a0the Treasury Department or the Small Business Administration to offer more guidance on how they are supposed to disburse funds.\u00a0CNN reporting indicates there are\u00a0also concerns among lenders who say they won\u2019t cut checks until there is clear guidance on how they should distribute the money.

Pregnant women don\u2019t seem to be any more susceptible to severe symptoms of Covid-19, compared to the general population and they don\u2019t seem to pass the infection onto their babies, according to a new study, The small study was published Monday in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and looked at data from 43 pregnant women in New York who tested positive for Covid-19 over two weeks between March 13 and 27. Thirty-seven of the women in the study experienced a mild form of Covid-19, four developed a severe form of the disease and two experienced what researchers called \u201ccritical disease.\u201d The percentages are similar to the breakdown of severity in disease in the general population. About 80% experience\u00a0mild disease, 15% develop severe cases and 5% result in critical cases. Scientists were interested in the impact of the disease on pregnant women because in prior SARS and H1N1 pandemics, pregnant women were more susceptible to serious forms of the illness and had a greater chance of dying from the infection than the general population. None of the babies in this study seemed to be infected, based on tests performed on them on the first day of their lives. Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, says she did not visit her grandchild despite the 10-month-old having \u201ca fever of 105 this weekend.\u201d  Birx shared her experience during a Monday task force briefing with reporters, while urging people in particularly high-risk areas to stay home as much as possible. \u201cI\u2019m the doctor. And I couldn\u2019t get there,\u201d she said during the press briefing. \u201cI mean, so I\u2019m trying to explain to my daughter how to listen to her lungs. How to listen to her lungs, how to listen to the baby\u2019s lungs\u2026\u201d President Donald Trump, standing feet away from Birx, asked, \u201cBut you did not get there, you did not get there?\u201d  \u201cI did not go there. Because of you two,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the President and Vice President Mike Pence, who stood nearby. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t take that kind of risk with the leaders of the country.\u201d Birx said that her granddaughter is \u201ccoming out of it.\u201d  She stopped short of telling people not to go to the grocery store for the next week in high-risk areas, but did recommend consolidating shopping trips and sending one member per family. Watch the moment: President Donald Trump on Monday questioned whether politics tinged the findings of a newly released Health and Human Services inspector general report that found hospitals have been most concerned about a shortage of coronavirus testing supplies and long wait times for test results. After listening to a reporter citing the report during Monday\u2019s White House press briefing, Trump responded, \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong. It\u2019s just wrong. Did I hear the word \u2018inspector general'? Really?\u201d The President also questioned the integrity of the leadership in HHS\u2019 Office of the Inspector General saying, \u201cWell where did he come from, the inspector general? What\u2019s his name?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had more testing and had more results than any country anywhere in the world. They\u2019re doing an incredible job,\u201d the President continued. \u201cSo give me the name of the inspector general. Could politics be entered into that?\u201d he concluded. The report was based on interviews with more than 300 hospitals around the country. Admiral Brett Giroir, who serves as the assistant secretary for health, expressed frustration with the recent OIG report\u2019s findings, saying during Monday\u2019s briefing that the OIG\u2019s office did not adequately communicate with him. Giroir pointed out that the report was done around March 23 and March 24, which he said was \u201cduring a ramp-up period.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s hard to interpret the report because it mixes up all kinds of things, but clearly there were complaints by some hospitals of a backlog, had probably sent out tests, and that is true. There were several days of backlog as some of the major labs that have been taken care,\u201d Giroir said. Watch CNN reporters fact check Trump's claims:  Asked about the possibility of restrictions on travel between coronavirus hotspots, President Donald Trump said: \u201cThere\u2019s also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no evidence that plane passengers in the US are being tested for the coronavirus at all, let alone both when they get on and get off the plane.\u00a0While it is theoretically possible this is happening under the radar at a particular airport, it is certainly not happening widely. Trump might have meant to refer to screening -- which involves questioning and sometimes temperature checks -- rather than actual testing, but major US airlines are not doing screening, either. Some plane passengers are being subjected to government screening upon landing, but most passengers are not -- and this screening, unlike testing, cannot conclusively determine whether someone has the virus.

Watch analysis here:\u00a0  Nissan plans to furlough most of its hourly manufacturing employees as its US plants remain closed to help slow the spread of Covid-19. Nissan spokeswoman Lloryn Love-Carter confirmed the company will layoff about 10,000 employees Tuesday at plants in Canton, Mississippi; Smyrna, Tennessee and Decherd, Tennessee. Nissan asked furloughed employees to apply for enhanced unemployment through at least April 27, when the company will restart production. Nissan closed its US plants on March 20. President Donald Trump confirmed his phone call with former Vice President Joe Biden Monday, calling it a \u201cwonderful, warm conversation\" about the coronavirus pandemic.  Trump said the phone called lasted \u201cprobably 15 minutes\u201d and reiterated that it was a \u201creally good\u201d call. \u201cHe gave me his point of view and I fully understood that,\u201d Trump said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cI appreciate his calling,\u201d the President said. CNN reported earlier Monday that the Democratic presidential candidate and Trump had spoken by phone. Watch here: President Donald Trump said that he\u2019s \"going to get involved\" in the case of a Navy captain removed from command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt. At a Monday briefing, Trump was asked about comments made by Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly, who attacked Capt. Brett Crozier as either \"too naive or too stupid\" to be in command. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard it exactly, I heard they heard,\u201d Trump said, referring to the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt. \u201cI heard they had a statement that was made, if that were the statement, it\u2019s a strong statement.\u201d Crozier was relieved of command after a letter he sent to Navy leadership was leaked to the media. The letter flagged his concerns about the Roosevelt's crew of more than 4,000 -- saying in part that \"sailors do not need to die\"-- and discussed the challenges of trying to contain an outbreak of coronavirus aboard the ship. He urgently requested that sailors be allowed to quarantine on land.  The Navy cited loss of confidence in his command. \u201cThe letters shouldn\u2019t have been sent, and certainly they shouldn\u2019t have been leaked,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a military operation. I must tell you I\u2019ve heard very good things about the gentlemen. Both gentlemen, by the way, I will say this. About both gentlemen. And I may look into it from the standpoint of something should be resolved because I\u2019m hearing good things about both of people.\u201d The state of California and the County of Los Angeles has partnered with Dignity Health and Kaiser Permanente to open up a \u201cLos Angeles Surge Hospital\u201d for coronavirus patients in the city. The temporary facility, which will be located on the campus of the former St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, will expand access to additional beds and expand ICU capacity for coronavirus patients in the coming weeks, according to a press release from Los Angeles County. The hospital is expected to open on April 13 in phases, \u201cramping up to accept more patients as physicians and staff are hired and supplies and equipment are secured.\u201d When fully operational, up to 266 beds will be available. A small experiment involving patients with coronavirus who wore cotton and surgical masks showed that both seemed ineffective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus when the patients coughed. Scientists found coronavirus particles in the environment and on the exterior of the mask itself.\u00a0 The experiment was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Scientists tested face masks on four patients infected with the coronavirus at two hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. They compared the use of surgical masks with reusable 100% cotton masks against patients who were not wearing masks. The researchers placed a petri dish about 7 inches from the patients\u2019 mouths and told the patient to cough five times each onto a petri dish. Researchers saw greater contamination on the outer surface of the mask, compared to the inner surface. It was unclear if the force of the person\u2019s cough leaked out of the edge of the mask to contaminate the outer surface, or if the particles of the coronavirus were so small that a high-velocity cough penetrated the mask.\u00a0 The experiment did not look at the effectiveness of N95 masks, nor did it show if the masks protected against the actual transmission of infection from patients with Covid-19 while wearing different masks. Nor does it show if masks shorten the distance these droplets travel while someone is coughing.  More research will be needed to determine if the masks help prevent the spread of the disease with people who are asymptomatic or people who have Covid-19 and aren\u2019t coughing. Former Wisconsin inmate Jeremy Egger gave CNN a glimpse inside what a Covid-19 prison lockdown looked like in his medium security facility over the past three weeks. With limited contact to the outside, he heard snippets about the coronavirus pandemic on a prison radio. \u201cThe\u00a0radio station we had, it was from Milwaukee. We only had bits and pieces about a virus out there.\u201d\u00a0 Egger said that -- without being told anything directly by the guards -- he could tell something was changing within the prison. Egger said guards' posturing was different.  \u201cWhether inmates were coming down with it or guards, I didn\u2019t know, but something wasn\u2019t right and it was in the institution,\" he said. Former Wisconsin state prison employee Jeff Wydeven said a change in demeanor with the guards doesn\u2019t surprise him at all. \u201cOf course they\u2019re going to be scared,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s their health too.\u201d Egger, 33, was taking morning courses in Wisconsin\u2019s Thinking For Change program and studying in the afternoons.\u00a0He arrived\u00a0at the Metropolitan Secure Detention Facility (MSDF)\u00a0on March 12\u00a0expecting to serve three months for a parole violation. Three days later everything changed. While Egger was taking one of his courses, \u201cthey suddenly locked the entire place down,\" he said.  \"Everybody had to go back in their cells and that\u2019s when we\u2019re like, OK, there\u2019s got to be a case here somewhere,\" Egger said. 'From the normal to being locked' Prison life went \u201cfrom the normal to being locked,\u201d he said.\u00a0Egger said the initial lockdown was 23 1/2 hours a day with only 30 minutes out of a cell he shared with three other inmates.\u00a0They shared a dry cell that Egger described as a cell without a toilet, running water or television. Those 30 minutes a day gave them time to use the phone, microwave food and use shower facilities.\u00a0 During a call with his mother on March 25, Egger\u00a0grew concerned because she was exhibiting symptoms of the virus, but couldn\u2019t get a test.\u00a0His mother, Cheryl Fountaine-Kempf, said\u00a0she \u201ccould easily detect the pain and fear in his voice.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 The next day, an even more stringent lock down was instituted, according to Egger.\u00a0 \u201cIt just all changed again from one day to the next,\u201d Egger said, adding that\u00a0inmates were only allowed out\u00a0for 45 minutes about every\u00a0three\u00a0days.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sitting there wanting to call my mom, thinking she\u2019s deathly sick and I can\u2019t call her for another two days.\u201d Guards told Egger they were trying to do their part in helping to slow the\u00a0spread, he said. MSDF Milwaukee has the largest population of parole revocations re-entering the system for short periods of time \u201cso people are going in and out constantly which creates much more of a risk than\u00a0other facilities,\u201d according to Wydeven. Four staff members at MSDF have tested positive, according to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, which noted on its website this is the highest number of staff cases at any Wisconsin prison. \u201cEach site has pandemic plans to address COVID-19,\u201d according to the website which states the plan includes \u201cprotocols and isolation procedures if someone is exposed and/or becomes infected. In the event of a confirmed positive case in one of our secure facilities, contact investigations are being conducted to determine which individuals may have been exposed to the virus, and subsequent isolation or quarantine may occur to manage these situations.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Department of Corrections for additional details. More changes On March 30, almost three months before his expected release, Egger was told to contact his family and probation officers because there was a possibility he was going to get out.\u00a0He said after that even more changes began happening.\u00a0 \u201cThe last two weeks there was no laundry was\u00a0being done internally and it was instead, outsourced,\u201d he said.  Wydeven said while inmates normally do the laundry, with a lockdown they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\u00a0 \u201cWe had to wear the same 'yellows,' a jumpsuit, for like two weeks,\u201d Egger said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to wash our hands, but we could only shower about once every other day If we were lucky ... and wearing dirty clothes With no running water in their cell hand washing was at a minimum,\" he said. Egger, a registered sex offender, was released on April 3.\u00a0He was originally released from prison in 2016 and obtained his welder\u2019s certificate and a commercial drivers\u2019 license. He is living with his mother for the next two weeks to make sure he hasn\u2019t contracted the virus, and then\u00a0will move to rural Wisconsin with his father, he told CNN. Watch video from inside the prison: Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court blocked Democratic Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 order to postpone Tuesday\u2019s election, despite his arguments that in-person voting could endanger poll workers and voters because of the coronavirus pandemic. The court sided with Republicans who control the state legislature and opposed Evers\u2019 executive order Monday that sought to delay the election until June 9. The decision was 4-2, with the court\u2019s conservative majority backing the GOP\u2019s position.\u00a0 It was the latest twist in a legal battle that has thrown the primary into chaos as state and local elections officials have consolidated polling places and scrambled to find workers and supplies for those that will open.\u00a0 Los Angeles County health officials urged residents to skip grocery shopping this week as the number of coronaviruses cases continue to rise.\u00a0 \u201cIf you have enough supplies in your home, this would be the week to skip shopping altogether,\u201d said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the LA County Department of Public Health Director, on Monday. This would be the week to use delivery services for medications and groceries, she advised. \u201cWe will see many more cases over the next few weeks. It remains important that we continue to do what we know will work,\u201d she added. President Donald Trump on Monday said he won't take steps to physically separate from Vice President Mike Pence to protect the continuity of government in light of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's worsening condition. \"No I don't think so,\" Trump said when asked about potential new steps he might take after the top US ally fell seriously ill from coronavirus. Trump said he would likely ramp up testing of people around him given the relative ease and speed of new testing kits. \"I think we\u2019ll probably, just because of questions like that, I think we\u2019ll probably have maybe quite a few tests,\" he said.\u00a0 Standing alongside Trump, Pence said he was tested earlier Monday and that it came back negative. Neither Trump nor Pence nor other members of the White House coronavirus task force wore masks to Monday's briefing, despite updated guidance from the federal government suggesting face coverings in settings where social distancing is difficult. Watch here: President Donald Trump said Monday he would be granting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s request to convert a hospital ship docked off of Manhattan to treat coronavirus patients. Cuomo, a Democrat, told members of the press earlier Monday that he was \u201cgoing to call the President this afternoon and ask him to shift the (USNS) Comfort from non-Covid to Covid.\u201d\u00a0 Trump, speaking at a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, said he \u201cwas informed that Gov. Cuomo has already told you and announced he called me up a little while ago and asked whether or not it would be possible to use the ship with respect to fighting the virus.\u201d \u201cWe hadn\u2019t had that in mind at all, but we\u2019re going to let him do it,\u201d Trump remarked. The President also confirmed that the ship has been approved to treat New Jersey patients. Before British Prime Minister Boris Johnson went into intensive care on Monday evening with worsening coronavirus-related symptoms, he asked his Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State Dominic Raab to deputize for him \u201cwhere necessary.\u201d While now is a time of great uncertainty for the British public, Johnson\u2019s handing over of some duties to Raab should be relatively seamless and is unlikely to affect any immediate government business. Less clear is what will happen if Johnson is incapacitated for more than a few days. There\u2019s no clear \u201cPlan B\u201d in Britain\u2019s constitution or in the Cabinet Manual \u2013 which lays out the rules for running the government \u2013 for who should take over if Johnson isn\u2019t able to lead the country, experts told Reuters.\u00a0 One thing that should help in terms of continuity: Unlike in the United States, where a President might hail from a different party than leaders in Congress, the UK government is entirely comprised of members of Parliament from Johnson\u2019s party, which won the most seats in December\u2019s election \u2013 meaning it operates as one entity. An ardent Brexiteer\u00a0 Raab, a 46-year-old former lawyer, was elected to Parliament in 2010,\u00a0and spent his entire political career on the same wing of the party that secretly yearned for Johnson to have a serious go at taking the reins.\u00a0\u00a0 Like Johnson, Raab is a longstanding advocate of Brexit who was willing to be a thorn in his own party\u2019s side when it had more pro-European leadership. Despite his euroskeptic leanings, his qualities were noticed by that pro-European leadership, and when then-Prime Minister David Cameron won reelection in 2015, Raab was offered a job in government. At the time, Raab was seen as a rising star within the party, and his promotion was seen as a way for Cameron to bolster his own euroskeptic credentials. Raab previously served in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet as the Brexit secretary, only to resign in protest at the deal she eventually struck with the EU. And despite running against Johnson in last summer\u2019s Conservative leadership contest, he has been extraordinarily loyal to the Prime Minister ever since.\u00a0 While Raab is perhaps less socially liberal than Johnson, it is highly unlikely he would depart radically from the Prime Minister\u2019s agenda in the short-term -- not just because there simply isn\u2019t enough time to change government policy during a time of national crisis, but also because the UK cabinet works on the principle of collective responsibility.\u00a0 President Donald Trump announced the United States has reached an agreement with 3M that will see the company supply 55 million additional N95 respirator masks to the US\u00a0each month.  \"Because of my actions under the (Defense Production Act) I can also announce today that we have reached an agreement \u2014 very amicable agreement with 3M \u2014 with the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high quality face masks each month,\" Trump said during a Monday press conference.\u00a0 The agreement comes just days after\u00a0Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to force the company's hand. Under the deal,\u00a03M will ship an additional 55 million masks per month to the US from its overseas factories for the next three months, a senior administration official said, which will help alleviate shortages in personal protective equipment for medical workers. The overwhelming majority of the masks will come from 3M's Chinese factories, the official said. A senior administration official said the government's decision to use the Defense Production Act was key to shifting the trajectory of negotiations between the two sides and forcing 3M's hand. Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that the state\u2019s ban on in-person school classes will continue for the remainder of the school year.\u00a0 Despite signs that the increase in coronavirus cases may be leveling off in many places, \u201cwe cannot risk losing the gains we have made after the peak of this pandemic presumably will have passed,\u201d Inslee said. Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal said reopening schools too soon would be even more disruptive than at-home instruction, since a single Covid-19 case in a school would force that building to be closed again for days, at least, until contacts could be traced and the building deep cleaned.\u00a0 Reykdal acknowledged they are not certain at this point that school buildings in Washington will be able to open as normal in time for the beginning of the new academic year this fall. US President Donald Trump said he and several pharmaceutical companies have contacted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s doctors in London to see if they can help after he was admitted to an intensive care unit Monday for coronavirus. \u201cI also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend of our nation Prime Minster Boris Johnson. We\u2019re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care ... a little while ago,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a really good friend. He\u2019s been really something very special. Strong. Resolute.\u201d Trump said he held a teleconference with pharmaceutical companies about therapies for coronavirus patients earlier Monday. \u201cWe have made tremendous progress on therapeutics,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve asked two of the leading companies\u2026 I\u2019ve asked them to contact London immediately.\u201d He said his administration has contacted Johnson's doctors. \u201cWe\u2019ve contacted all of Boris\u2019 doctors, and we\u2019ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go,\u201d the President said. \u201cWhen you are brought into intensive care that gets very, very serious.\u201d He added: \"We are working with London with respect to Boris Johnson.\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced help for veterans, as well as for Asian Americans who are facing discrimination amid the coronavirus outbreak, in a press conference Monday. Starting Monday, Minnesota veterans who are impacted by the novel coronavirus can apply for financial assistance grants from the Minnesota Department of Veteran Affairs.  Walz also announced the lieutenant governor was leading the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and launching a discrimination helpline for calls of xenophobia and racism, specifically aimed at Asian American community. Minnesota has 986 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 31 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. A New York doctor said Monday that hospitals in the state are overwhelmed as more patients arrive with coronavirus. Dr. Craig Spencer, the director of Global\u00a0Health in Emergency Medicine at New\u00a0York-Presbyterian/Columbia\u00a0University Medical Center, said emergency rooms are being converted into intensive care units and morgues are filling up. \"We have trucks outside to hold\u00a0bodies, those are getting\u00a0filled,\" Spencer told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\" He said while data shows the number of new infections is decreasing, there is a lag time between when people get sick and when they come to emergency rooms. \"In the best case scenario, it\u00a0may be another week or two\u00a0before we have a decrease in the\u00a0really, really sick patients,\" he said. Spencer said social distancing is still very important and is the best way to continue to battle the virus and continue to decrease numbers. \"Instead of peddling a bunch of\u00a0treatments that we don't know\u00a0whether they work or some magic\u00a0bullet, we know what does work -- if you stay home, you will not\u00a0get infected with this virus.\u00a0If you do not get infected with\u00a0this virus, you will not show up\u00a0sick in the emergency room,\" he said. Hear his message:  One of the last states in the nation to not have a stay-at-home order will now have one starting tomorrow. South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster announced a mandatory stay-at-home order in a press conference Monday. The order goes into effect Tuesday April 7 at 5 pm ET.  South Carolina residents should stay home unless they are working, visiting family, recreating outdoors, or obtaining necessary goods or services, he said. The first time Dominique Shuminova saw her newborn daughter, Clara, after giving birth, it was only her eyes that could smile. The rest of her face was covered by a black mask, thanks to Covid-19. Baby Clara will always have that picture to show her own children and grandchildren a world turned upside down when she came into it. Shuminova will always have the combined joy and pain \u2014 both emotional and physical \u2014 of delivering her daughter in the time of the novel coronavirus. She delivered in New York, a Covid-19 hot spot where partners of women delivering babies are not allowed to come to the hospital, per state order. So, her husband, Eldar, had to stay home with their son Henry. Those of us who have given birth know it is hard in any circumstance. It turned out that she did it with more pain than she had planned for. She says she could not get an epidural because, when it was time, she was told that all of the hospital\u2019s anesthesiologists were busy intubating patients with Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And why the mask? Shuminova says that when she was admitted to the hospital at 5 a.m. ET Sunday morning, the hospital had to test her for coronavirus. Because the test took about 18 hours to come back, they treated her as if she were positive \u2014 so she was told to wear one. That meant that she went through the whole delivery alone, with no epidural, trying to breathe properly, as all women in labor do, all while wearing a mask. Still, Shuminova has it all in perspective. \u201cGiven the circumstances I am just grateful to have a bed and medical care,\u201d she said in a text message. She is healthy. Her newborn daughter is healthy. Especially in these times, that is nothing to be taken for granted.\u00a0\u00a0 Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he wants Washington to stop sending mixed messages when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. \"When you have people talking,\u00a0the President talking about he\u00a0might relax services, and let\u00a0services be happening for\u00a0Easter --  that's a mixed message,\" Walsh said.\u00a0\"We have to be consistent with\u00a0our messaging now and let people\u00a0know the impacts of the\u00a0coronavirus and how serious this\u00a0is in every city and state in\u00a0the country.\" He also said federal officials should stop criticizing governors for the way they are operating. \"We're in this together, and I think it's about us supporting\u00a0each other and moving and\u00a0getting the American people out\u00a0of the situation we're in,\" Walsh said. Walsh called for the federal government to deliver equipment to states that need it, including ventilators and personal protection equipment. Boston, he said, is expecting a surge of cases in the next two weeks. \"I would suggest to the\u00a0federal government that they get\u00a0on the ball here and get the\u00a0equipment down here,\" he said. \"No state or city should be\u00a0begging for equipment.\" Watch here:  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing to test more people in the United States for antibodies from the novel coronavirus to see whether they have already had the virus, according to a statement from CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund on Monday. A set of serological assays, or blood-based tests, will be able to detect antibodies that are specific to the virus. The tests, which were designed and produced by the vaccine research center at the National Institutes of Health, have already been used to monitor immune response in several coronavirus contact investigations.\u00a0 \u201cWe are also preparing to deploy them to larger surveys within the coming weeks to further identify individuals who, due to mild infection, may have not known they were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to monitor immunity in recovered individuals,\u201d Nordlund said.\u00a0 The US Food and Drug Administration last week issued its first emergency use authorization for a coronavirus test that looks for antibodies in the blood. Hospital admissions in Louisiana for the novel coronavirus are trending downward, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Monday. Edwards, a Democrat, said more than 70% of the deaths are African American patients, describing it as a \u201cbig disparity\u201d because African Americans make up about 32% of the state\u2019s population.  \u201cWe're going to try to figure out what that is attributable to and what we can do about that is as quickly as possible,\u201d Edwards said. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the government is allocating a record $400 billion euros to help families and businesses tackle the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \"This is the most powerful intervention of the story of our country,\" Conte said during a televised statement. \"200 billion to finance the internal market and another 200 billion to strengthen the export market.\" Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Conte said the government approved\u00a0the suspension of various tax payments and contributions for the months of April and May.  \"We are giving to the country a very efficient instrument to protect all businesses that have even the slightest strategic role in our country,\" he said. \"This is not only a health emergency but also economic and social at the same time. The April law decree will contain social protection tools, to support families and workers.\" Italy has 132,547 cases of coronavirus and has had 16,523 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. There are at least\u00a0356,942\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the United States and at least\u00a010,524\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases.

The National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell has announced that all league and club facilities will remain closed indefinitely and that the upcoming three-day NFL Draft, set to start on April 23, will be conducted in a \"fully virtual format\" with coaches and team personnel making picks from their individual homes. In a league-wide memo, first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter and\u00a0NFL Network\u2019s\u00a0Tom Pelissero, Goodell said that all teams will be required to\u00a0\u201cconduct their Draft operations remotely, with club personnel separately located in their homes.\u201d Goodell acknowledged the challenges the league is currently facing by saying in part,\u00a0\u201cwe are operating in an environment unlike anything we have experienced before.\u201d Missouri Governor Mike Parson signs executive order waiving state law requirements that notaries be physically present to authenticate documents.\u00a0 \u201cTo help protect the health & safety of Missourians who wish to execute changes in their important documents.\u00a0\u00a0Today, I signed an Executive Order waiving that requirement,\u201d tweeted Parson.\u00a0\u00a0 Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker wasted no time at today's press confernence in going after the federal government\u2019s response to Covid-19, specifically as it pertains to personal protective equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).\u00a0 The governor, who entered the briefing room wearing a face mask per US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, immediately called out the White House for changing the stated purpose on the SNS website from an entity that \u201csupport states\u201d to one that will \u201csupplement states\u201d in the short-term during a public healthcare emergency.\u00a0\u00a0 Pritzker said what his state was sent from the SNS is a \u201cmere fraction of what we asked for.\u201d\u00a0He went on to explain the tedious, sometimes difficult process of trying to obtain PPE from all over the world and \u201cby whatever means necessary\u201d saying he\u2019s often competing against other states and the federal government for the same supplies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To anyone who wants a response to some of the blame shifting coming out of the White House, Pritzker said, \u201clook at the numbers.\u201d\u00a0His state\u2019s own procurement efforts are what is keeping their first responders outfitted with what they need, he said.\u00a0\u00a0 With the state expecting its warmest day of the year so far on Tuesday, the governor and other health officials are urging residents to \u201cstay at home\u201d and not \u201ccongregate in the parks.\u201d\u00a0 Illinois reported 1,006 new cases of Covid-19 and 33 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, according to an announcement by the Department of Health at the governor\u2019s press briefing Monday.\u00a0The state has a total of 12,262 cases and 307 deaths.\u00a0 Alaska Airlines is cutting flights for the third time since the coronavirus pandemic began.\u00a0 In a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Seattle-based carrier said the latest cutbacks will mean an 80% drop compared to its typical number of flights for April and May. The new filing says \u201csizable cuts will be necessary for the coming months\u201d beyond May, although Alaska Airlines says it will wait before making specific decisions that far into 2020.\u00a0 The company also confirmed it has asked for payroll support grants under the CARES Act, one of the stimulus measures passed by Congress and signed by President Trump last month.\u00a0 ##Travel## ##Business## Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that 72% of all Chicago deaths related to Covid-19 have been black Chicagoans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While presenting statistics on how Covid-19 is affecting black residents more severely than white residents, Lightfoot announced a new Covid-19 patient data order to help combat the virus' effects on Chicago, including in the hardest hit African-American neighborhoods.\u00a0 Chicago\u00a0Department of Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady joined Lightfoot at\u00a0Monday's press conference and said that\u00a052% of the city's Covid-19 diagnoses have been in black Chicagoans. \"72% of our Covid deaths here in Chicago have been in black Chicagoans\" even though they make up 30%, Arwady said. \"Those numbers take your breath away,\" Mayor Lightfoot said.\u00a0\u00a0 Lightfoot criticized health care providers for not providing needed information on Covid-19 effects demographically.\u00a0 She's announcing the launch of a Covid-19 patient data order\u00a0that requires healthcare providers to report the race and ethnicity of those they treat. This is \"not negotiable,\" Lightfoot said, while announcing the new strategy in an effort to understand the full Coronavirus impact on the city. Before he was moved to the ICU, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked Foreign Secretary Dominic\u00a0Raab \u2014 who is the most senior Cabinet minister after Johnson \u2014 to deputize for him where necessary, according to a statement from 10 Downing Street. CNN correspondent Bianca Nobilo said Raab stood in for Johnson at the daily briefing on coronavirus and chaired the coronavirus \"war cabinet\" meeting today.

This is a part of Newsom\u2019s first phase to secure 50,000 beds beyond the current capacity. More than 80,000 people have filled out an application for the California Health Corps. These workers will help staff the sites. While the state has the physical sites and the human personnel, more PPE is needed. We need more ventilators and N95 masks, Newsom said. Newsom also reminded residents to continue to practice social distancing. \u201cPhysical distancing is working,\u201d he said.

Watch more: Wisconsin Gov.\u00a0Tony Evers\u00a0just ordered a suspension of his state's primary election just one day before it was scheduled to take place. Evers issued an\u00a0executive order\u00a0delaying tomorrow's primary until June 9, unless he and the legislature approve of a different date. He said in the order that \"no Wisconsinite should ever have to choose between exercising their constitutional right to vote and being safe, secure, and healthy.\" Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said he was proud of the governor and agrees that going forward with the election would put many people at risk. \"I can't ask\u00a0people to go in-person vote if I\u00a0think they're putting their\u00a0lives on the line.\u00a0I can't do that,\" Barrett told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The delay will be challenged: Some Republican state legislative leaders say they will ask the state Supreme Court to block the order. In a joint statement, state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, both Republicans, said they were challenging Evers' executive order in the Wisconsin Supreme Court and that local clerks should \"stand ready to proceed with the election.\" If courts allow Evers to delay the primary, his move could avert the need for the Wisconsin National Guard to man polling places Tuesday as poll workers quit due to the coronavirus pandemic. Wisconsin had been the only one of 11 states with April primaries that was moving forward with in-person voting, after the other 10 either delayed their primaries or shifted to by-mail only voting. ##Daily Life## National\u00a0grocery\u00a0store chain\u00a0Kroger\u00a0says it will only allow 50% of each store's capacity in to shop at one time, according to a statement released by the company today.

Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller whose mother died from coronavirus, said he is angry at the federal government's response to the pandemic. \"Donald Trump has\u00a0blood on his hands and my mom's\u00a0blood on his hands and he sent\u00a0us that hospital that's right here in the\u00a0Manhattan harbor and no one will get on that hospital,\" Stringer said.  About the ship: The USNS Comfort hospital ship docked in New York City last week. The original plan was for the the ship to treat non-coronavirus patients to ease the strain on area hospitals seeing an influx of infected patients. But today, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he believes the right move is for the ship to utilize its 1000-bed capacity to battle the coronavirus. Trump has said the ship could be used for coronavirus patients if needed. Stringer said his mother was a strong woman and the only way he was able to get closure was through an outpouring of texts and support from strangers. \"The government is supposed to\u00a0protect our people and we're\u00a0supposed to be able to protect\u00a0our parents and grandparents the\u00a0way they protected us and we're\u00a0not able to do that,\" Stringer said. Watch his interview with Anderson Cooper here:  At least\u00a081\u00a0passengers and crew aboard an\u00a0Australian\u00a0cruise ship off\u00a0the coast of Uruguay, in South America, have tested positive for coronavirus, the cruise company announced on Monday. Australian company Aurora Expeditions, said two crew members and one passenger had been taken off the ship to a hospital in the city of Montevideo as \u201cthey are considered as a higher risk,\" the cruise ship owners said in a statement. Those patients were considered to be a higher risk.\u00a0 More than 120 other passengers and staff were tested for Covid-19, with\u00a081 passengers testing positive and 45 have been tested negative.

Visitors are not allowed to bring chairs, umbrellas, coolers or other items that encourage group activity. \u201cDuring these difficult times, it is vitally important for Georgians to have safe options to maintain their physical and mental health while also abiding by social distancing,\" Kemp said.\u00a0 Kemp said most people followed the rules this weekend and patrols reminded people \"to follow social distancing or disperse.\"\u00a0 He\u00a0issued a shelter-in-place order on April 2, which supersedes all local orders placed previously.\u00a0 Following the order, Georgia Department of Natural Resources signed an\u00a0administrative\u00a0order Friday on the use of beaches in Georgia. Georgia's Tybee Island Mayor, Shirley Sessions, announced in a written statement Saturday that she and the Tybee City Council will pursue legal avenues to overturn Kemp's \"reckless mandate\" to reopen beaches in the state. Children make up less than 2% of reported cases of Covid-19 in the United States for which age was known, according to a new report released today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research, published in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, found 149,082 reported cases between Feb. 12 and April 2 where the patient's age was known, and 2,572 (or 1.7%) were among children younger than 18 years.  Infants younger than 1 year made up 15% of pediatric Covid-19 cases \u2014 or 0.27% of all reported Covid-19 cases with known age. Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in the analysis. Children seemed to have fewer hospitalizations than adults, according to the report: 20% of children for whom hospitalization status was known were hospitalized compared to 33% of 18 to 64-year-old adults with known status.\u00a0 \u201cWhereas most Covid-19 cases in children are not severe, serious Covid-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group,\u201d the report said. \u00a0 However, data were available for a small proportion of patients, said the researchers. For example, hospitalization status was available for 29% of cases in children younger than 18 years and 31% of cases in adults ages 18 to 64 years.\u00a0\u00a0 Some more key findings: Among 345 pediatric cases with information on underlying conditions, 80 (23%) had at least one underlying condition, such as chronic lung disease \u2013 which was most commonly reported \u2013 and cardiovascular disease. \nFor the 295 pediatric cases that had information on both hospitalization status and underlying medical conditions, 28 of 37 (77%) hospitalized children had one or more underlying medical condition \u2013 including all six admitted to an intensive care unit. Children who are less than 1 year made up 59 of the 147 (40%) pediatric hospitalizations and 5 of the 15 (33%) pediatric ICU admissions.\nChildren with Covid-19 might not have reported fever or cough as often as adults, the report also said. Among those with available information, 73% of pediatric patients had symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath, compared to 93% of adults ages 18 to 64 years during the same period. ##Health## The Navy says its prepared to shift course and treat Covid-19 patients aboard the USNS Comfort hospital ship that is docked in New York City. A Navy spokesperson told CNN today: \u201cWe continue working closely with state and local healthcare providers to determine the best way to support New York City, including constant review of procedures for improved admitting and caring for patients onboard. We have not been directed to take COVID-19 patients at this time.\u00a0If we are directed to take COVID-19 positive patients, we are prepared to do so in ways that will limit risk to the crew and other patients onboard.\u201d What's this about: Earlier today, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at press conference that he plans to call President Trump today and ask him to authorize the Navy to treat Covid-19 patients aboard the Comfort.  The original plan was for the the ship to treat non-coronavirus patients to ease the strain on area hospitals seeing an influx of infected patients. Now, Cuomo said he believes the right move is for the ship to utilize its 1000-bed capacity to battle the coronavirus ##Health## The United States has at least 10,335 reported deaths from coronavirus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Andrew Cuomo says he wants local law enforcement to demonstrate \u201cmore aggressive\u201d enforcement of social distancing. He said he is increasing the fine of violating state directives from $500 to $1,000. \u201cIt\u2019s not about your life, you don\u2019t have the right to risk someone else\u2019s life,\u201d the governor said.\u00a0 He added that individuals \u201cdon\u2019t have the right\u201d to take the lives of health care staff and people who are \u201cliterally putting their lives on the line\u201d and be \u201ccavalier or reckless with them.\u201d Watch the moment: ##Daily Life## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that the rate of infection in the state is\u00a0going down, which means that social distancing is working.  \u201cIn any event, plateau or not\u00a0plateau, we have to extend the\u00a0New York pause,\u201d he said at a news conference today. \u201cOne of the reasons the rate of infection is going down is because social distancing is working.\u00a0We have to continue the social\u00a0distancing.\u201d He said there is a \u201cdanger\u201d in being \u201cover-confident,\u201d adding other places have made that mistake \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re not going to make that mistake.\u201d The number of deaths due to coronavirus in New York state has remained \u201ceffectively flat for two days,\u201d he said. New York could be at the apex of coronavirus cases according to new projections shown at a press briefing. Jim Malatras, the president of SUNY Empire State College, said new models show a much lower projection. \u201cThis could suggest that we are\u00a0indeed, potentially, at the\u00a0apex or beginning to be at the apex at\u00a0this moment,\" he said. Some of the initial models predicted that up to 110,000 beds would be needed for coronavirus patients alone, and another that suggested 55,000 beds were needed. Both of the early models showed the peak \u2014 or apex \u2014 occurring at the end of April. Malatras said a new, more optimistic projection can be attributed to social distancing. \u201cWe saw the folks looking at\u00a0those types of model says it was\u00a0going so what activities and\u00a0actions could you take to aggressively lower\u00a0that overall number,\" Malatras said. \"The answer really was, and what the governor\u2019s been doing, was aggressively\u00a0enforce and enact social distancing to\u00a0lower the overall number and this number, and the current\u00a0data suggests that is exactly\u00a0what's happening.\u201d Remember: Malatras said that while the new model is hopeful, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will continue to take it one day at a time. Watch more: \u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended the state's \u201cpause act\u201d \u2013 which closes schools and non-essential businesses \u2014 until April 29th. He said the situation is \u201cturning\u201d and the \u201crate of infection is going down\u201d and that is because \u201csocial distancing is working.\u201d \u201cI know that\u2019s a negative for many many reasons, I know what it does for the economy\u201d but he said since day one he would not choose \u201cbetween public health and economic activity.\u201d ##Daily Life## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he is going to ask the President to shift the USNS Comfort \"from non-Covid to Covid.\" The Navy ship was initially dispatched to New York to treat non-coronavirus patients. \"We don't need the comfort for non-Covid cases,\" the governor said. The Comfort is outfitted with 1,000 hospital beds and is currently docked in New York City. Cuomo said utilizing those beds for coronavirus patients would \"make a significant difference\" for the state. Cuomo said he is going to call Trump today to put in the request. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that new hospitalizations, ICU admissions and daily intubations are all down for the state.  \"Those are all good signs,\" the governor said. He added that those numbers, \"would suggest a possible\u00a0flattening of the curve.\" Here were the number of new hospitalizations in New York over the past three days that the governor reported today: Friday, April 3: 1,095\nSaturday, April 4: 574\nSunday, April 5: 358 See more: At least 130,689 people across New York have tested positive for coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. At least 16,837 people are currently hospitalized. Cuomo said there have been 4,758 deaths \u2014 that's up from 4,159 yesterday. \"Which is effectively flat for two days. While none of this is good news, the flattening, the possible flattening of the curve is better than the increases that we've seen,\" he added. ##Health## Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen believes that unemployment may go to depression levels \u201cfor a time.\u201d In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Yellen called the initial jobless claims \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d and said the unemployment rate is likely at 12% or\u00a013% and moving higher. \u201cI think the toll is continuing to rise and how bad it gets, I think it really depends on how quickly people can get back to business,\u201d\u00a0Yellen said.\u00a0 Yellen also said that the focus should be on testing and getting the pandemic under control. Here's what Yellen said when she was asked about US employment:  \"Well I think that unemployment rates for a time may go to depression levels, but this is very different from the Great Depression or the recession US economy that we experienced in 2009 and after. This is, we started with an economy that was in good shape, with a financial sector that was basically sound and this is a health crisis. It is having severe economic effects but if we are successful in supporting people\u2019s incomes during this time that the government can be, I believe that we\u2019ll be able to get back to a normally functioning economy in much shorter order that during the Great Depression, after the Great Depression or after the Great Recession.\" Italy\u2019s top flight football league, Serie A, recommended that the annual pay of players and coaching staff be cut by as much as a third due to the Coronavirus emergency in the country.\u00a0 Following an emergency General Assembly meeting via video conference on Monday, the League along with 19 clubs unanimously voted to propose \u201ca reduction of 1/3 in total gross annual earnings\" if the season can't be resumed, the league said in a statement. They also recommenced \"a reduction of 1/6 in total gross annual earnings\" if \"the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season can be played in the coming months.\"\u00a0 The statement went on to explain that each club would have to negotiate the cuts with its players and that such a proposal was \u201cnecessary to safeguard the future of the entire Italian football system.\u201d\u00a0 The 2019-20 Serie A season has been suspended indefinitely since March 9. \u201cThe assembly confirmed the desire to play again and finish the season, but without running risks and only when health conditions and government decisions allow,\u201d added Serie A. Gov. Gavin Newsom today announced today that California would loan 500 state-owned ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile inventory.\u00a0 \u201cWe can\u2019t turn our backs on Americans whose lives depend on having a ventilator now,\u201d Newsom said in a press release. Some context: By all accounts, the coronavirus peak has not hit California yet, but the state is lending ventilators while continuing to prepare for the onslaught of patients. The\u00a0famed Masters golf tournament has earmarked a November weekend to hold its 2020 championship.  The Masters was originally slated to tee off this week but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Fred Ridley, the chair of Augusta National Golf Club, the home of the Masters, said in a statement, that the organizers had\u00a0\u201cidentified\u00a0November 9-15 as the intended dates to host the 2020 Masters.\u201d The United States Golf Association has announced that the 120th\u00a0US Open will now tee off in September rather than its original date in June. One of the four annual men\u2019s golf majors, the US Open will still be played at\u00a0Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York. The new dates are September 17 through 20. The USGA also announced that the 2020 US Senior Women\u2019s Open has been canceled. The organization said the men\u2019s 2020 US Senior Open has been postponed to a later date this year. President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday that loans under the program aimed at assisting small businesses impacted by coronavirus reached $38 billion, and he dismissed glitches that hindered the program\u2019s rollout. In an interview with CNBC, Kudlow said, \"the glitches will get worked. It's a monumental undertaking.\" A number of banks said they would not take part in the program during its launch on Friday because the government had failed to provide enough information in advance.\u00a0Trump over the weekend described the rollout as \u201cflawless.\u201d Kudlow says that the President \u201cdoesn't want the cure to be worse than the problem\u201d and asserted that the coronavirus itself must be mitigated before any talk of reopening the economy can be considered.\u00a0 \u201cThe health side has to come first,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cThe health side must continue to come first and the mitigation efforts, we believe, are working.\" He said that the government\u2019s priority remains \u201cphase three\u201d of an assistance program. He also said that the Federal Reserve is likely going to continue rolling out various initiatives aimed at easing the economic crisis, including \u201ca main street lending facility.\u201d Kudlow added that he is interested in selling bonds \"in order to raise money for the war effort, in this case the pandemic effort.\" \u00a0\"Why not sell large bonds, why not go for it in a patriotic way, and an American safety way, and to bring the economy back whenever that can be possible,\u201d he said. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told reporters that the state is running dangerously low on personal protective equipment, also called PPE. \u201cWe are running dangerously low on PPE,\u201d Gov. Whitmer said at a press conference Monday morning. \u201cAt Beaumont Hospital we have less than 3 days until N95 masks run out. At Henry Ford Health System we have less than 4 days. And at the Detroit Medical Center, less than 10 days,\u201d she said. Gov. Whitmer said that there are less than three days left until face shields run out and less than 6 days until surgical gowns run out at all three of those health systems. She added that these data points do not include private donations that are going straight to hospitals. \u201cWe are doing everything that we can at the state level to secure more personal protection equipment. Today we will begin distributing 1.2 million surgical masks that the state has procured on the open market,\u201d Whitmer said.\u00a0 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent 400 ventilators, 1.1 million surgical masks, 232,000 face shields and 2 million gloves. \u201cFEMA will be shipping 1 million more N95 masks to Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties this week,\u201d the governor said.\u00a0 The state is working with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan National Guard to get the TCF Convention Center in Detroit up and running to see patients by Friday. The governor added that Ford and the United Autoworkers have donated thousands of face shields to Michigan hospitals and the state issued the purchase of 1 million face shields from Ford to be delivered over the next 3 weeks.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re making some progress, and that is a good thing, but we need more PPE to continue fighting this virus,\u201d Whitmer said. The 149th\u00a0edition of The Open Championship, one of the four men's annual golf majors, has been canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Royal & Ancient, which plans and organizes the event, announced today.\u00a0 It is the first time that golf\u2019s original and oldest championship, first played in 1860, has been canceled since World War II. The event was scheduled for July 16 through 19 at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. \u201cWe care deeply about this historic Championship and have made this decision with a heavy heart,\" Royal & Ancient Chief Executive Martin Slumbers said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate that this will be disappointing for a great many people around the world but this pandemic is severely affecting the UK and we have to act responsibly. It is the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cI can assure everyone that we have explored every option for playing The Open this year but it is not going to be possible,\u201d he added. Slumbers confirmed that The 149th\u00a0Open will now be played at the historic Sandwich links in July 2021, with the Old Course at St Andrews now hosting The 150th\u00a0Open in July 2022. The championship is the first men's golf major of 2020 to be cancelled outright. In March, both The Masters and the PGA Championship were postponed with a new date for both events yet to be announced. The US Open, though, is still set to be played from June 18 through June 21 at Winged Foot in New York. There are at least\u00a0337,971\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and at least\u00a09,654\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States. The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0Wyoming is the only state or territory that is not reporting a death from coronavirus. \u00a0Find the latest Johns Hopkins University U.S. numbers here. ##Health## JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon used his annual shareholder letter to detail just how bad he thinks the US economy can get from the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Dimon expects a \"bad recession,\" he wrote in the letter released Monday. In the most adverse scenario \u2014 which he said he hopes is unlikely \u2014 gross domestic product could plunge at a 35% annual rate in the second quarter and that a downturn would last through the rest of the year. The unemployment rate would spike as high as 14% in this environment.\u00a0 But Dimon added that \"this scenario is quite severe and, we hope, unlikely.\" And even if the worst case situation bears out, JPMorgan Chase still plans to lend an additional $150 billion to its customers.\u00a0 Still, he said there will be a \"major recession.\" \"Recognizing the extraordinary extension of new credit ... and knowing there will be a major recession mean that we are exposing ourselves to billions of dollars of additional credit losses as we help both consumer and business customers through these difficult times,\" Dimon said in the letter. Dimon stressed that the bank is in solid shape and has a \"fortress\" balance sheet. That is allowing JPMorgan Chase to step up lending to small businesses and consumers in this time of crisis. The bank is now accepting applications for the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program loans after a rocky start to the process Friday morning.\u00a0 Dimon praised the Federal Reserve and other global central bankers \u2014 as well as lawmakers \u2014 for taking quick action to try to stimulate the economy with lower rates and fiscal support for those in need.\u00a0 \"We applaud the speed with which the federal government and the Federal Reserve ... put together a stimulus package and other funding benefits to help individuals, businesses, and state and local entities across the United States and beyond,\" Dimon said. ##Business## Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, said Monday that New York, New Jersey and Detroit will see peaks in hospitalizations and deaths due to coronavirus this week \u2014 and it will happen in other US cities in the weeks to come. In an interview on \"Today,\" Giroir said \"all our predictions, all our models, and we know from the data we see and health care workers we talk to is \u2014 for New York and New Jersey and Detroit, this week is going to be the peak week.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Giroir explained peak \"reflects infections that occurred two or three weeks ago, adding, \"we may be seeing the worst upon us right now in terms of outcomes.\"\u00a0 Giroir said other parts of the US, such as New Orleans, will see a peak in hospitalizations and deaths in the coming weeks. \"We'll see some rolling peaks across the country as the next few weeks unfold,\"\u00a0Giroir told NBC's Savannah Guthrie.\u00a0 ##Health## CVS, in partnership with government agencies, is adding two drive-through coronavirus testing sites less than a week after CNN reported on the anemic progress of a program President Trump touted as part of his solution to expand testing.\u00a0 The retailer announced it\u2019s using a new rapid coronavirus test, which can provide results in less than 15 minutes and was approved by US Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorization last week, according to a company press release.  Its two new locations \u2014 in Georgia and Rhode Island \u2014 will utilize licensed health care providers from its MinuteClinic, the company\u2019s retail medical clinic, to oversee the testing, said the press release.\u00a0The retailer made clear that the sites will not be located at CVS Pharmacy or MinuteClinic locations. Some background: Under fire for the lack of testing, the Trump administration on March 13 announced a public-private partnership between the government and major retailers including CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens. Vice President Mike Pence said the program \"laid the foundation\" to help meet the nation's testing needs by giving a \"little bit of their parking lot so that people can come by and do a drive-by test.\" But the administration\u2019s celebrated announcement hasn't come close to being fulfilled. While these retailers have approximately 30,000 locations combined, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed last week that only five locations from these major retailers were offering drive-thru testing \u2014 and none are open to the general public at the time. Instead, the sites were only testing healthcare workers and first responders. The one site CVS previously opened in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts was also testing senior citizens with symptoms.\u00a0 After\u00a0CNN\u2019s story\u00a0on March 31, Walmart announced a plan to open a drive-thru coronavirus testing site for first responders and healthcare workers in Arkansas \u2014 it\u2019s third location in the U.S.\u00a0 For its two new locations, CVS will not be using its parking lot. Instead it worked with local government officials to identify parking lots that are easily accessible and able to accommodate multiple lanes of cars at one time: one at a multi-level parking garage at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The other \u2014 in Rhode Island \u2014 will be located at Twin Rivers Casino.\u00a0\u00a0 Unlike previously opened testing drive throughs, the new CVS locations will be testing a broader population. People who meet US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, in addition to state residency and age guidelines, are eligible for testing.\u00a0Patients will need to pre-register in advance online at\u00a0CVS.com\u00a0in order to schedule a same-day time slot for testing, said the release.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report France is heading for the worst economic downturn since World War II, the country\u2019s Minister of the Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire says. In a Senate hearing today, he said the economy\u2019s worst year since the war was during the 2009 financial crisis when it contracted by 2.9 percent. \u201cWe are likely to be well beyond -2.9% this year,\u201d Le Maire said. He had previously warned that the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic would be brutal. ##Business## US stocks rallied at Monday\u2019s open following some encouraging data that showed a slowdown in coronavirus infections in multiple countries. Here's what happened at the opening: The Dow opened up 4.4%, or 900 points.\nThe S&P 500 kicked off nearly 4% higher.\nThe Nasdaq Composite opened up 3.8%. \u00a0This is a shortened week, as exchanges are closed for Good Friday. ##Business##\u00a0 A US Navy official tells CNN that 173 crew members of the USS Theodore Roosevelt\u00a0have now tested positive for coronavirus.\u00a0 About 61% of the crew has been tested. Approximately 2,000 people have been evacuated from the ship and moved ashore.\u00a0 Remember: The Navy said it wanted to move 2,700 ashore by Friday so they are still behind schedule. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said he was qualified to engage and disagree with Dr. Anthony Fauci on the use of an anti-malarial drug as a coronavirus treatment \u2014 which is not yet proven as effective.\u00a0 \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cI have a Ph.D. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever,\" he added. CNN previously reported that a heated argument broke out in the Situation Room over the weekend, where Navarro feuded with other officials on the unproven efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus, according to sources. While discussing the latest on the anti-malaria drug, an exasperated Navarro lashed out at Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, who has urged\u00a0caution around the drug. Watch the moment: Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for US Department of Health and Human Services, acknowledged that \"testing is tight\" for Covid-19. \"There's no question that testing is tight, but there are enough tests out there for people who need the test to get the test,\" Giroir said on the \"Today\" show this morning.\u00a0 \"We are really going hospital to hospital to try to assure that the tests are available and I'm meeting with hospital associations from all the metroplex areas,\" Giroir added. He said there would be \"a million-plus\" tests this week. \"We are not going to have tens of millions of tests this week \u2014 but we will have a million-plus tests, plus all the thousands of hospitals who do their own tests. That should be efficient to take care of the load we're going to see this week.\" ##Health## Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, urged the country to continue social distancing efforts.\u00a0\u00a0 \"If we let our foot off the gas and start doing things that are ill-advised, we could have another peak in a few weeks,\" he said in an interview on the \"Today\" show.\u00a0 Over the weekend by Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator,  urged Americans to stay home, saying \"This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store, not going to the pharmacy.\" Giroir said he agreed with Birx, and explained, \"That does not mean go without medication. If you need to go to the pharmacy to get your medications, if you need to get groceries, do it. But don't go every day ... Do it as infrequently as possible.\" \"Anything you can do to protect yourself, to avoid yourself from getting this virus and being in the hospital for a month or potentially facing death, I think it's advised to do that,\" Giroir told NBC's Savannah Guthrie.\u00a0 ##Health## Miami is the cruising capital of the world, with millions of passengers traveling through the Port of Miami every year. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new rules for cruise line passengers overnight, requiring people to travel by charter flight and private transportation. Upon arrival home, the traveler must isolate for 14 days. And South Florida could be the area of the country that is most impacted by the new CDC guidelines.\u00a0 The USCG announced this weekend that 114 cruise ships with 93,000 crew members on board were off the coast of the United States. The overwhelming majority of them \u2013 up to 90 \u2013 are in the Miami USCG area of responsibility, per USCG.\u00a0\u00a0 Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, expressed concern in a press conference this weekend, saying that he is trying to talk to the cruise lines to get crew members home. \u201cWhat we were trying to do with a cruise ships is a lot of them are out there with their crew and we're trying to tell the cruise industries, they need to start getting those\u00a0healthy crew members, off the ships and just keep a very,\u00a0very\u00a0skeleton crew to operate the ship so that if anything does happen on any particular ship, the exposure to people is a heck of a lot less,\u201d Gimenez said. ##Travel## Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, reregistered as a medical practitioner last month to assist during the coronavirus crisis, a spokesperson for his office said on Monday. \"Dr Varadkar rejoined the Medical Register last month. He has offered his services to the HSE [Irish\u00a0Health Service Executive] for one session a week in areas that are within his scope of practice,\" the Taoiseach spokesman said.\u00a0 Varadkar worked as a doctor before leaving medicine to work in politics. He was removed from the medical register in 2013 and became prime minister in 2017.\u00a0 \"Many of his family and friends are working in the health service. He wanted to help out even in a small way,\" the spokesman said. Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for US Department of Health and Human Services, touted efforts to ramp up testing during an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Monday. Still, there continue to be reports in the United States of a shortage of Covid-19 testing kits at hospitals. \"We've done over 1.67 million tests to\u00a0date and this week we're going to have at least a million tests done and that's not even counting the thousands of hospital laboratories that do their own tests. So tests have ramped up dramatically in the past couple of weeks,\" Giroir\u00a0told NBC's Savannah Guthrie. \"This\u00a0week we'll have at least 250,000 of the Abbott point-of-care tests out,\" Giroir said. \"So this is being remedied very quickly.\" Some context: In late March, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized that Abbott Laboratories coronavirus test for emergency use, which can provide results in less than 15 minutes, using the same technology that powers some rapid flu tests.\u00a0 Giroir continued: \"Everyone who needs a test can get a test this week \u2014 if you're hospitalized, if you're a health care worker, if you're elderly and have symptoms \u2014 but we're not to the stage where tens of millions of people can get tests.\"  ##Health## British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had \u201ca comfortable night\u201d and remains under observation at a London hospital, a 10 Downing Street spokesperson said on Monday.\u00a0 Johnson is suffering from \u201cpersistent\u201d Covid-10 symptoms and was admitted to St Thomas\u2019 hospital for tests on Sunday night as a \u201cprecaution.\u201d  Johnson is in \"good spirits,\" according to the spokesperson, who declined questions about whether the prime minister receiving oxygen treatment.

We want to limit the number of cases before this happens, especially by flattening the curve,\" according to the prime minister's office on Twitter. We are preparing for a long fight with this epidemic,\" he added. Poland has 4,201 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 98 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0 The number of new coronavirus infections is decreasing in \u201cpractically all\u201d regions across Spain, Maria Jose Sierra, an official from the country\u2019s center for health emergencies said at a briefing on Monday. \u201cIt is important that a few days pass to confirm this tendency, but the data allows us to observe that the growth rate of the coronavirus pandemic is decreasing in practically all [Spanish] communities,\u201d Sierra said. Spain coronavirus outbreak slows down further: The coronavirus outbreak in Spain continues to slow down, with Health Ministry figures showing 637 have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,055 deaths. That represents a rise of 5.1% on Sunday\u2019s numbers, the lowest daily rise, percentage-wise, since early March. Heath workers infected: Around 19,400 Spanish health workers, including doctors and nurses, have been infected with the novel coronavirus, Sierra added. That means health workers account for almost 15% of the total number of infections in Spain. ##Health## America's hospitals are dealing with \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cwidespread\u201d shortages of needed medical supplies, hampering the ability to test and respond to coronavirus adequately and protect medical staff,\u00a0according to a new report\u00a0from a government inspector general. The findings by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services describe a dire situation for front line doctors and medical stuff as cases mount in hospitals.  The assessment, the first internal government look at the response, were based on interviews from March 23-27\u00a0with administrators from more than 300 hospitals across 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. US edging towards 10,000 deaths: The US surgeon general\u00a0said this week\u00a0is going to be the \"hardest and the saddest\" for \"most Americans' lives.\" The US has recorded\u00a0more than 337,000 cases\u00a0and over 9,600 deaths. ##Health## Police in Pakistan have arrested dozens of doctors and medical staff protesting a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) in their fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The demonstrations took place in the city of Quetta in Pakistan\u2019s southwestern province of Balochistan.

He is the first major Arab politician to die of Covid-19. The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said Jibril died after a \u201cbattle with the coronavirus infection.\u201d \u201cDr. Jibril was particularly dedicated to building civil society and promoting the inclusion of women and young Libyans in politics. Dr. Jibril was a friend and mentor to many and participated most recently in the UN-facilitated Political Dialogue Forum. He will be greatly missed,\u201d Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNSMIL Stephanie Williams said in a statement Sunday. Here's some background: On March 27, the NFA announced that Jibril tested positive for Covid-19, adding that he was in \u201cstable health on the course to recovery.\u201d Jibril, 67, served as interim Prime Minister of the opposition government that led the country\u00a0through\u00a0the civil war until the first post-Gadhafi elections were held in 2012.

Without citing evidence, he said it's a \"great\" and \"powerful\" anti-malaria drug \"and there are signs that it works on this, some very strong signs.\" Japan will declare state of emergency: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will declare a state of emergency on Tuesday, lasting for approximately one month. The news comes after 378 new cases and three more deaths in Japan were announced Sunday.\u00a0 Spain coronavirus outbreak slows down further: The coronavirus outbreak in Spain continues to slow down, with Health Ministry figures showing 637 have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,055 deaths. That represents a rise of 5.1% on Sunday\u2019s numbers, the lowest daily rise, percentage-wise, since early March. The novel coronavirus outbreak in Spain continues to slow down, with figures released by the Spanish Health Ministry showing 637 have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,055 deaths. That represents a rise of 5.1% on Sunday\u2019s numbers, the lowest daily rise, percentage-wise, since early March. The Ministry\u2019s data shows there are now 81,540 active cases, an increase of 1,279 from Saturday \u2013 the smallest daily rise since March 14. The rise in the number of new cases has been declining in percentage terms since March 24. Slowing rate of infection: While the number of active cases continues to rise, the rate of increase continues to slow. There was also a slowdown in the number of people admitted to intensive care units in the past 24 hours, with Spanish authorities counting only 70 new cases -- the lowest increase since March 16. Some 40,437 people have now recovered from the virus, the health ministry also reported. There are at least\u00a0337,646\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the U.S, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States. At least\u00a09,648\u00a0people have died in the U.S. from coronavirus.\u00a0 The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases. Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Large numbers of people flocked to popular tourists sites and major cities across China over the country's holiday weekend, despite warnings from health authorities that the risk posed by\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0remains far from over. Images from the Huangshan mountain park in Anhui province on Saturday April 4 showed thousands of people crammed together, many wearing face masks, eager to experience the great outdoors after months of travel restrictions and strict lockdown measures. Such was the rush to get into the popular tourist spot, that at 7.48 a.m., authorities took the unusual step of issuing a notice declaring that the park had reached its 20,000 person daily capacity, and would not be accepting any more visitors, according to\u00a0state media Global Times. Restaurants and parks packed: Meanwhile in Shanghai, the famous Bund waterfront was packed with shoppers and tourists, after weeks of being near deserted. Many of the city's restaurants that were shuttered only days ago also appeared to be doing a brisk trade, with several requiring reservations. A similar story played out in the capital Beijing, with locals flocking to the city's parks and open spaces. Caution urged: The abrupt return to apparent normality comes more than three months after the virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The outbreak, which has since spread around the world infecting more than a million people, saw much of China brought to a near standstill in an effort to contain transmissions. At its peak, thousands of new cases were recorded in China every day. However, in recent weeks the rate of infection has slowed significantly. On Monday, China reported just 39 new cases, all but one of which were imported. To date, China has recorded 82,641 cases and 3,335 deaths. But while the government is slowly relaxing restrictions, Chinese health experts have urged the public to continue to practice caution. Read the full story: South Korea\u2019s football captain, Son Heung-Min, will carry out mandatory military service with the Marine Corps in his homeland as football\u2019s coronavirus shutdown continues, his agent has confirmed to CNN. The 27-year-old returned to South Korea on Saturday 28 March and is in the process of completing his 14 days in self-quarantine. \u201cHe will move to Jeju Island as soon as he has completed self-quarantine, and will receive three weeks of basic military training at the 9th\u00a0Brigade of the Marine Corps beginning on 20th\u00a0April,\u201d said his agent.\n\u201cBasic military training in the army is usually scheduled for four weeks, but the Navy (the Marine Corps) has been changed to three weeks from 2019,\u201d he added. Military service: Under South Korean law, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 35 are required to perform at least 21 months of military service. However, any South Korean athletes who win Olympic medals or Asian Games titles are exempt from military conscription. Son, who represents English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur at club-level, earned his exemption in 2018 when he led South Korea to win the football gold medal at the Asian Games in Indonesia. Despite the exemption, athletes are still required by law to serve a mandatory four-week national service in the South Korean military \u2013 albeit with the Marine Corps being an exception of three-weeks. Premier League suspended: On Friday it was confirmed the England\u2019s Premier League season had been indefinitely suspended amid the ongoing pandemic with the League announcing it would resume play \u201conly when it is safe and appropriate to do so.\u201d Spanish-bought ventilators and other medical equipment held in Ankara by Turkish authorities will take off for Spain on Monday, Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said in an interview with Spanish network Antena 3.\u00a0 The equipment is expected to be available for distribution among regional governments in Spain on Tuesday. The ventilators, produced by a company in Turkey, have been held by local authorities in Ankara since Friday.\u00a0 On Friday, the foreign minister said the ventilators would not arrive on time because \u201cthe Turkish government understands that they are a priority for the treatment of its patients.\u201d  However, Ankara said that the exporting company lacked the proper authorization because Turkey introduced strict controls on the export of medical equipment a month ago, as the novel coronavirus in the country started to worsen. The situation was resolved late on Saturday, with the Spanish foreign minister tweeting thanks to her Turkish counterpart for authorizing the export.  \u201cWe will always stand by our friend Spain,\u201d Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted back. \u201cWe will overcome these difficult times together.\u201d ##Health## Austria will gradually reopen shops after Easter, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Monday. Smaller shops, DIY shops and garden shops will reopen as of April 14, Kurz said at a press conference.\u00a0 All shops, shopping centers and hairdressers will open as of May 1, while restaurants and hotels will open in mid-May at the earliest, in a step-by-step system. No major events will be held until the end of June, Kurz said. There will be home-schooling until the middle of May, and decisions on schooling will be made towards the end of April.  Kurz added that social distancing and the wearing of masks must be adhered to where necessary. The situation in Austria: There have been more than 12,000 confirmed cases in Austria, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. At least 200 people have died.  ##Daily Life## Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said governments are \u201cfighting\u201d over medical supplies to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cPeople are fighting over the products to fight the coronavirus,\u201d she said in an interview with Spanish broadcaster Antena 3, explaining that the country is looking for alternative producers as the main global supplier is not able to meet demand. \n\u201cThe Chinese market is very complicated because the demand is much greater than the supply,\" she said. The foreign minister said that Spain was prioritizing contracts with \u201cexclusive\u201d supplies but also incentivizing local companies to produce some of the equipment instead of buying it from abroad. \u201cNational production is a very important aspect and will allow us not only to tackle the coronavirus on national territory but also to help other countries that do not have that many resources,\u201d she said. ##Business## Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will declare a state of emergency on Tuesday, lasting for approximately one month, he announced Monday.  Abe will hold a press conference on Tuesday to further explain the declaration.\u00a0 A different tactic: Abe says Japan\u2019s state of emergency will differ from Western countries, adding that \"basic economic activity\" will continue, giving examples including public transportation and supermarkets.  The Prime Minister\u2019s advisory committee recommended that a state of emergency be declared for seven Japanese prefectures, including the Japanese capital of Tokyo and its second largest city Osaka. The full list of prefectures affected is: Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka. Economic relief: Abe also announced details of a massive JPY \u00a5108 trillion (USD $989 billion) economic stimulus package. The size of the economic relief package \u2014 20-percent of Japan\u2019s GDP \u2014 is unprecedented. The stimulus includes JPY \u00a56 trillion (USD $54 billion) in cash handouts for families who have lost significant income and small business owners. Also included, JPY \u00a526 trillion (USD $238 billion) in extension of deadlines for tax and social welfare payments. Zero-interest loans will also be provided to private financial institutions, but Abe did not specify the amount. This post has been corrected to better reflect the details of Japan\u2019s stimulus package. ##Daily Life## Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says the economic damage caused by the UK\u2019s social distancing rules and government-mandated shutdown of some businesses is \u201cenormous\u201d and could eventually affect the county\u2019s ability to run its health-care system. \u201cI am terrified by the economic damage we are doing every week this lockdown continues,\u201d Blair told BBC radio on Monday.\n\u201cIf it goes on for a long period of time, then that economic damage doesn\u2019t just affect the economy per se, it also affects your ability to operate your health-care system effectively.\u201d Blair said the only real way to ease the restrictions is to dramatically increase the number of coronavirus tests being carried out. \u201cIf I was handling this situation now I think I would put a senior minister in charge of testing and nothing else,\u201d he said, adding that the minister would need to be supported with business and technology experts to advise on how to increase testing rates to an industrial scale. \u201cUnless you\u2019re able to get mass testing -- at scale, with speed -- I don\u2019t see how you get a way out of this lockdown.\u201d ##Daily Life## ##Business## If you're just joining us now, here's what has happened since our last catch-up. Boris Johnson in hospital: The British prime minister was admitted to hospital yesterday for tests, but continues to lead the government, authorities said today. Johnson tested positive for coronavirus on March 27, and is still experiencing symptoms 10 days later, so went to the hospital as a \"precautionary step.\" Scottish scandal: Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer resigned after being caught leaving her home without a proper excuse. Police issued her with a formal warning on Sunday for breaking Scotland\u2019s strict measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus. Irish leader steps in: Ireland's Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar, a former doctor, has rejoined the medical register and will work one shift a week to help out,\u00a0according\u00a0to national\u00a0broadcaster RTE. Spike in Japan: Japan's health ministry announced 378 new cases and three more deaths nationwide by the end of Sunday. A US military commander in Japan declared a public health emergency for military bases today, citing the rise in cases in nearby Tokyo. Controversial drug: India has imposed a blanket export ban on a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump as possible therapy for coronavirus. This ban comes just as Trump called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release more of the drug to the US. And finally, some good news: The Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are both essential workers, so they are exempt from movement restrictions, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told children today. But they may be busy with their own families during this pandemic -- so if children aren't visited by the Bunny this year, they could organize their own social distancing version of an Easter egg hunt, she suggested. ##Health## ##Daily Life## President Donald Trump called Britain's Queen Elizabeth II \"a great and wonderful woman\" on Twitter, after the Queen recorded a rare televised address to the nation broadcast on Sunday. The Queen typically only speaks to the public during her annual Christmas message, or when there is a new parliament installed. The Queen's message: She urged unity and offered reassurance for the nation during her speech. \"Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,\" the\u00a0Queen said. \"\u00a0I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.\" She thanked those who were staying at home and following social distancing rules, as well as frontline workers and medical staff. Contrast in the US: Trump's praise of the Queen comes as the US struggles with its own outbreak, and as the President faces sharp criticism for his handling of the crisis. He has sent mixed messages to the public over the past month, offering misleading information on testing, ventilator supply, and the pandemic's timeline. Trump has also contradicted medical and scientific experts on his own White House task force, and urged the economy to resume operations by Easter -- which is this coming weekend. \"We have to open this country up,\" he said last week --  even as doctors warn the nation will see a\u00a0massive spike in cases if Americans return to crowded workplaces or events. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Colombian President Ivan Duque called for solidarity and support for more than a million Venezuelan migrants who have been hit hard by the impacts of coronavirus,\u00a0during a Facebook Live session on Sunday. About 600 Venezuelan citizens crossed the Colombian border into Venezuela on Saturday, according to\u00a0Migracion Colombia, Colombia\u2019s Immigration Authority. They\u00a0were received by officials from the Administrative Service of Identification, Migration and Immigration of Venezuela.\u00a0 Colombia\u2019s quarantine measures during the outbreak have left many Venezuelan citizens in the country without a source of income. Duque said Colombia will help the migrants despite the difficulties caused by the outbreak, \"especially those with the most vulnerable conditions, being able to receive food and some protection at this time.\"  He said the government would continue making progress in food aid and protection programs to help the nearly 1.7 million displaced Venezuelans. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## Switzerland reported 822 more cases of coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the national total to 21,100, according to the Swiss Federal Office for Health. At least 559 people have died from the virus.  The Swiss authority said that there are 246 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. \u201cSwitzerland now has one of the highest incidences (246/100,000) in Europe,\u201d said a statement on the health authority's website.  ##Health## Dr.\u00a0Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi says that the most important way to stop a coronavirus outbreak in India's slums will be to get community participation. \"In my mind the control of the disease is going to be through the community rather than through the hospitals,\" Guleria said, speaking to CNN on Monday. Efforts to stop the coronavirus from spreading in Mumbai's densely populated Dharavi slum are being ramped up after several cases and one death were confirmed there last week. Quarantining not possible in a slum: Guleria said it is impossible for people there to isolate themselves at home.  \"If you have a number of people living in one room, its not possible for them to have home quarantine or self-quarantine. So a facility that can put them up for two weeks so they don't spread the virus in their community is something that needs to be looked at,\" Guleria said.  Lockdown showing signs of helping: India is entering its second week of a 21-day nationwide lockdown, and Guleria recommended that more aggressive restrictions may be needed in hotspot areas. \"We could look at a graded lockdown in some areas -- where the infections are lower based on the data, the lockdown may be partially lifted. But in the hotspots where we have a large number of cases being picked up, I think we will need to look at a more aggressive lockdown so that community spread can be stopped in these areas,\" he said.  Can India cope? On whether the country has enough hospital resources to cope with a large outbreak, Guleria said that while resources \"are going to be strained,\" India has had a few weeks to prepare.  \"What advantage we have had is that we\u2019ve had time over the past few weeks to start preparing. And a lot of work has gone in to prepare a lot of Covid hospitals facilities, whether it be PPEs, ventilators, or whether it be trying to train our doctors, to manage this. \n\"We need to see how we can flatten the curve because if we have these huge surge of cases that are happening in the US, it\u2019s going to be a big problem as far as India is concerned,\" he said.  ##Health## ##Daily Life## UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in charge of the British government from hospital, housing minister\u00a0Robert Jenrick said on Monday.\u00a0 Johnson was admitted to the hospital on Sunday night in what Downing Street said was a \"precautionary step\" after continuing to experience coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive on March 27.  \"I know for him personally it will be very frustrating that he's had to go to the hospital to have these tests, and he'll want to be back in Number 10 leading from the front, which is his way,\" said Jenrick on the BBC's Today program. \"But he remains in charge of the government and he will be updated regularly in the hospital, as he has been while he was self-isolating.\" UK foreign minister Dominic Raab will chair the regular morning meetings for the government, Jenrick said.\u00a0 He added that it \"wasn't an emergency admission.\" \"It was a planned admission, in order to have some routine tests. Those tests are underway and he'll stay in hospital as long as he needs to do that. But I've heard that he's doing well, and I very much look forward to him being back in Number 10 as soon as possible,\" Jenrick said. ##Health## Scotland\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Catherine Calderwood has resigned after being caught leaving her home without a proper excuse during the coronavirus pandemic. Calderwood initially said in a news conference apologizing for her actions that she intended to stay in the role. But by late Sunday night, she had resigned \u201cwith a heavy heart.\" \u201cThe justifiable focus on my behaviour risks becoming a distraction from the hugely important job that government and the medical profession has to do in getting the country through this coronavirus pandemic,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\u201cHaving worked so hard on the government's response, that is the last thing I want.\u201d Calderwood was photographed by a Scottish newspaper near her second home, in a different part of the country from her Edinburgh address. Police issued her with a formal warning on Sunday for breaking Scotland\u2019s strict measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus. Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Monday that she had hoped that Calderwood would be able to stay in the position, \"because at this point in dealing with the pandemic, continuity of advice from somebody who\u2019s been immersed in this from the very outset was very important.\" \u201cBy last night, it became very clear to me that whatever the risk of that was \u2026 it was outweighed by the risk of our message being crowded out and undermined,\" Sturgeon said.  \u00a0##Health## ##Daily Life## Ireland's Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar has rejoined the medical register and will work one shift a week to help out during the coronavirus pandemic, according to national\u00a0broadcaster RTE. Varadkar worked as a doctor for seven years before becoming a politician. He left the medical profession in 2013.  RTE reported that he reregistered as a doctor in March and offered his services to the country\u2019s Health Service Executive (HSE) for one session a week. Varadkar will carry out phone assessments to free up staff for frontline work, according to RTE.  ##Health## Home to around 1 million people, Dharavi in Mumbai is one of Asia's largest slums -- and a coronavirus outbreak there could become unmanageable.  But the slum may be the site of the first self-sufficient model in India for the identification, quarantine, and treatment of coronavirus, according to a senior municipality official. Since a 56-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday and succumbed to the disease later that evening, four more coronavirus cases have been identified in Dharavi.\u00a0 \"Even though the number of cases is low at this stage, everybody is anticipating a big outbreak in Dharavi. The municipal commissioner visited the area today to take stock of the situation,\" said Kiran Dighavkar, an official with Mumbai's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).\u00a0 The Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex in the area has been converted into a 300-bed quarantine facility for high-risk patients, while efforts to fight the virus are being ramped up. Boosting the response in Dharavi:  On Sunday, the BMC acquired\u00a0a 51-bed hospital, along with its entire medical\u00a0staff, to exclusively quarantine asymptomatic coronavirus patients from Dharavi, Dighavkar said.\u00a0\nA team of 274 health-care workers, who had worked on a polio vaccine drive, have been deployed in Dharavi to identify and test potential contacts. \nA pathology lab near Dharavi has offered to test samples from the slum and lab officials will receive training by BMC doctors on Monday. \nFifteen doctors from the Doctors Association of India have also come forward to set up a health camp to screen residents of Dharavi for the virus, Dighavkar said.\u00a0 \"With everyone coming forward to offer their services, Dharavi can become a self-sufficient model for dealing with the coronavirus. However, all critical cases still go to Kasturba Hospital (the first hospital in Mumbai that began treating coronavirus patients),\" Dighavkar added.\u00a0 ##Health## New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was asked a slightly more unusual question about the nationwide lockdown at a news conference today. \"We've had some correspondence from some younger viewers who are quite concerned about the Easter Bunny,\" asked a journalist at the conference. \"Have you considered any exemptions for the Easter Bunny? Because of course he would be breaking the bubble.\" The \"bubble\" refers to the idea that New Zealanders should stay within their own bubbles, composed of people in their household -- and not go out or enter neighbors' and friends' bubbles during the lockdown. \"You'll be pleased to know that we consider both the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to be essential workers,\" replied Ardern. \"But as you can imagine, at this time, of course they're going to be potentially quite busy at home with their family as well and their own bunnies. So I say to the children of New Zealand, if the Easter Bunny doesn't make it to your household, we have to understand that it's a bit difficult at the moment perhaps for the Bunny to get everywhere.\" Ardern suggested that if the Easter Bunny can't make it to children's homes this year, they could instead draw Easter eggs and tape them to the front windows of their homes, so neighborhood children can have their own social-distancing Easter egg hunt. New Zealand has been under lockdown since March 25. The country has reported 1,106 coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. ##Daily Life## Japan's health ministry announced 378 new cases of coronavirus and three more deaths nationwide by the end of Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total number of cases in the country has risen to 4,366, 712 of which were from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Some 84 people have died from the disease in the country, 11 of whom were linked to the ship.  ##Health## India has placed a blanket ban on all exports of hydroxychloroquine, just as President Donald Trump called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release more of the drug to the United States. In an official notification issued Saturday, India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry amended a previous order issued last month and effectively banned all export of the drug.\u00a0It is unclear whether the export ban was made before or after Trump and Modi spoke in a telephone call on Saturday. \u201cThe export of Hydroxychloroquine and formulations made from Hydroxychloroquine, therefore, shall remain prohibited, without any exception,\u201d stated the notification. Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malaria drug that some institutions are researching for a possible Covid-19 treatment. Yet there is little reliable evidence that the drug is effective at treating the novel coronavirus.  President Trump, however, has doubled down on the\u00a0unproven therapy, and at a briefing at the White House on Sunday said: \"They (India) make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine -- very large amounts frankly.\u00a0And I said -- they had a hold because you know they have 1.5 billion people and they take a lot of it, and I said I would appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered and they are giving it serious consideration. But India makes a lot of it.\u201d  In India, the eligible individuals for use of the drug are \"Asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 and asymptomatic household contacts of people testing positive for Covid-19.\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there is no \"definitive information to be able to make any comment\" on whether the drug can be used to treat coronavirus. For more on hydroxychloroquine, read here: ##Health## ##Business## In mid-March, when we strolled Shanghai\u2019s usually bustling West Bund park by the river, it was nearly deserted. The only people we saw were either the occasional local or expats walking their pets. You could sit on the grass and still keep a safe distance from your fellow visitors. But on Saturday, during the three-day Qingming public holiday, every inch of the park was packed. There was so little space on the grass that some groups were hovering, picnic blankets ready, to claim their space. With the lure of spring weather and a day off, crowds walked shoulder to shoulder, far closer than the recommended six feet (1.8 meters) of social distancing. Most people wore masks, but there were some who were daring enough to go barefaced. Walking through the area, we saw local families sharing a meal, groups of kids playing basketball and dogs weaving in and out of the crowds of people, chasing each other. On Nanjing Road, a popular shopping district which was deserted a month ago, customers flooded in and out of stores -- a happy sight for the Chinese government, which is desperate to get the country\u2019s economy humming again. But for me, the crowds\u00a0brought mixed emotions. While it is nice to see people happy and celebrating that the worst of the outbreak may be behind them, part of me does worry just how safe it is. Can the epidemic really be over already? Or are we witnessing the start of the next outbreak within the now-walled off country? How long can this freedom last? David Culver is CNN's international correspondent, based in Beijing. He discusses concerns over Beijing's transparency about the virus here: ##Daily Life## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released\u00a0instructions and visual tutorials on how to make cloth face coverings\u00a0from common household materials. The CDC recently released guidance recommending the use of cloth face coverings \"in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas of significant community based transmission.\" Cloth face coverings, according to the CDC, can be homemade out of pieces of fabric, T-shirts, bandannas and coffee filters to slow down the spread of the virus, especially those that may be asymptomatic and capable of transmitting it to others despite experiencing no symptoms.\u00a0 The CDC recommended any homemade cloth face coverings include multiple layers of fabric, be secured to the ears, and allow for breathing without restriction. The guidance recommends routinely cleaning coverings in a washing machine and that no child under the age of 2 should wear them. ##Daily Life## ##Health## The commander of the United States Forces Japan (USFJ) has announced a public health emergency for the Kanto Plains region due to rising coronavirus cases in nearby Tokyo, the army unit said in a statement Monday. The order, which will remain in effect through May 5, allows commanders the authority to enforce compliance of health protection measures on those who live and work on US installations. \"Protecting the health and safety of everyone associated with US Forces Japan is my number one priority,\" USFJ commander Lt. Gen. Kevin Schneider said, adding\u00a0that the order will cover all Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine installations and facilities in the area.\n\"I cannot underscore enough the importance of personal responsibility at a time like this. Stopping the spread of COVID-19 requires the entire team -- service members, civilians, families, and our Japanese partners,\" he added. An active duty member of the USFJ tested positive for the coronavirus a few weeks ago.  The move comes as the daily count of new coronavirus cases in Tokyo doubled in the past week, and there are concerns that the country isn't doing enough to halt the spread of the virus.

Spike in Singapore: Singapore saw 120 new cases of coronavirus in 24 hours this weekend -- its biggest daily jump so far. Slowdowns in Thailand and Korea: Thailand reported 51 new cases today -- a sharp drop from the 102 reported yesterday. And South Korea reported 47 new cases today -- the lowest number of new daily cases since mid-February. Australia takes action: Sydney is closing more beaches due to crowds defying social distancing rules. And police in New South Wales state have launched an investigation into the docking and disembarking of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which created a major cluster of cases. In the UK: On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests. He  tested positive for the coronavirus on March 27. Meanwhile, the Queen gave a rare televised address to the nation, offering reassurance and urging unity. Singer-songwriter\u00a0Christopher Cross revealed on social media\u00a0that he tested positive for\u00a0coronavirus. Cross, known for his Grammy Award-winning hits \"Sailing\" and \"Arthur's Theme,\"\u00a0said that he felt it was important to make people aware of how dangerous the virus is. Cross implored his followers to self-quarantine, wash their hands frequently and avoid touching their faces to help stop the virus' spread. \"For those of you who still do not believe the COVID-19 virus is real, or think it is a 'hoax' or part of some conspiracy, my advice to you is to understand right now that this is a deadly illness spreading like wildfire throughout the world,\" Cross said on Instagram.

The investigation will \"fully examine\" the communications and actions that allowed passengers to disembark from the cruise ship in Sydney on March 19, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said in a statement.\u00a0 It is expected that the investigation will involve interviewing thousands of witnesses, including the ship's captain, doctors, crew members, and passengers, and officials from the federal and state government. \u201cAfter reviewing the information at hand, the only way I can determine whether our national biosecurity laws or our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation,\" Fuller said. Here's what the NSW Department of Health said last Friday: \"No cases of Covid-19 were identified\" at the time when the ship docked.\nThe vast majority of passengers did not report symptoms until after leaving the ship. \nAs of last Friday, at least 342 people are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19 from the ship, it added. Up to 200 of the 1,040 crew members onboard the ship have displayed coronavirus-like symptoms, while 16 have returned positive results for Covid-19, NSW Police said. Meanwhile, the Ruby Princess will continue to berth at Port Kembla for up to 10 days to allow for safer access for medical assessments, NSW police said Monday.  Health authorities will carry out \"medical assessments,\u00a0treatment, or emergency extractions of her crew,\" according to a police statement. \"The berthing will be conducted under strict health and biosecurity guidelines and will not pose a risk to employees at the port or the broader community,\" the statement adds. \"She will also be refueling and restocking provisions, as required for her home journey.\" Crew members will not be allowed to disembark unless in an emergency and approved by the police commissioner. ##Travel## ##Health## ##Travel## India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced on Monday that 4,067 people in total have tested positive for novel coronavirus.

The US now has more than four times China's total cases, and is the worst-hit country. This is how the pandemic looks around the world: Chaos in the US: The US has more than 337,000 cases, with New York at the epicenter. Most of the country is under movement restrictions, with people ordered to stay at home except for essential reasons. Emergency personnel and medical staff have spoken of insufficient resources, war-like conditions, exhaustion and fear. In one New York hospital, six patients went into cardiac arrest and four died within 40 minutes.\nChina returns to normal life: The past few weeks have seen the rate of new daily cases drop dramatically in mainland China, according to government figures. Yesterday, China reported 39 new cases nationwide and just one death -- a striking contrast to the thousands of new cases reported each day during the peak in February. Restrictions are now lifting and people are returning to normal life; photos this weekend show hikers crammed onto a famous mountain.\nControversy in Japan: The daily count of new coronavirus cases in Japan has doubled in the past week. Many have criticized the government's handling of the crisis: the Prime Minister has repeatedly refused to declare a state of emergency or lock down Tokyo, and patients have had difficulty getting tested. To make things worse, people are reluctant to work from home, continue to gather outside, and are commuting during rush hours.\nSlowdown in parts of Europe: Spain, Italy, Germany, and France are the four countries with the highest number of cases after the US. But evidence suggests the worst may have passed for some of these places; yesterday Spain saw the lowest rise in deaths since early March. Meanwhile, the mood in the UK is grim, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted to hospital and the Queen giving a rare national address.\nCases spike in Iran: Iran, which became the epicenter of the Middle East outbreak in March, is still seeing high numbers -- 2,483 new cases in 24 hours were reported yesterday. Despite this, the President said yesterday that foreign media \"exaggerate the issue,\" and that some restrictions will be lifted this week, allowing \"low-risk businesses\" to return to work. ##Health## Queen\u00a0Elizabeth\u00a0II offered reassurance to the British public and called for unity on Sunday in a rare televised speech. \"Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,\" the\u00a0Queen said. \"\u00a0I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.\" The address comes as UK authorities warn people to stay at home, and as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to the hospital for tests, after days of coronavirus symptoms. Johnson tested positive for the virus on March 27. It's extremely rare for the Queen to address the nation like this: She typically only speaks to the country during an annual televised Christmas message and when a new parliament is installed.  She's only held these types of emergency national addresses a handful of times in history -- one time during World War Two, which she alluded to during her speech on Sunday. \"It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister. We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety,\" the\u00a0Queen\u00a0said, adding\u00a0\"today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0Queen, 93,\u00a0concluded by again calling for unity saying, \"we will succeed.\" ##Daily Life## ##Health## Singapore has reported 120 new cases of coronavirus in 24 hours -- its biggest daily jump of reported infections since the coronavirus outbreak began -- the country's Ministry of Health said in a statement.

Fifty cases were linked to existing clusters, while contact tracing is ongoing for the remaining 66, the statement said. Dormitories locked down: On Sunday, Singapore said that\u00a0it has locked down two foreign worker dormitories as the number of reported cases continued to rise, according to another notice posted by the Ministry of Health.\u00a0 The dormitories, the\u00a0S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, have been declared isolation areas. Foreign workers are\u00a0banned from moving between blocks or reporting to work for 14 days, but will continue to receive their salary during this period. The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, has 13,000 resident workers, while Westlite Toh Guan has\u00a06,800. ##Health## ##Daily Life## When Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide\u00a0lockdown\u00a0on March 25, Indian Railways took the unprecedented move of suspending passenger trains across the country until April 14. It was the first time in 167 years that Asia's oldest rail network had been suspended. Now the railway network has decided to convert as many as 20,000 old train carriages into isolation wards for patients as the virus spreads. The network, which is the world's fourth-largest rail operator and India's biggest employer, already operates 125 hospitals across the nation, so has the expertise to expand into mobile beds. While India's hospital system isn't overwhelmed yet, the repurposed trains could ease some of the pressure if the number of coronavirus patients begin to rise. For more on how India is turning train carriages into turn into hospitals, read here:   There was a heated disagreement in the Situation Room this weekend over the efficacy of the\u00a0malaria drug hydroxychloroquine -- but multiple sources say it was mostly one-sided. President Donald Trump's top trade adviser Peter Navarro feuded with other officials inside the coronavirus task force over the unproven drug's treatment for the virus.\u00a0 Medical experts have repeatedly explained to the President that there is a risk in touting the drug in case ultimately it doesn't work. But other aides and outside advisers have sided with Trump, including Navarro, who is still not a formal part of the task force but has wedged himself into the meetings. What happened: While discussing the latest on\u00a0hydroxychloroquine this weekend, Navarro lashed out at Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert and one of those advisers who has urged caution about the drug, a person familiar with the meeting told CNN.\u00a0 Not data: Navarro had brought a stack of paperwork with him into the Situation Room on the drug, arguing it was proof that it could work to treat coronavirus, which Fauci disagreed with because it was not data.\u00a0 Not a proven treatment: A source close to the task force said Fauci is not backing off of his belief that hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment for coronavirus. When CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond asked Fauci to comment on the matter Sunday night, Trump stepped in and didn\u2019t allow Fauci to answer. But a source said the doctor has already offered his opinion on the drug in other venues and would continue to do so. The argument highlights how deep the divide runs over the task force's response to the coronavirus outbreak: Another source told CNN that despite the disagreement in the Situation Room with Fauci and Navarro, Fauci continues to have a good relationship with Trump and Vice Presdient Mike Pence, though some staffers have shown irritation when his opinions differ.\u00a0 Read more here: ##Health## ##Business## ##Daily Life## United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres said there has been a \"horrifying global surge in domestic violence\" and urged governments to make women\u2019s safety a key part of their national coronavirus response plans.

Meanwhile healthcare providers and police are overwhelmed and understaffed. Local support groups are paralyzed\u00a0or short of funds. Some domestic violence shelters are closed; others are full.\u00a0 Watch his address here:  Akila Radhakrishnan, president of the Global Justice Center, said the call \"recognizes how violence and crisis situations exacerbate existing inequalities in society and emphasize the need to center those most impacted in responses.\" \"However, to date, we have consistently seen that Covid-19 responses have inadequately taken women\u2019s rights and human rights into account. And there\u2019s been a lack of inclusivity in the groups responsible for crisis response and decision-making,\" she said. ##Health## ##Daily Life## New York City is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, with emergency frontline workers saying they are facing \"battlefield conditions.\" \u201cWe\u2019re now in a major triage mode.\u00a0Battlefield conditions,\" said\u00a0Michael Greco, Vice President of the\u00a0FDNY\u00a0EMS union. \"We're in wartime mode.\" The city now has a total of 64,955 cases and 2,472 deaths, according to the government site.  Hopeful signs: After a few weeks of social distancing and business shutdowns, the number of deaths has begun dropping \"for the first time,\" said Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday -- but he cautioned that it's too early to tell whether this means New York has passed the peak. In the meantime, China is stepping in to help. The Chinese government has facilitated a donation\u00a0of 1,000 ventilators that were scheduled to arrive at JFK Airport on Sunday, Cuomo said. \"This is a big deal and\u00a0it's going to make a significant\u00a0difference for us,\" he said. ##Health## There are at least\u00a0337,274\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the United States, according to\u00a0Johns Hopkins University's tally.

Mahler stressed the importance of maintaining social distance at all times, especially with Easter and Passover coming soon.  One of the residents who died was a \"healthy person\" who had hugged and cried with a friend, after they visited and said her husband was in the final stages of terminal cancer. The friend was \u201ca very healthy person who was home avoiding contact with the public,\u201d Mahler wrote. \u201cLess than a week later the friend became ill.

A number of these patients have since recovered and been discharged from hospital. China, once the country with most cases, is now sixth on the list, with 82,602 cases. The past two weeks have seen a striking reversal of roles, with the US and Europe seeing explosive growth in cases while the number of new daily infections dropped dramatically in China, according to government-reported figures. Daily death tolls are now beginning to slow in Italy, Spain, and France, as the US continues to grapple with an exponential rise in cases. ##Health## China's National Health Commission reported 39 new cases of coronavirus across the country on Sunday.

The restrictions will apply even to people not showing symptoms and also would require 14-day quarantines for cruise passengers and crew. CNN reported on the restrictions being finalized earlier Sunday. An administration official said these new protocols would likely be agreements between cruise ship companies and the government, requiring that they be followed in order for these ships to dock at specific ports. Exceptions: The official said that there could be a range of exceptions and specific circumstances that would divert from the new protocols, specifically as it relates to foreigners on the ships. Limit onward travel: These new restrictions will limit cruise passengers and crew to flying on charter aircraft or using private transportation. How many ships could be affected? The US Coast Guard said Saturday\u00a0there are 114 cruise ships, carrying 93,000 crew members, either in or near US ports and waters. This includes 73 cruise ships, with 52,000 crew members, moored or anchored in US ports and anchorages.

Vessels are required to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard, to have their passengers offloaded, the release said. Passengers and crew who have received medical screenings and clearance for travel are driven on charter buses to an isolated area of Miami International Airport and go directly to board charter flights coordinated by the cruise line, the release said. Gimenez sent additional medical staff to assist the Coral Princess Sunday, the release said. The county also replaced the ship's oxygen cylinders with full ones after learning the supply on board was critically low, the release said. ##Travel## Hydroxychloroquine will be used in a trial\u00a0of 3,000 patients at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, and the results will be tracked in a formal study, Vice President Mike Pence announced Sunday.
