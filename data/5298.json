Outdoor meeting places used for recreation in Nevada will be closed until further notice in order to curb the spread of Covid-19, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday. The order includes public gyms, swimming pools and golf courses.\u00a0Sisolak said people can continue to play sports on their own private property. Additionally, as most Christian denominations begin to celebrate the Easter week, Sisolak is prohibiting public worship services, except those that can be done with no more than 10 people.\u00a0 \u201cThis wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d Gov. Sisolak said in a Wednesday news conference. \u201cIn these trying times, I have clung to my faith to guide me.\u201d The new Nevada orders also close retail showrooms for businesses like car dealerships and furniture stores.\u00a0 Sisolak said these areas \u201cencourage customers to wander around and touch products, and that sort of shopping experience can lead to a higher likelihood of spreading the disease.\u201d Although grocery stores can continue to operate as essential businesses, they can no longer sell food on open display, such as salad bars, bulk candy and freshly-ground coffee. ##Daily Life## Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the state was \"trending in the right direction\" at a news conference on Wednesday. Overall, Louisiana had 746 new cases on Wednesday, bringing the state's total to 17,030. There were 70 new deaths reported. Edwards noted that there are currently\u00a01,983\u00a0hospitalized patients who have tested positive, down from yesterday, which was at 1,996.  \"So overall the hospitalization number is up, but the rate of growth in hospitalizations is in line with us being on a lower trajectory for case growth than where we were last week,\" Edwards said.\u00a0\n\"The number of new hospitalizations suggest that we're trending in the right direction, but thus far the number of deaths is higher than we want it to be to have corroboration of that. And so the two most essential data points are not in agreement. Overall we think we probably are hitting in a better direction with a lower trajectory and that we're starting to flatten the curve, but we can't be sure yet.\" Louisiana testing center closes temporarily: The Alario Center coronavirus testing site announced that it would close today, due to a lack of test kits, the Jefferson Parish said on Wednesday. \u201cA new supply shipment, which was expected to arrive today, is now delayed,\u201d the parish announced via Twitter, before mentioning that it is anticipating a reopening on Friday. ##Health## ##Daily Life## More than 400 coronavirus cases are linked to one jail in Chicago, local officials said, making the Cook County Jail the largest known source of infections in the US outside of medical facilities. The Cook County Sheriff\u2019s office said Wednesday that 251 detainees and 150 staff members have tested positive for the virus. Of the detainees infected in the outbreak, 22 are hospitalized for treatment and 31 others have been moved to a recovery facility. One detainee has died of \u201capparent\u201d complications of Covid-19, sheriff\u2019s officials said, but an autopsy remains pending.  The jail has created a quarantine \u201cbootcamp\u201d to keep detainees that are infected separate from the rest of the\u00a0jail\u00a0population.\u00a0 The\u00a0jail\u00a0complex currently houses about 4,700 detainees according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\u00a0Jail\u00a0officials have previously said they planned to screen and release nonviolent pretrial defendants. ##Health## Peyton Manning, on behalf of the Manning family, donated 140 meals from Drago\u2019s Seafood Restaurant to feed health care workers at Tulane Health System in New Orleans on Wednesday. \u201cI wanted to take a minute to say thank you to the entire team at Tulane Health System,\u201d Manning said in a video message to Tulane Health System employees. \u201cAs healthcare workers on the front lines, you are demonstrating great courage and commitment, and making great personal sacrifices to care for the sick during this national crisis. I know I speak for Louisiana and the entire nation when I say how grateful I am for each and every one of you. Thank you. Be well. Stay strong and keep up the great work.\u201d\u00a0 New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu expressed his frustration with obtaining crucial medical supplies from the federal government during a press conference in Concord on Wednesday. The state received 15 Abbott rapid-testing devices last week, as part of the Granite State\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Sununu.  However, the Republican governor said they received only a limited number of the cartridges required to perform the tests, and a portion of those must be used for training and calibration purposes.  Sununu hoped to stock two machines with cartridges and get them into the field \u201cfairly quickly,\u201d but when the state requested additional cartridges for the remaining 13 machines, he was told to expect approximately 15% of his requested cartridges.  \u201cWhy would you send out 13 machines to a state and not give them any ability to use it? Like none,\u201d Sununu said Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s literally nothing you can do with this machine if you don't have the proprietary stuff from CDC and FEMA.\u201d Sununu also said he doesn\u2019t know when to expect that portion of cartridges.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating because there's a lot of talk about this device, there was a lot of hype on it nationally, how it was it wonderful, and when they showed up, expectations were set really high, as they should be,\u201d the governor said. \u201cBut to actually have 13 of these devices and have no way to use them. I'm banging my head against the wall. I really am. It\u2019s really frustrating.\u201d Ahead of Passover and Easter, the Department of Homeland Security warned the faith-based community about an \"increase\u00a0in online hate speech intended to encourage violence\" or use the ongoing coronavirus pandemic situation as an excuse to spread hatred. In a letter to community members Wednesday, the department reminded\u00a0houses of worship to review security plans and procedures ahead of congregant gatherings,\u00a0acknowledging\u00a0that many people are\u00a0worshipping\u00a0remotely at this time.\u00a0 \"[T]here has been an increase in online hate speech intended to encourage violence or use the ongoing situation as an excuse to spread hatred,\" read the letter from the department's\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, obtained by CNN.\u00a0 Additionally, stressors caused by the pandemic may contribute to an individual\u2019s decision to commit an attack or influence their target of choice, according to DHS. The letter is aimed at providing the faith community with guidance for planning of \"restoration of normal operations, whenever that may be.\" Some context: Officials at DHS have been grappling with how to address concerns about targeted violence amid the ongoing health crisis. The department is trying to balance resources needed to respond to Covid-19 across the country and the need to remind people to be vigilant of potential violence, a DHS official said.\u00a0 Social distancing\u00a0creates opportunity to become\u00a0isolated, more glued to the TV and computer and less social engagement, said the official, adding \"no doubt we are all experiencing stress.\" Officials are concerned that\u00a0someone\u00a0who is\u00a0already\u00a0vulnerable\u00a0could\u00a0easily be recruited by\u00a0violent\u00a0ideologies\u00a0or that the situation becomes precursor\u00a0to them carrying out attack. In addition, the department is aware of individuals using Covid-19 to\u00a0propagate\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0theories, said the official.\u00a0 A prestigious scientific panel told the White House on Tuesday that it doesn't look coronavirus will go away once the weather warms up.\u00a0 President Donald Trump has claimed that \"when it gets a little warmer [the virus] miraculously goes away.\"\u00a0 In their letter to the White House, members of a National Academy of Sciences committee said data is mixed on whether coronavirus spreads as easily in warm weather as it does in cold weather, but that it might not matter much given that so few people in the world are immune to coronavirus.\u00a0 \"There is some evidence to suggest that [coronavirus] may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity; however, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions,\" the letter stated. The letter noted, for example, that a study of the outbreak in China showed that even under maximum temperature and humidity conditions, the virus spread \"exponentially,\" with every infected person spreading it to nearly two other people on average.\u00a0\u00a0 The scientists sent the letter to Kelvin Droegemeier at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The letter from the NAS scientists notes that some laboratory studies have shown reduced transmission of the virus under warmer and more humid conditions, but that it's still a concern. The letter points out that in the real world, the virus is still transmitting in countries with warm weather.\u00a0 \"Given that countries currently in 'summer' climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,\" the letter said. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr.\u00a0Robert Redfield issued new guidelines for essential workers who have been exposed to the\u00a0coronavirus, saying individuals would need to be asymptomatic to return to work The guidelines, he said, are aimed at keeping essential workers including first responders, health care workers, employees in the food supply chain and others at work -- even if they might have been exposed to someone who has coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cThese are individuals that have\u00a0been within six feet of a\u00a0confirmed case or a suspected\u00a0case so that they can, under\u00a0certain circumstances, they can\u00a0go back to work if they are\u00a0asymptomatic,\u201d\u00a0Redfield said.\u00a0 Redfield said those individuals could return to work if they take their temperature before work, wear a face mask at all times and practice social distancing at work.\u00a0 He reiterated\u00a0that individuals should stay home if they feel sick, they should not share items\u00a0used on or near\u00a0their face and they should refrain from congregating in break rooms and other crowded places. The CDC\u2019s new guidelines also outlined steps employers should take,\u00a0including\u00a0checking temperatures before employees start work, sending anyone who becomes sick home and cleaning commonly touched surfaces more frequently, among others. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that it was not the time for a leadership change at the World Health Organization, but did not dispute President Donald Trump\u2019s earlier call to potentially scale back funding for the organization. \u201cThis is not the time to be doing that kind of change,\u201d Pompeo said at the White House briefing. \u201cThere will be a lot of time to look back and see how the World Health Organization performed.\" \u201cIn the meantime what our task is is to preserve and protect the American taxpayers to make sure that our resources don\u2019t go to places that aren\u2019t going to deliver on behalf of the American people and the world,\u201d Pompeo continued. \u201cAnd President Trump and I are determined to do that.\u201d Some context: In a Wednesday interview with \u201cThe Wendy Bell Show,\u201d Pompeo said that \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear that the World Health Organization hasn\u2019t lived up to its billing, it hasn\u2019t been able to achieve what it was designed to achieve, and we just can\u2019t continue to permit that to go on.\u201d \u201cIt performs important functions, important global health and pandemic functions, and we can see in this case we haven\u2019t been able to deliver on that,\u201d he said on the radio show. \u201cSo we need a global health organization that can achieve that and if this one can\u2019t do it, then it\u2019s not appropriate for American taxpayer dollars to go towards it.\u201d Despite Pompeo\u2019s suggestion that the US is not looking to replace WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus for the time being, a senior administration official on Wednesday said that WHO\u2019s leadership was part of their problem. \u201cThe problem is not the WHO system. The system has good people\u2026 It\u2019s about comments made from the leadership\u2014which went beyond what I am told their own staff wanted to say,\u201d the official said. \u00a0 \u00a0 Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci pushed back on conspiracy theories suggesting that coronavirus deaths in the US are being inflated, especially among those dying with existing underlying conditions. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it very clear, every time I\u2019ve been up here, about the comorbidities,\u201d Birx said Wednesday during the White House press briefing. \u201cThis has been known from the beginning. So those individuals will have an underlying condition but that underlying condition did not cause their acute death when it\u2019s related to a Covid infection.\u201d \u201cHaving an underlying condition and getting this virus, we know, is particularly damaging to those individuals,\u201d Birx added. Fauci took things a step further, saying, \u201cYou will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises. They are nothing but distractions.\u201d \u201cI would just hope that we just put those conspiracy stuff \u2014 and let somebody write a book about it later on, but not now,\u201d he continued. Dr. Deborah Birx,\u00a0the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said models projecting the number of American deaths from coronavirus have dropped dramatically in recent days because Americans have drastically changed their behavior.\u00a0 Birx said the US was doing \"much better in many cases than several other countries, and we're trying to understand that.\"\u00a0 \"We believe that our health care delivery system in the United States is quite extraordinary,\" she said, but added that the models were based on \"what America is doing.\"\u00a0 \"I think what has been so remarkable I think to those of us that have been in the science field for so long,\" Birx continued, \"is how important behavioral change is, and how amazing Americans are at adapting to and following through on these behavioral changes.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, later said the changing models proved that social distancing steps are working.\u00a0 \"We know that mitigation does work. The reason that we know it works, is the question that was asked about the numbers...why they came down with the projections,\" Fauci said.\u00a0\"What you do with data will always outstrip a model. You redo your models depending upon your data.\" \"Our data is telling us that mitigation is working,\" Fauci said. \"Keep your foot on the accelerator, because that is what's going to get us through this.\" Some context: As CNN previously reported, an influential model tracking the coronavirus pandemic in the United States now predicts that fewer people will die and fewer hospital beds will be needed compared to its estimates from last week. As of Wednesday, the model predicted the virus will kill 60,000 people in the United States over the next four months. That's about 33,000 fewer deaths than the model estimated last Thursday. While the US is still expected to face a shortage of about 16,000 hospital beds, it will need 168,000 fewer beds than previously expected, according to the new analysis. Vice President Mike Pence said he was briefed Wednesday that Philadelphia is \u201can area of particular concern\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cAn area of particular concern we\u00a0were briefed on this morning is the city of\u00a0Philadelphia.\u00a0I spoke today to (Pennsylvania) Gov. Tom Wolf and as we\u00a0begin to see early trend lines in\u00a0Philadelphia, I assured him that\u00a0we were going to continue to flow\u00a0resources and support to that\u00a0community,\u201d Pence said at the daily White House briefing on the outbreak.\u00a0 Pence emphasized that people in Philadelphia need to practice social distancing \u201cnow more than ever.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOur message to\u00a0the people of the Philadelphia\u00a0area is now more than ever,\u00a0practice the social distancing\u00a0so that Philadelphia, and to some\u00a0extent even Pittsburgh, do not\u00a0have to endure what other\u00a0communities before them have had\u00a0to endure,\u201d Pence said. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, added that\u00a0the Philadelphia metropolitan area is seeing 1,400\u00a0cases per day and the Baltimore/Washington, DC, area is seeing a 15% positivity rate with 500 cases per day in DC and 200 cases per day in Baltimore.\u00a0 Companies will soon be blocked from exporting critical medical supplies needed by the US for the coronavirus response, unless the Federal Emergency Management Agency gives approval for overseas shipments, according to a federal draft regulation. The combined effort between FEMA and US Customs and Border Protection, which oversees trade and travel, comes as the United States seeks to shore up equipment for hospitals treating coronavirus patients. Late last week: White House trade adviser Peter Navarro previewed these actions, saying there is \u201ca black market which you have described, where we're having people bid against each other, brokers come in, they're bidding and bidding on all this different (personal protective equipment).\" \"It's driving the price up and guess what? You know where it's going? The domestic sources here are being exported,\" said Navarro, the White House's Defense Production Act policy coordinator, at last Thursday's White House briefing. \"We are going to crack down unmercifully.\" In a joint statement Wednesday, the two agencies, both of which fall under the Department of Homeland Security, said they're \"working together to prevent domestic brokers, distributors, and other intermediaries from diverting these critical medical resources overseas.\" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards urged people to keep social-distancing for the Easter holiday.\u00a0 \"This Easter is not going to look\u00a0like\u00a0previous Easters, but it doesn't mean that you can't find some\u00a0significant\u00a0way to\u00a0meaningfully worship and to celebrate,\" Edwards, a Democrat, said. \"There was no\u00a0Easter exemption from the stay-at-home\u00a0order. There was no Easter exemption from the 10 person\u00a0limit. Because that virus isn't going to honor that.\" \"The virus is very\u00a0much in control and that's why we're\u00a0trying to do things that will actually\u00a0limit the impact of the virus,\" Edwards said. President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed his attacks on the World Health Organization after the head of the organization asked him not to\u00a0\u201cpoliticize the virus.\u201d\u00a0 At a press conference earlier Wednesday, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded to attacks from Trump about how his organization handled the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 \u201cPlease don\u2019t politicize this virus... If you don\u2019t want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it. My short message is: Please quarantine politicizing Covid,\" Ghebreyesus said. At Wednesday's White House briefing, Trump declared it was Ghebreyesus who was politicizing the coronavirus and said he believes the organization favors China. \u201cI\u00a0can't believe he's talking about\u00a0politics when you look at the\u00a0relationship they have to China.\u00a0So China spends $42 million, we\u00a0spent $450 million and everything\u00a0seems to be China's way.\u00a0That's not right, it\u2019s not\u00a0fair to us and honestly it's not\u00a0fair to the world,\u201d Trump said. Trump implied that there would have been fewer coronavirus deaths if the WHO gave a \u201ccorrect analysis.\u201d \u201cI think when you say more body bags, I think we would have done, and he would have been much better serving the people that he\u2019s supposed to serve if they gave a correct analysis,\u201d Trump said. Watch: The city of Miami said Wednesday it has mandated all employees and customers in grocery stores, restaurants, pharmacies and convenience stores to wear masks at all times while on premises, effective today at 11:59 pm ET. In a statement, the city said this \u201ccitywide order to wear masks extends to those performing construction work on job sites, as well as food delivery workers.\u201d ##Daily Life## The novel coronavirus has infected more than 1.5 million people and killed more than 87,000 worldwide, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. There are at least\u00a0424,945\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US\u00a0and at least\u00a014,529\u00a0people have died from the disease in the country. New York City has 5,603 new coronavirus cases and 716 new deaths,\u00a0according to the city website. The city now has a total of 80,204 coronavirus cases and 4,260 deaths. President Donald Trump says it will be safe to reopen the country when \"we can say we have to be on that down side of that slope.\" \"We can do it in phases, go to some areas where \u2014 you know, some areas are much less affected than others,\" he said at a Wednesday coronavirus task force briefing. \"But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country, or certainly most of our country.\" CNN reported earlier Wednesday that discussions are underway at the task force level about how to reopen the US economy.  Trump said he believes the US is \"ahead of schedule\" in efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus. \"You hate to say it too loudly because all of a sudden things don't happen. But I think we will be sooner rather than later,\" Trump said. \"But we'll be sitting down with the professionals. We'll be sitting down with many different people making a determination,\" he went on. \"And those meetings will start taking place fairly soon.\" Watch: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says a \"handful\" of State Department officials around the world have tested positive for Covid-19, but the vast majority of US facilities are open.\u00a0 Pompeo said that only one US embassy has closed due to coronavirus. \"Our embassies, save for the one that is in Wuhan which we did pull everybody out of, the rest of our facilities around the world are all open,\" Pompeo said during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on Wednesday.\u00a0\"We\u2019ve had a handful of our folks test positive, but we feel like we have a good handle on it, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure that not just the State Department officials, but our Department of Defense colleagues that are working on these missions as well are doing so in a way that reduces risk to them and their well being.\" He later added that three local hires, \"not US direct hires, but local people who were working for the State Department in embassies around the world,\" have died of coronavirus.\u00a0 When asked Wednesday if China has withheld information on the coronavirus, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that now is \u201cnot the time for retribution\u201d and instead stressed transparency of data from China and other countries. China, he added, has been cooperating in many areas that the US is \u201cdeeply appreciative\u201d of, but he did not get into additional details.  Pompeo refrained from bashing China during the Wednesday White House briefing, changing his tune from earlier in the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis is not the time for retribution but it is still the time for clarity and transparency,\u201d Pompeo said. \"Every country, China included, needs to share data.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday\u00a0announced\u00a0a second major purchase of ventilators, buying more than 43,000 ventilators from the manufacturer Philips for $646.7 million. The ventilators will go into the national stockpile, which gets distributed across the country, in chunks. Philips will make a first delivery by the end of May of 2,500 ventilators, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. The company will deliver a total of 43,000 ventilators by the end of the year. The major purchase comes hours after the department announced a similar contract for the auto company General Motors to make ventilators. The contract with Philips, a company that was already a major presence in building ventilators, comes under the Trump administration's announcement to use the Defense Production Act to get more needed supplies to aid the fight against the coronavirus epidemic. HHS said it will award five other companies contracts under the DPA. \"The DPA is allowing the federal government to work with manufacturers, such as Philips, to accelerate production of ventilators and ensure that they go where they\u2019re needed most,\" Secretary Alexander Azar said in a statement Wednesday. \"HHS will continue awarding contracts to companies for which it has invoked the DPA for ventilator production, while we explore every possible avenue to get life-saving supplies to the frontlines of this war on the virus.\" Frans van Houten, CEO of Royal Philips, issued a statement, saying Philips is\u00a0\"actively collaborating with the U.S. government to help save lives in the U.S. and across the globe.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThere is an unprecedented global demand for medical equipment to help diagnose and treat patients with COVID-19,\" van Houten said. \"We welcome the support of the U.S. government in our efforts to aggressively increase the production of hospital ventilators. We believe in fair allocation of scarce medical equipment to those who need it the most, and we are ramping up to deliver 43,000 units to the most critical regions in the U.S. in the coming weeks and months through December 2020.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the State Department has repatriated over 50,000 citizens from around the globe since January 29\u00a0amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cSince January 29 we have now\u00a0repatriated over 50,000\u00a0United States citizens back to\u00a0their homes.\u00a0From more than 90 countries, more\u00a0than 490 flights back to the\u00a0United States from all across\u00a0the world, this world wide scale\u00a0of our repatriation efforts is\u00a0without parallel in our\u00a0lifetime,\u201d Pompeo said. Pompeo said the State Department is working with \u201cforeign\u00a0governments, militaries, airport\u00a0authorities, medical units,\u00a0transportation companies, hotels, you name it \u201d to make sure Americans get back to their families. Pompeo said that there are still US citizens in places across the world, and that the State Department will continue to work on getting people back to the United States until people can travel on their own again.\u00a0 \u201cWe still have several thousand\u00a0people that we\u2019re working, they\u00a0identify themselves every day and\u00a0new people find themselves in\u00a0difficult place.\u00a0Look, we\u2019re gonna be done when people can\u00a0travel on their own again,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe are gonna keep it up as long as we\u00a0have resources to do it and\u00a0there is a need.\u201d ##Travel## Only 21.6% of hotel rooms in the United States were occupied last week, according to new data from hospitality analytics company STR.\u00a0 That\u2019s down slightly from the week before and down more than 68% from the same week last year.\u00a0\u00a0 Only 7% of the rooms in Oahu Island, Hawaii, are occupied, the lowest rate for any market in the country and down more than 90% from the same week last year.\u00a0 Across the board, economy hotels and lodging in suburban areas tended to have more people staying than other hotels, according to STR.\u00a0 New York City posted about 18% occupancy last week, which was a slight increase from the just over 15% posted for two weeks ago.\u00a0 ##Business## African Americans in Mississippi account for 56% of coronavirus cases and 72% of deaths, state epidemiologist\u00a0Dr. Paul Byers said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing some significant disparities, some racial disparities both in the percentage of cases we\u2019re seeing and deaths,\" he said. \"We\u2019re seeing now 56% of our reported cases so far are in African Americans.\" He added: \"72% of the deaths we\u2019ve reported are in African Americans and when you break down those deaths, when you look at them, we\u2019re seeing significant incidents of diseases like diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, those chronic underlying problems that we know exist in Mississippi already.\" Illinois' Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike on Wednesday announced the state is reporting 1,529 new Covid-19 cases, including 82 deaths, over the last 24 hours.\u00a0 \"These are our highest numbers to date,\" Ezike said in a press conference. \"Although the numbers are still increasing, I will tell you that the rate at which they are increasing is less, and that is a good sign. We are not seeing the exponential growth that we were seeing before,\" she added. Illinois has a total of 15,078 coronavirus cases, with 462 deaths in the state.\u00a0 A New York City hospital had issues with its oxygen supply Tuesday night causing the urgent transfer of multiple patients to be cared for elsewhere,\u00a0Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughessy told CNN.\u00a0 \u201cThey needed to transfer those patients immediately as quick as possible because their lives were dependent on it,\u201d said O\u2019Shaugnessy, the commander of US Northern Command overseeing the military response. A team of 37 military doctors, nurses and technicians in full personal protective equipment moved 18 patients in an ambulance to different facilities for urgent care.\u00a0 Ten patients were moved to the USNS Comfort, five to Sinai, two to Bellevue and one to North Bronx, the general said.\u00a0 O\u2019Shaughessy said the military is there to be used in such an emergency at area hospitals. \u201cIt was challenging, they were all in various significant states of acute medical needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they got to (the) Comfort, several of them were crashing so they had to provide that immediate medical assistance ... As they were pulling up to the Comfort they were crashing so the doctors from the Comfort had to respond in the ambulance and then get them stabilized and then bring them into the Comfort.\u201d A source with knowledge of the operations at multiple hospitals said the New York City area hospital had \u201cmajor problems with excess ice accumulation on their overburdened medical oxygen systems.\u201d  According to Johns Hopkins University's tally, there are at least\u00a0423,135\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a0at least\u00a014,390\u00a0people have died from the disease. So far on Wednesday, Johns Hopkins has reported\u00a024,326\u00a0cases and\u00a01,495\u00a0reported deaths in the US. The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0Wyoming is the only state or territory that is not reporting a death from coronavirus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with NPR Wednesday that the chamber would not have unanimous support to approve the Senate\u2019s version of a measure to add $251 billion in funding to a small business loans program established by the $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package last month. \u201cThe bill that they put forth will not get unanimous support in the House. It just won\u2019t,\u201d Pelosi said of the Senate\u2019s straightforward bill to add more funds to the small business Paycheck Protection Program. Democrats have called for additional funding for hospitals, state and local governments, and food stamps to be passed alongside the small business loans funding.\u00a0 \u201cThe White House says they don\u2019t support that, but we do,\u201d Pelosi said. Asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s removal of the inspector general who had been tasked to oversee the implementation of the CARES Act, Pelosi said what Trump is doing \u201cis so very, very wrong.\u201d \u201cWe cannot allow this to happen without a bright light shining on it,\u201d she said of rolling out the aid package.  Pelosi said the committee on the coronavirus crisis that Democrats plan to launch later this month will seek to prevent waste, fraud, abuse, profiteering and price-gouging.\u00a0 \u201cThis is not an offense to the President. It's about how big money attracts some kind of profiteering and price gouging and the rest,\u201d she added of the committee\u2019s purpose. The nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert\u00a0told a reporter that the handshake, a customary American greeting, could become a thing of the past as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States. Asked about the country getting back to normal, Dr. Anthony Fauci told Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s political reporter Scott Thuman that \u201cit depends on what you mean by 'normal.' \u201d \u201cI think what we\u2019re going to have embedded and imprinted in us forever is the realization that something as catastrophic as what the world is experiencing now can happen,\" Fauci said. \u201cAnd just as a society, just forget about shaking hands. We don\u2019t need to shake hands. We\u2019ve got to break that custom because, as a matter of fact, that is really one of the major ways that you can transmit a respiratory-borne illness.\u201d\u00a0 The US Food and Drug Administration has sent a letter to a firm marketing a product that falsely claims to \u201ccure, mitigate, treat, prevent, or diagnose Coronavirus and/or Covid-19 in people,\u201d according to a press release from the agency. The letter was sent to Genesis II Church of Health and Healing and multiple websites associated with the firm. It targeted the \u201cMiracle Mineral Solution\u201d -- a chlorine dioxide product -- which was marketed as prevention and treatment for coronavirus. The FDA has issued previous warnings that chlorine dioxide poses a significant risk to health and is not shown to be safe and effective for any health use. \u201cThe sale of these products can jeopardize a person\u2019s health and delay proper medical treatment,\u201d FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen\u00a0Hahn said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to take action and keep up our efforts to monitor for fraudulent treatments during this public health emergency and remind the public to seek medical help from their health care providers.\u201d The recipient of the warning letter has 48 hours to provide documentation that misleading claims have been corrected, along with outlining what steps are being taken to prevent future recurrences. Failure to do so \u201cmay result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction,\u201d according to the letter sent Wednesday.\u00a0 CNN has reached out to\u00a0Genesis II Church of Health and Healing for comment. ##Health## Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has extended the state's\u00a0public health emergency through May 13. Kemp signed an executive order Wednesday extending the public health emergency in an effort to help contain the coronavirus. \u201cThis measure will allow us to deploy more resources to communities in\u00a0need, lend support to frontline medical providers\u00a0and keep preparing as we brace for potential patients in healthcare facilities,\u201d the Republican governor said. Kemp also announced Wednesday the state will extend the shelter-in-place order through April 30 in accordance with public health recommendations. Kemp added he has signed an executive order\u00a0to activate an additional 1,000 national guard members to assist in the novel coronavirus emergency response.\u00a0 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz held a news conference today extending the state\u2019s stay-at-home order and public accommodation order to May 4. The governor said they plan to use the time to expand testing, and went on to say that \u201cwe have flattened the curve more than any other state.\u201d When asked about schools, the governor said, \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely students will go back to school on May 4, but I won\u2019t close the door on that.\u201d  Walz said school is \u201clikely done for the year.\u201d Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said there were 85 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, raising the number to 1,154. There were also five new deaths, for a total of 39. Department of Employment and Economic Development Commissioner Steve Grove said there was good news on the unemployment insurance front.  Grove said he believes Minnesota is the first, or among the first states, to process the $600 from the Federal Cares Act. The recipients could see that money as early as later this week, Grove added. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced Wednesday that schools will continue to be closed statewide for the rest of the academic year.\u00a0 Brown, a Democrat, says all high school seniors who were \u201con track to graduate\u201d before schools were closed will receive passing grades.\u00a0 \u201cI refuse to punish students \u2026 because they could not attend classes for a little over two months,\u201d Brown said in a press conference. South Carolina\u00a0Gov. Henry McMaster signed an executive order Wednesday which allows furloughed employees to receive \u201cCovid-19 Support Payments\u201d from their employers and still qualify for unemployment benefits, his office said. \u201cEvery day, our primary objective is to protect South Carolinians, but we also must act to protect the state\u2019s economy,\u201d said McMaster. \u201cThis order does both. It allows our businesses to take care of their employees as best as they can and will help our economy recover from this unprecedented time.\" South Carolina has 2,417 confirmed coronavirus cases and 51 deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.  Rhode Island Gov. Gina M. Raimondo announced that the courts extended their closure for all non-essential business through May 17. She also asked the people of Rhode Island to wear a cloth mask every time they leave their house.\u00a0 The governor explained today that eviction is a court procedure, saying, \"you cannot be evicted anytime for any reason between now and May 17 because the court is closed.\" The governor also spoke about people who are struggling to pay their full mortgage, saying, \"we are working on ways to provide relief around that, and I hope to have an announcement in the next few day or next week to help you get some forgiveness. Because I know it is impossible to pay your mortgage if you and your family are out of work.\"\u00a0 ##Daily Life## As confidence grows that the state may be nearing its peak of new coronavirus cases, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Wednesday they are giving back a military field hospital that was intended to deal with a surge of patients.\u00a0 The hospital \u2013 set up at an event center adjacent to the CenturyLink Field sports stadium in Seattle \u2013 will be available to FEMA to be redeployed to another state. \"We requested this resource before our physical distancing strategies were fully implemented and we had considerable concerns that our hospitals would be overloaded with Covid-19 cases,\u201d Inslee said in a statement.\u00a0 The decision to return it was made with the approval of the leaders of the Seattle and King County governments.\u00a0Inslee said the state still has the ability to increase its hospital capacity by 1,000 beds quickly in case of a surge, even without the military hospital. The decision comes three days after Inslee returned more than 400 ventilators the state received from the Strategic National Stockpile back to the federal government.\u00a0At the time, Inslee said Washington had a sufficient supply of ventilators on its own, while states like New York faced a bigger immediate need. ##Health## 170 Detroit police officers that have tested positive for coronavirus, Mayor Mike Dugan said today.\u00a0 Denise Fair, Chief Public Health Officer for the City of Detroit, said Detroit has 5834 confirmed cases and 240 confirmed deaths.

A total of 566 people have died of Covid-19 complications in Nassau County, according to the state Department of Health. Earlier Wednesday at a briefing, Curran said the county\u2019s supply of ventilators is not as much of an issue as its need for protective equipment like masks and gowns. She said there have been more ventilators freed up as patients recover or pass away. \u201cUnfortunately, the majority of people who are on ventilators for an extended period of time do not make it. So it is a combination of those who\u2019ve passed away and those who\u2019ve gotten better,\u201d Curran said today. Data provided to CNN by Curran\u2019s office shows health care workers are using 935,000 gowns per week. As of last night, the county\u2019s stockpile had 1,200 gowns available to share with healthcare workers. \u201cWe have a shortage of gowns and we need more right now,\u201d Curran said in a statement to CNN. ##Health## California will utilize new technology from the company Battelle that allows for the sterilization and reuse of N95 masks as early as this week, Mark Ghilarducci, with the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, announced today. \u201cIt's a technology that is designed to get on the ground, and actually bring in a used N95 mask and do a sterilization and cleaning process that makes them basically new again,\u201d Ghilarducci told reporters Wednesday. \u201cAnd this is new technology that has that has been certified by the FDA, and CDC, and it will be here in California, here within the next week. As capability, we\u2019ll have the ability to clean up to 80,000 masks per day.\u201d CNN's Julia Chatterley interviewed Battelle\u2019s CEO, Lewis Von Thaer, Wednesday morning, who said that using hydrogen peroxide in vaporized form, \u201cwe proved that we could reuse these masks, basically decontaminate them for reuse up to 20 times with no degradation.\u201d \u201cI'm very happy to report we're up and operating in Ohio today,\u201d Von Thaer told CNN. \u201cJust going online in Seattle and Stonybrook, Long Island, and we'll soon be online in Boston in the next few days\u2026 our goal is to set up regional systems and multiple hospitals come into that region because we can clean so many masks at one time.\u201d ##Health## There are at least\u00a0419,975\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally.

Airbus said the reduced schedule was designed \"to adapt to the new coronavirus market environment.\" The company delivered only 122 of the 182 planes it built during the quarter because of \"customer requests to defer deliveries,\" it said. It will now build about 40 of the A320 each month, down from 60 per month of its best-selling single-aisle jet. The A330 will produce two a month from nine, and the A350 production has been scaled back to six a month from between nine and 10. Airbus has temporarily halted production at numerous plants in Europe and North America due to health concerns. The reduced production schedule will be in place when the plants resume work. Rival Boeing, which reports its deliveries and orders next week, also has temporarily stopped building commercial jets as well. More than half the 22,000 planes in the global commercial airline fleet have been grounded in the crisis, according to tracking firm Cirium, and that number is climbing as airlines slash their schedules, or cancel all flights in some cases, due to a combination of travel restrictions and passengers' health concerns. ##Business## Massachusetts reported 1,365 new cases of Covid-19, Gov. Charlie Baker said on Wednesday, bringing the state\u2019s total to 15,202. At least 81,344 tests have been conducted so far in Massachusetts, Baker said, and the state continues to see a rise in the percent of people testing positive.  On Monday, about 30% of all tests conducted were positive and on Tuesday that number was similar at 28%.\u00a0 The state expects to see the peak in cases occur sometime between April 10\u00a0and April 20, Gov. Baker said. ##Health## Arkansas recorded its lowest positivity rate for coronavirus in a 24-hour period to date on Tuesday,\u00a0Dr. Nathaniel Smith, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health, said Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cYesterday, we received results from 1,436 test and we had a 1.6% positivity rate so this is the greatest number of test results we've received in a 24-hour period to date,\u201d Smith told reporters in Little Rock.

Approximately 51% of hospital beds, 40% of ICU beds, and 70% of the state\u2019s ventilators, are available at this time, according to Levine. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf also announced that the state will be launching a hospital preparedness dashboard, that will let anyone see a county-by-county breakdown of key equipment availability and usage. Delta said it will no longer book the middle seat on flights through the end of May in an effort to allow for social distancing. Delta said it is also pausing automatic, advance seat upgrades. \"These will now be processed at the\u00a0gate\u00a0\u2013 still in priority order \u2013 to allow gate agents to determine how to best seat customers\u202fwhile considering\u202fsocial distancing and aircraft weight-and-balance restrictions,\" said the airline. Some context: Delta and other airlines have already been slashing schedules and reporting a\u00a0low level of passenger traffic\u00a0on flights.  For example, Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Delta employees that it would be reducing its schedule by 80% in April due to the lack of demand, that it expects second quarter\u00a0revenue to be down 90%\u00a0and that on March 28, it carried only 38,000 customers, versus its normal late-March Saturday traffic of 600,000. ##Travel## ##Business## There are at least\u00a0404,352\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

More than 700 ventilators have yet to be used according to Gimenez.\u00a0 DeSantis reminded Floridians to keep social distancing rules when applying for unemployment and commended the City of Hialeah for instituting a drive-thru following\u00a0yesterday's long lines. ##Health## Mayor Lori Lightfoot has announced a 9 p.m. curfew on liquor sales in Chicago effective Thursday. Lightfoot said at a press conference today that the curfew was prompted by the fact that \"too many individuals and business were violating the stay at home order\" at the press conference that was provided to CNN by affiliate WGN. \"Far too many have been congregating at stores that sell alcohol, especially in the evening hours,\" Lightfoot said. The new order gives city police the power to \"further curb non-compliance\" through fines, arrests, and the revocation of liquor licenses, Lightfoot announced. The city has already issued \"significant citations\" to eight businesses for violations of existing orders, Lightfoot said. Interim Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department Charles Beck said that the city's officers have dispersed over 2,000 groups since the start of the city's public health orders. \"Last night was our zenith, our highest level of dispersals, at over 300,\" Beck said at the press conference. \"We've done enforcement, we've done warnings, we've\u00a0written tickets, and we've made arrests, now its time to limit opportunities,\" Beck explained. ##Daily Life## ##Business## President Trump approved a disaster declaration for Vermont due to Covid-19.  This is the 52nd disaster declaration approved by the President in response to the coronavirus pandemic: 47 states, the US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico have all declared disasters.\u00a0 Only Alaska, Idaho and Wyoming have not declared disasters. The US has never had a 50-state disaster. In a call with reporters Wednesday, local and county officials with the National Association of Counties raised the alarm that the federal response to Covid-19 has left counties in the lurch and without resources. Much of the challenges they\u2019re facing involve meeting budgets and hitting revenue targets, which have been sorely hit by states closing businesses nationwide. Cook County, Illinois, Board President Toni Preckwinkle was among the county officials who was on the call. Preckwinkle said they have \u201cfaced some tremendous challenges around personal protective equipment ... there's been, I can only say, an inadequate and chaotic federal response to this.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOur purchasing folks in our Office of Emergency Management have been scouring the marketplace to try to find, particularly the N95 masks that we need, but, personal protective equipment more broadly,\" she said. \"I think that's been one of the most kind of the biggest challenges for local units of government in the fact that we haven't had a comprehensive and coherent effort at the federal level to stockpile and distribute this equipment.\u201d Mark Poloncarz, who serves as the county executive for Erie County, New York, echoed that sentiment. \u201cWe've had a number of orders that we processed with reputable partners to get N95 masks and the like, almost all of these are made overseas, and of course, there have been delays. We've heard the stories about where vendors are processing an order and then your order comes back a few days later and you've been told you're not getting it anymore, primarily because they're selling it to someone else. So, we are all kind of in the same boat with regards to this across the country,\" Poloncarz said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a social media campaign to encourage New Yorkers to stop the spread of coronavirus. He announced the campaign \u2014 using the hashtag #IStayHomeFor \u2014 after his daily news conference. \u201cWho are you staying home for? It's not about staying home for yourself. Stay home for others, stay home for the vulnerable people \u2026 stay home for the health care worker in the emergency room because you don't want to infect anybody else who puts a greater load on the health care system. Who are you staying home for? I'm staying home for my mother,\u201d he said during a press briefing Wednesday. Read Cuomo's tweet: \u00a0 Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers today that the White House coronavirus task force is working on establishing a framework for how Americans will be able to return to normalcy, according to a source. Fauci held a call today with Democratic House members. On it, he was asked about antibody testing and tracking that the White House task force has been working on in terms of developing a timeframe toward normalcy. Fauci told lawmakers that the White House task force was working on it last night.  But remember: This is an ongoing conversation.\u00a0 Another source said that Vice President Mike Pence was very complimentary on the call of governors \u2014 including Democrats \u2014 for helping to slow the spread of the disease. Pence cited local and state leaders in Washington and California as having made a significant contribution in helping to slow the spread. ##Daily Life## There are 7,026 hospitalizations in New Jersey which include Covid-19 positive patients and persons under investigation for coronavirus, according to Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli.

Johns Hopkins has been collecting data directly from state and local health officials since the first case appeared in the United States in late January.\u00a0 ##Health##\u00a0 Data suggests that coronavirus infection rates are higher for black and Hispanic residents of New York, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\u00a0 In New York City, 34% of deaths from coronavirus are Hispanic while 28% of deaths are black. Respectively, those numbers are 14% and 18% for the rest of the state.  The figures are disproportionate as compared to each population in the state.\u00a0Cuomo said that the state is going to immediately start more testing in minority communities.\u00a0 Cuomo referenced how minority communities are affected in natural disasters, such as in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.\u00a0 \u201cWhy is it that the poorest\u00a0people always pay the highest\u00a0price?\u00a0But let's figure it out.\u00a0Let's do the work.\u00a0Let's do the research.\u00a0Let's learn from this moment and\u00a0let's learn these lessons and\u00a0let's do it now,\u201d he said. \"Let's actually get research and\u00a0data that can inform us.\u201d New Jersey has seen 3,088 new positive tests for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, Gov.

There have been 275 deaths reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the statewide total to 1,504. New York. Gov Andrew Cuomo said all voters in the state will be able to cast their votes by absentee ballot this year. Cuomo had previously moved the state's primary from April 28 until June 23. \"I've seen lines of people on television voting in other states. This is totally nonsensical,\" Cuomo said. \"All New Yorkers can vote absentee on June 23.\" Some background: Wisconsin held its primary as scheduled yesterday despite the pandemic. Long lines of voters, many of them wearing face masks, stretched for blocks through Milwaukee. Republicans had insisted on keeping the election on schedule, winning two legal battles Monday, as the state Supreme Court blocked Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' bid to delay it until June. Watch: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will make an additional $600 payment to all who filed for unemployment during the coronavirus crisis. \"The federal government says they\u00a0will reimburse us for it, but\u00a0people need money now in their\u00a0pocket.\u00a0So, New York will be doing that\u00a0immediately,\" he said. Watch: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pointed out that the death toll in the state so far during the coronavirus crisis has far eclipsed the number of people killed during the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Cuomo said that the 2,753 New Yorkers were killed at the World\u00a0Trade Center, while 6,268 have died so far in the coronavirus pandemic. Watch: New York Gov.

Watch: World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed President Trump\u2019s claims that WHO mishandled the coronavirus, saying right now, \u201cthe focus should be on fighting this virus.\u201d\u00a0 \"Not only that we said we have been doing everything we can, but we will continue to do everything \u2014 day and night like we have been doing to save lives. We don\u2019t want to waste time,\" Tedros said Tedros said, when you\u2019re confronted with a new and dangerous serious public health concern like coronavirus, WHO does an after-action assessment, \u201cso we will do our assessment identifying the strengths and weaknesses,\u201d WHO wants to learn from our mistakes and strength and move forward, Tedros said. Some background: During the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing yesterday, President Trump said WHO had mishandled the coronavirus. \u201cWe'll be looking into that very carefully. And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're going to see,\u201d he said.

Chuck Schumer, according to GOP sources. McConnell has checked with senators to determine whether any of them will object to moving just the $251 billion package.\u00a0 Democrats are expected to object to passing the $251 billion package if their demands aren't met. Those requests include hundred of billions of dollars for hospitals and state and local governments, according to Democratic sources. That means we could see on the floor tomorrow morning dueling efforts by both sides to pass their bills \u2014 with both expected to fail, according to a source involved in the talks. Talks are expected to occur today to see if any deal could be reached to avoid a stalemate. There are\u00a0401,166\u00a0coronavirus cases in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

There are 70 additional deaths in Pennsylvania, bringing the statewide total to 310, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. There are also 1,680 new cases, which the state says brings its total to 16,239. \u201cNow more than ever, as we continue to see Covid-19 cases and deaths rise in Pennsylvania, we need Pennsylvanians to take action,\u201d Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said.  She continued: \u201cThose actions should be to stay calm, stay home and stay safe. If you must go out, please limit it to as few trips as possible and wear a mask to protect not only yourself, but other people as well. We need all Pennsylvanians to heed these efforts to protect our vulnerable Pennsylvanians, and our healthcare workers and frontline responders.\u201d ##Health## Canada\u2019s national lockdown will continue \u201cfor many more weeks\u201d as the nation studies how best to resume some economic activity, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday.  He added that things \"won\u2019t be back to normal.\" \"The current measures will be in place for many more weeks so we have time to get that right and to look what other countries that might be earlier in their phase do that is successful,\u201d he said. Trudeau said his government is looking at different scenarios, but it's still too early to think about relaxing any social distancing measures. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very, very, important to do it in a measured, graduated way that allows for economic activity to begin while preventing severe spikes in COVID transmissions.\u201d By the numbers: Canada has reported 17,984 cases of Covid-19 and 391 related deaths. Per capita, Canada has less than half the reported coronavirus cases than in the United States and a lower death rate.

JetBlue appears to be the first US airline to use new rules finalized yesterday that allow airlines operating at multiple airports in the same city to cut back on flights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rules: The Department of Transportation rules allow airlines serving multiple airports in the same geographical area to consolidate service at a single airport.\u00a0That allows airlines to cut back on duplicative ground operations \u2014 such as customer service agents and restocking planes \u2014 while remaining eligible for federal stimulus funds.\u00a0To receive the funds, an airline must continue to provide at least one flight each week to the areas they currently serve.\u00a0\u00a0 JetBlue will use that approach in five of its markets: In Washington, DC, JetBlue will suspend operations at the Baltimore-Washington, and operate flights only from Reagan National.\u00a0\nIn the New York City, JetBlue will use two New York-area airports \u2013 Newark and JFK \u2013 and suspend operations at LaGuardia, Westchester County and Stewart.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the Boston area, the airline will continue operations at Logan International and suspend operations at Providence's T.

Fauci added, \u201cDriving that and ahead of that is that fact that we are going to start to see the beginning of a turnaround, so we need to keep pushing on the mitigation strategies, because there is no doubt that\u2019s having a positive impact on the dynamics of the outbreak.\u201d \u201cAs we get further on, beyond this week, we should start to see a turnaround which is a good sign,\u201d he added.\u00a0 ##Health## The Dow rose 330 points at the open after giving up all of a 900-point rally yesterday.

As\u00a0we've said previously, we will not take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about Covid-19.

Murphy said the $2 trillion CARES Act is a start for the unemployed, but the state needs cash to allay the effects of the pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cGod knows, we need the Feds to come in in a big way,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to need another\u00a0big slug of money to make sure\u00a0we can stay above water and\u00a0continue to serve the folks who\u00a0need us most.\u201d\u00a0 Murphy said the state doesn\u2019t have enough beds and equipment right now, but is sourcing supplies from around the world and has opened a 500-bed field hospital.

World trade is expected to fall by between 13% and 32% in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic disrupts normal economic activity and life around the world, the World Trade Organization said in its annual trade report and outlook.  WTO economists believe the decline will likely exceed the trade slump brought on by the global financial crisis of 2008.\u00a0 Trade volume had already dropped by 0.1% in 2019 as a result of tariffs and a slowing economic growth.\u00a0 The organization said that nearly all regions will suffer double-digit declines in trade volumes in 2020, with exports from North America and Asia hit hardest, warning that trade will likely fall steeper in sectors with complex value chains, particularly electronics and automotive products. WTO added trade volume could recover in 2021 but uncertainty remains as it will depend largely on the duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the policy responses. \"The unavoidable declines in trade and output will have painful consequences for households and businesses, on top of the human suffering caused by the disease itself. These numbers are ugly \u2013 there is no getting around that. But a rapid, vigorous rebound is possible. Decisions taken now will determine the future shape of the recovery and global growth prospects,\u201d WTO Director-General Roberto Azev\u00eado said as he urged countries to work together. ##Business## \u00a0 Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said officials are looking at areas in the United States where mitigation efforts seem to be working to determine if the social distancing guidelines currently in place could be relaxed at the end of April. \"We're doing a series of clear investigations of what happened in Washington and L.A. and what does that mean and how you keep the number of cases down,\" Birx said today during an appearance on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\u201d Birx also said officials expect to roll out an antibody test in the next 10 to 14 days \"so we can really tell how many Americans were asymptomatic and infected.\"\u00a0 \"This makes a big difference in really understanding who can go back to work and how they can go back to work, so all of those pieces need to come together over the next couple of weeks,\" Birx told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## A 27-year-old Maryland grocery store clerk with cerebral palsy died of the coronavirus in her mother\u2019s arms.\u00a0 \u201cI was able to hold\u00a0my baby's hands for the last\u00a0time \u2026 It was my baby.

Africa's first Covid-19 case was reported in Egypt in February and the novel coronavirus has spread since then. However the number of cases has grown \"exponentially\" in recent weeks, according to WHO officials. \"COVID-19 has the potential not only to cause thousands of deaths, but to also unleash economic and social devastation. Its spread beyond major cities means the opening of a new front in our fight against this virus,\" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa, in a written statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This requires a decentralised response, which is tailored to the local context,\" Moeti said. \"Communities need to be empowered, and provincial and district levels of government need to ensure they have the resources and expertise to respond to outbreaks locally.\" The statement noted that WHO has been working with governments across Africa to \"scale up\" their response capacities when it comes to coordination, surveillance, testing, isolation, case management, contact tracing, infection prevention and control, risk communication and community engagement during the coronavirus pandemic. ##Health## Tesla is telling staff to brace for pay cuts and furloughs as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupts operations and cripples demand.\u00a0 Starting next Monday, US employees at the electric car company who hold director and vice president-level roles and above will see pay reductions of 20% to 30%, and \"everyone else\" will receive a pay cut of 10%, according to an internal email obtained by CNN Business.\u00a0 The reductions are expected to be in place until the end of June.

Tesla is running \"minimum critical operations\" at the moment, and expects to resume full operations at US plants in early May \"barring any significant changes,\" the email said.\u00a0 But until then, the company needs to manage costs, and implement what it calls \"a shared sacrifice ... during these challenging times.\"\u00a0 Tesla did not respond to a request for comment outside of working hours. Employees who can't work from home and haven't been assigned to critical work on site will be furloughed, and the majority of furloughed staff will receive unemployment benefits \"roughly equivalent to take home pay,\" the email said.\u00a0 The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted major automakers' operations around the world. Volkswagen, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and others have had to close plants or suspend operations across Europe and Asia.\u00a0 Tesla recently opened a factory in Shanghai, where production of its Model 3 car was delayed earlier this year because of the outbreak.\u00a0 In the United States, the current epicenter of the pandemic, car sales have plummeted as millions across the country have been told to stay at home except for essentials such as shopping for food, drugs or seeking medical care. Other major corporations, including automakers like Ford, have also announced executive pay cuts to mitigate the consequences of the outbreak. ##Business## US futures lost ground Wednesday as economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic continues to mount. Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite futures were all down by just under 0.2%, and US stocks were slightly lower after declines Tuesday on Wall Street.

But cats should not be forced to stay inside if it causes them stress, it added. There have been a \u201ctiny\u201d number of Covid-19 cases in animals but it appears the transmission was human to animal, said the association in a statement.  \u201cThere is no evidence that pets can pass Covid-19 to their owners,\u201d it added. So far, dogs have not shown any symptoms but cats have displayed \u201cclinical signs of the disease.\u201d\u00a0 The association warns that the virus can sit on pet fur in the same way as on other surfaces. Handwashing is the best line of defense, it advises.\u00a0 \u201cAs a precaution, for pet owners who have Covid-19,or who are self-isolating, we are recommending that you keep your cat inside during that time, if possible,\u201d it said. ##Health## Spain has recorded its second consecutive daily increase in the number of deaths from coronavirus following a week-long decline, according to data from the Health Ministry released Wednesday.\u00a0 Figures show 757 people died in the past 24 hours, an increase from 743 deaths recorded the previous day. However it was only a 5.5% in relation to the total number of deaths, a slight slowdown compared to Tuesday\u2019s 5.7% rise on the total. According to the Health Ministry 14,555 people have now died from the novel coronavirus in Spain. The number of active cases has also gone up from 83,504 to 84,111, an increase of 610, which is the lowest in nearly a month.

The Health Ministry also reported 48,021 people have now recovered from the virus, 4,813 more than the number reported Tuesday. Spanish officials did not report the number of patients in intensive care (ICU), the first time this has been left out since reporting began. This is because the Health Ministry wants all of Spain's 17 regions to report the accumulated cases of such patients, but it says that five regions have been reporting only the current number of patients in ICU rather than the accumulated number.  The Ministry said it would report the ICU figures again once all regions are reporting them the same way. ##Health## French President Emmanuel Macron will address the nation Thursday regarding the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The country has now seen more than 10,000 coronavirus-related deaths and has moved to tighten local confinement measures.

Doctors have successfully treated 77,279 patients who have now recovered and been discharged from hospitals. This Monday was the first time China saw no daily increase in coronavirus-related deaths since the NHC began releasing daily updates in late January. ##Health## The coronavirus outbreak is one of \u201cnature\u2019s responses\u201d to human beings ignoring the ecological crisis, said Pope Francis Wednesday. \u201cWe did not respond to the partial catastrophes. Who now speaks of the fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted? Who speaks now of the floods?\" the Pope told British Catholic journalist Austen Ivereigh in an email interview published Wednesday in The Tablet and Commonwealth magazines. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these are the revenge of nature, but they are certainly nature\u2019s responses.\u201d Pope Francis also said he is recovering from his bronchitis and praying even more from his residence in the Vatican during this \"time of great uncertainty.\" Francis revealed he goes to confession every Tuesday to ask forgiveness for his own selfishness.\u00a0\u201cI take care of things there,\u201d he said. Francis said the homeless should be quarantined in hotels and not in parking lots. \u201cA photo appeared the other day of a parking lot in Las Vegas where they [the homeless] had been put in quarantine. And the hotels were empty. But the homeless cannot go to a hotel,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cThis is the moment to see the poor,\u201d he said, whom society often treats as \"rescued animals.\" The Pope warned against the rise of populist politicians, who he said are giving speeches reminiscent of Hitler in 1933, and others who are focusing solely on the economy. \u201cI am worried by the hypocrisy of certain political personalities who speak of facing up to the crisis, of the problem of hunger in the world, but who in the meantime manufacture weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cToday I believe we have to slow down our rate of production and consumption and to learn to understand and contemplate the natural world.\" The Pope encouraged people at home on lockdown to find creative ways of being at home. \u201cTake care of yourselves for a future that will come,\u201d Francis said. ##Health## The German economy will shrink by 4.2% this year, according to Timo Wollmershaeuser, a senior economist at IFO Center for Macroeconomics and Surveys. Economies around the world are bracing for major damage due to the coronavirus outbreak, and data coming out of China, where the virus was first detected, has revealed how the economy was devastated in the first two months of the year. The collapse in activity\u00a0affected every sector of the world's second-biggest economy, as\u00a0the epidemic\u00a0and\u00a0draconian measures\u00a0designed to contain it delivered an unprecedented shock that is now being replicated around the world. ##Business## The Eurogroup, an informal meeting point for Eurozone finance ministers, has suspended talks on an aid package for countries affected by the coronavirus, according to a tweet from group president Mario Centeno. Talks lasted 16 hours and will continue Thursday, said Centeno, who added \"we came close to a deal but we are not there yet.\" The plans are designed to defend the Eurozone and the European Union, and would come in addition to measures implemented by national governments. \"We have to be as comprehensive as possible for the different sectors of our economy,\" said Centeno in an interview with German outlet Sueddeutsche Zeitung, outlining plans for a safety net of around half a trillion euros. ##Business## London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the United Kingdom is still some way off being able to ease the restrictions introduced to stop the spread of coronavirus. \"We\u2019re nowhere near lifting the lockdown,\" Khan told BBC Radio on Wednesday.\n\"I speak to experts regularly. We think the peak\u00a0-- which is the worst part of the virus -- is still probably a week-and-a-half away.\" Khan said there is still spare capacity in the city\u2019s intensive care units, but added that \"too many people are losing their lives.\" Junior health minister agrees: Edward Argar told BBC Radio that the restrictions will be reviewed \"when the scientific advice is such that we appear to have gone over the peak and when it is safe to do so.\" \"Now is the time to hold firm to what we\u2019ve been telling people to do -- to stick to the guidance, stick to the regulations -- and not put at risk all the progress we have made.\" He also urged people to stay home over the Easter weekend. The lockdown restrictions were introduced by the UK government nearly three weeks ago. They were initially due to be reviewed on Monday. There are at least 55,949 confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK, including 6,171 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.  ##Daily Life## The chaos and confusion rocking President\u00a0Donald Trump's\u00a0administration on the most tragic day yet of the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic\u00a0was exceptional even by his own standards. Trump set out Tuesday to cement his image of a wartime leader facing down an \"invisible enemy\" at a dark moment as the country waits for the virus to peak and with the economy languishing in suspended animation. \"What we have is a plague, and we're seeing light at the end of the tunnel,\" the President said, on a day when\u00a0a record number of Americans\u00a0succumbed to the wicked respiratory disease. But instead of putting minds at rest, Trump's wild performance put on display many of the personal and political habits that have defined his tumultuous presidency. It was a troubling spectacle coming at such a wrenching chapter of national life, the kind of moment when presidents are called to provide consistent, level leadership. What went down: To begin with, Trump sparked concern that he will prevent oversight of the disbursement of economic rescue funds by removing a\u00a0watchdog official responsible for overseeing the $2 trillion package. The move, coming after Trump ousted an intelligence community inspector general last week, was yet another sign that an already impeached President is using the cover of the worst domestic crisis since World War II to further erode constraints on his power. Then Trump insisted he hadn't seen January memos by a\u00a0top White House official\u00a0warning about the pandemic at the same time the President was dismissing it as a threat. He also announced he was placing a \"very powerful hold\" on funding for the\u00a0World Health Organization, even though it correctly identified the scale of the virus and he didn't. Then moments later, he insisted he did no such thing.

In the KCNA report, vice director of the institute Ri Jae Dok said that \"the newly-developed mask fully confirms (sic) with the technological specifications of masks recognized by the World Health Organization.\u201d The masks are reportedly treated with a nano-antibiotic solution that helps sterilize and remove germs and viruses, and filters fine dust, according to the report. The masks are being produced at the Pyongyang Medical Appliances Factory, according to KCNA. ##Health## Residents of the southern state of Bavaria in Germany are being asked to stay at home over Easter to contain the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cPlease stay at home over the Easter holidays as well,\u201d Bavaria\u2019s State Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer said in a statement.

The bulletin -- from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and National Counterterrorism Center -- cites threats from an array of hate groups aimed at minorities. It also predicts that\u00a0spaces like hospitals and grocery stores could be potential targets -- as well as police officers enforcing\u00a0stay-at-home orders. The background: The four-page document, which was obtained by CNN, is the latest in a string of warnings from the national security apparatus about the threat from extremist groups as the coronavirus has exploded across the country and upended facets of daily life. Law enforcement have already responded to two extremist plots in recent days, including a train engineer in California who allegedly derailed his train nearby a naval hospital ship that he thought was being used in a government takeover, and a Missouri man who was accused of attempting to detonate a car bomb at a hospital treating coronavirus patients, the bulletin says. Reports of attacks against Asian people have also intensified in the US after the outbreak began in China. Extremist groups: In the bulletin, the agencies write that some extremist groups have blamed China for the spread of the virus, concluding that hate crimes against Asians will likely increase over the next two to three months. Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews and Israel are responsible for the manufacturing and spread of the virus have also proliferated in some hate group circles, the bulletin notes, heightening the risk of violence against Jews in the country.

What the authorities are doing: The department said it will implement a mandatory 14-day modified plan to minimize the spread of the virus, including physical distancing during inmates\u2019 daily routines, and proper disinfecting. Last week, California state corrections officials announced up to 3,500 inmates will be released early to prevent the spread\u00a0of\u00a0coronavirus in state prisons. The state of California currently has more than 17,500 coronavirus cases, including at least 450 deaths. ##Health## Those working legally in Japan's sex industry will be able to access assistance in the government\u2019s economic relief package, Health and Labor Minister Kazunobu Kato said in a news conference Tuesday. That's a reversal of the government's original plan, which excluded restaurants and bars in the adult entertainment industry. The government will provide a subsidy of 8,330 yen ($76) per day to businesses that allow employees to take leave to care for children out of school. The government's original plan was criticized as occupational discrimination by government opposition members. ##Daily Life## If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Global cases pass 1.4 million: At least 1,431,375 coronavirus cases and 82,145 deaths have been recorded worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. This total doesn't reflect the number of active cases, but rather the number of all infections since the outbreak began.\nUS infections near 400,000: At least 399,886 cases have been recorded in the US, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The country's death toll stands at 12,907.

His spokesperson said Tuesday that he was receiving the \"standard oxygen treatment.\" Singapore has banned all social gatherings as part of its latest restrictions to help combat Covid-19, according to a news release on the health ministry\u2019s website.\u00a0 This includes both public and private gatherings. The rule, which applies to families and friends not living together, was passed by Parliament on Tuesday and imposed from Wednesday. The rule is part of a \u201cCircuit Breaker\u201d plan in the country\u2019s fight against the virus and will be imposed until at least May 4. Singapore has reported at least 1,481 coronavirus cases and six deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. ##Daily Life##  ##Travel## After more than two months under lockdown, people in Wuhan can finally travel out of the city. Today marks the official re-opening of outbound travel -- inbound restrictions had already been eased. Trains and flights are resuming, except to and from the capital Beijing. Outbound travel demand is likely to come from out-of-towners who have been stuck in Wuhan during lockdown, and the limited number of people traveling for business. But to travel, people will still need to flash their all-important QR code on their phone. If it's green, they've been assessed as healthy or low-risk, and they can leave the city.  Trains: Wuhan\u2019s railway authority was quoted by state media Tuesday saying that they are expecting\u00a055,000 passengers\u00a0to leave Wuhan by train on Wednesday. Most travelers are bound for the Pearl River Delta region in southern China, a major manufacturing hub, according to pre-sale ticket figures. Railway authorities said they will maintain strict screening, disinfection and other health measures throughout stations and trains. Flights: At least 54 flights were listed out of Wuhan Wednesday, according to local media Time Weekly. The capacity of these flights is reported to be around 10,000 passengers leaving Wuhan to 15 different destinations. ##Health##  ##Daily Life## Editor's note: Dr. Terence Kealey is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and a professor of clinical biochemistry at the University of Buckingham in the UK, where he served as vice chancellor until 2014. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. South Korea, the US and the UK all reported their first Covid-19 cases around the same time: on\u00a0January 20,\u00a0January 21, and\u00a0January 31, respectively. How things unfolded from there, unfortunately for the US and UK, has been strikingly different.\u00a0 Today, South Korea is reporting fewer than 100 new cases a day, the UK is reporting around 4,000 new cases a day, and the US is reporting around 30,000. But while numbers in South Korea have fallen, in the US and UK they\u00a0have been rising exponentially\u00a0 Nonetheless, the great success story is South Korea, and we know how they did it: they tested. The timeline of the virus: On December 31, 2019,\u00a0Chinese officials informed\u00a0the World Health Organization they had identified an unknown pneumonia, and on January 10, with impressive speed, Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University, Shanghai,\u00a0published the virus's RNA sequence -- which can be used as the basis of a diagnostic test. How South Korea responded: By February 4, Kogene Biotech of Seoul had not only developed a test kit but had also\u00a0had it approved\u00a0by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And by February 10, was\u00a0reporting its findings\u00a0on the first 2,776 people to have been tested. At that point, there were only 27 confirmed cases in South Korea, so -- in another impressive demonstration of speed -- the South Korean authorities tested each of them and, more importantly, isolated those who tested positive and monitored their contacts. How the US responded: In the US and many other countries, however, a lack of testing kits prohibited the identification and isolation of individuals, so whole populations and whole economies have had to close down instead. By comparison, South Korea has been spared that fate partly by the government's response and partly by the swift reaction of its biotech industry.

Chan School of Public Health. \"We found that an increase of only 1 gram per cubic meter in fine particulate matter in the air was associated with a 15% increase in the Covid-19 death rate,\" said lead author Francesca Dominici, co-director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative.\u00a0 The study defined high pollution levels as fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) levels above 13 micrograms per cubic meter of air, much higher than the US mean of 8.4.\u00a0 \"The results suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution increases vulnerability to experiencing the most severe Covid-19 outcomes,\" Dominici said. While the study was focussed on the US, it could have implications for other countries, too. India, for instance has 21 of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution. American Lung Association President and CEO Harold Wimmer said that the study's findings illustrate that \"far too many Americans are facing multiple threats to their lung health at once, and when taken together, these different threats to lung health impacts can amplify each other.\" \"We cannot afford to delay cleanup of dangerous air pollution,\" he said. \"In fact, it is more important than ever.\" Read the full story here: ##Health## The Navy hospital ship docked at a New York City pier is preparing to take in more critical patients overnight, according to its medical commanding officer. \u201cWe have, I believe, around 10 ICU-level vented patients headed our way \u2026 from one of the local hospitals,\" Captain Patrick Amersbach of the United States Naval Ship (USNS) Comfort told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon late Tuesday night. Amersbach did not say whether those patients have coronavirus infections. The Comfort originally was only going to accept non-Covid-19 patients, but that restriction was rescinded Monday night.\u00a0 A crew member who has not been in contact with patients tested positive for Covid-19, but this will not affect the ability for the Comfort to receive patients, Amersbach said. As a precaution, he says, the medical treatment areas of the Comfort are being isolated from the rest of the ship, and some crew members will be lodging in local hotel rooms instead of staying aboard throughout the day.

Those numbers follow two consecutive days where the number of cases dropped below 50. The national death toll is now 200.  So far, South Korea has tested over 450,000 people. ##Health## As the United States hit another record for most deaths from coronavirus in a single day, President Donald Trump said the country was \"way under\" any coronavirus models. \u201cWe\u2019re way under any of the polls or any of the models as they call them,\u201d Trump said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox Tuesday\u00a0night. \u201cWe are way under, and we hope to keep it that way, in terms of death.\u201d The US has recorded at least 398,809 coronavirus cases, including 12,895 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Some 30,613\u00a0new cases and\u00a01,909\u00a0deaths were reported on Tuesday. The President, who seemed to be taking what could turn out to be a premature victory lap, said that New York \u201cis getting ready, if not already, getting ready to peak.\u201d Trump also said that he would love to start the economy back up \u201cwith a big bang,\u201d opening the entire country to business all at once. But he said the administration is also considering opening up in sections.  \u201cI think we really have a chance to open big and catch where we were,\u201d Trump said, going on to tout the economy\u2019s success before the virus hit.\u00a0 Ventilators and hospital beds: President Trump also said his administration was right about its estimates for hospital beds and ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients. \u201cI think we\u2019re reaching a level where it\u2019s going to start coming down, where it\u2019s going to start sloping down. The good thing is that the number of beds needed -- I think we were right about that. I was right. My group was right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re not needing nearly as many beds as they thought. They\u2019re not needing as many ventilators as they thought.\n\u201cEveryone is in great shape from the standpoint of ventilators.\u201d Over the\u00a0weekend, the President cautioned that there could be a shortage of ventilators available to Americans. \u201cI mean, it could be you have shortages, and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need,\" Trump said at the time.\u00a0 On Tuesday morning, Surgeon General Jerome Adams appeared on the NBC Today show warning that the federal stockpiles of medical supplies are inadequate for dealing with this type of epidemic alone. ##Health## In China, authorities are using technology to track who is likely to be healthy -- and who poses a risk. Residents are each assigned a color-coded QR code on their phones -- and that color correlates to what they're able to do. In Wuhan, even now the lockdown is lifted, residents still need to produce a green QR code to leave their compounds. For those returning to work, they also need to produce a letter from their employer. To get into places such as restaurants, people need to show that QR code -- and only people with a green code will gain entry. But if your code is yellow or red, it means you've been flagged for some reason. If, for instance, you had been on a plane with a person infected with coronavirus, you would be flagged and your code might change color. Those with a yellow or red code might be asked to self-isolate -- or even have to go into state quarantine. The whole thing relies on big data, and means local governments have a database of people's travel history, their health history, and whether they've been in close contact with anyone who has coronavirus.  There's another potential problem -- different provinces have their own health QR codes, and sometimes they have issues recognizing codes from another region.  Watch how the codes work here: ##Daily Life## A record high of more than 800 fatalities were reported in just one day on Tuesday in New York City, according to city health officials. The national daily total of 1,909\u00a0new deaths was also a record high, according to Johns Hopkins University. It is unclear whether the New York City figure was used in compiling the US total. Still, the distressing numbers came as some officials expressed hope that some areas of the country were reaching the peak of the curves of cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Earlier, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had said the numbers of hospitalizations in his state was reaching a plateau but residents still needed to be disciplined. \"We have to be smart. We have to be safe. ... We do that by staying at home,\" he told reporters. US coronavirus cases are nearing 400,000 and the death toll has reached at least 12,895. However, health officials say parts of the country\u00a0that leaned in heavily to social distancing measures\u00a0may be\u00a0seeing a slowdown in the growth of cases.

But while easing of restrictions in the city where the pandemic began can be seen as a positive sign, Chinese health experts have also urged the public to continue to practice caution. Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run Health Times on Thursday that the epidemic in China was far from over. \"China is not near the end, but has entered a new stage. With the global epidemic raging,\u00a0China has not reached the end,\" he said. With global infections continuing to surge, a growing number of cases have been imported to China -- many of them Chinese students and workers eager to return home. As of Tuesday, 698 imported coronavirus cases have been reported by Chinese authorities. Concerns grow over asymptomatic carriers: In China, only patients showing symptoms and positive results in nucleic tests are included in the official tally of confirmed cases. Asymptomatic patients who have tested positive are monitored and placed under quarantine until they develop symptoms or turn negative in later tests. Amid mounting public concerns, China started to announce a separate daily number of asymptomatic carriers last week. Since then, dozens of new asymptomatic carriers have been found in Wuhan every day, with 673 currently under medical observation. \"Although for now, it seems that the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are relatively low, they are still infectious and we should be vigilant,\" Yang Jiong, a respiratory expert at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told the Health Times on Monday.

The Phase 1 trial is estimated to be completed by late summer of 2020, a spokesperson for Inovio told CNN in an email. It will enroll up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia and Kansas City, Missouri, according to a news release.  The Phase 1 trial is meant to establish that the vaccine is safe and induces a desired response from participants' immune systems. Proving that the vaccine is effective in preventing Covid-19 infection requires follow-up studies involving many more participants, which will take many more months. \u201cWe anticipate rapid enrolment of this initial study,\u201d Dr Pablo Tebas, an infectious disease specialist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the study\u2019s principal investigator, said in the news release. \u201cThere has been tremendous interest in this vaccine among people who want to do what they can do to help protect the greater public from this pandemic as soon as possible.\u201d Similar to Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine, which began Phase 1 testing\u00a0in March, Inovio\u2019s vaccine is also derived from genetic material. However, Inovio\u2019s vaccine -- named INO-4800 -- is derived from DNA, not messenger RNA, which makes up Moderna\u2019s vaccine. Inovio received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. \u201cIn ten weeks from funding, INOVIO manufactured thousands of doses of INO-4800 to support on-going Phase 1 and planned Phase 2 clinical trials,\u201d the news release said. ##Health##\u00a0 The US Food and Drug Administration will take \u201cappropriate action against firms making false claims or marketing\u201d coronavirus tests, according to a news release from FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn.\u00a0 As of Tuesday, only one Emergency Use Authorization has been issued by the FDA for a serological test for coronavirus. The test is intended only for clinical laboratory use. A serology test would be able to identify past coronavirus infections, although it may be less effective at identifying recent ones. More than 70 test developers have notified the agency that they have serological tests available for use, according to Hahn\u2019s statement. \"However, some firms are falsely claiming that their serological tests are FDA approved or authorized, or falsely claiming that they can diagnose COVID-19.\" In March, the FDA issued a new policy which allows companies to market serological tests for coronavirus without FDA review so long as they met certain conditions. The new policy was an effort to identify individuals who have overcome an infection and have developed an immune response to coronavirus, according to Hahn. ##Health## New Zealand reported 50 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday -- the third consecutive day that the country has reported a decline in new cases compared with the day before. The country's director-general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, announced the new cases at a news conference on Wednesday. They include 26 confirmed cases and 24 probable cases. New Zealand is half way through a month-long lockdown. The total of confirmed and probable cases in New Zealand to 1,210. Some 282 patients have recovered from the virus.  ##Health## California has secured deals to acquire more than 200 million protective masks each month for medical workers combating the coronavirus, the state's Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday.\u00a0 Newsom made the announcement during an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s The Rachel Maddow Show, saying when it comes to states competing against one another for masks, \u201cenough is enough.\u201d \"In the past 48 hours, we have secured through a consortium of nonprofits and manufacturers here in the state of California upwards of 200 million masks on a monthly basis that we're confident we can supply the needs of the state of California and potentially the needs of other western states,\u201d said Newsom.\u00a0\n\u201cWe inked a number of contracts in the last few days that give me confidence in being able to say that.\"  Newsom says the state is expecting more than 150 million N95 masks and more than 50 million surgical masks per month. The masks will be manufactured overseas, and will begin to arrive in the next few weeks. ##Health## ##Business## Musician John Prine has died after being hospitalized due to coronavirus. This is what his publicist told CNN: \"We can confirm on behalf of the Prine family -- John died today at Vanderbilt due to complications of Covid-19.\u201d The 73-year-old was hospitalized last month and was in a critical condition after a \"sudden onset\" of coronavirus symptoms. The\u00a0Grammy Award-winning\u00a0singer and songwriter had a nearly 50-year career playing a blend of country and folk music. Born in 1946, the\u00a0Songwriters Hall of Fame\u00a0says that Prine began his career in Chicago in the late 1960s after learning guitar aged 14. Songs from his 1971 debut album were later covered by musicians including Johnny Cash, Bonnie Raitt, John Denver and Norah Brown. In a 2009 interview, Bob Dylan listed Prine as\u00a0one of his favorite songwriters. In 1981, Prine and his manager founded\u00a0Oh Boy Records\u00a0in Nashville, Tennessee.\u00a0According to the label, it is the second-oldest artist-owned independent record label in the US. Prine\u00a0survived cancer twice. In the late 1990s, he had surgery to remove cancer from his neck. The operation removed a piece of his neck and changed the tone of his voice, deepening it and giving it a gravelly sound. In 2013, he underwent surgery to remove cancer in his left lung. ##Health## Normally they would be serving customers thousands of feet in the air, but with coronavirus grounding most of Singapore Airlines' fleet, its cabin crew are helping out in a different way. On Tuesday, the first group of cabin crew members started as \"care ambassadors\" at Singapore's Khoo Teck Puat hospital. The Singapore Airlines' flight crew will be providing manpower to overworked medical teams, basic care to patients, and nutritional care in low-risk wards, according to a news release from the hospital. So far, 30 care ambassadors have joined the program, after receiving vaccinations and a medical screening, followed by a 90-minute hospital orientation.  The secondment is expected to last for three months. \u201cWe are very pleased to collaborate with Singapore Airlines as this helps augment our manpower needs, at a challenging time when many of our staff have been diverted to care for COVID-19 related patients,\" chief nurse Shirley Heng said in the hospital's statement. ##Daily Life## ##Business## After more than two months of lockdown, Wuhan -- ground zero for the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic -- is finally reopening its borders.  Apart from the easing of travel restrictions, there is another sign that the city is starting to move on from the crisis: It has finally started to bury the dead. Grief put on hold: For months, residents in Wuhan had been unable to bury their loved ones, as the government banned all funerals and closed cemeteries on January 25. The remains of thousands of people who died both from coronavirus and other causes were stored at funeral homes. Families were told to await government advice on when they could be collected. Many didn't get to see the body of their loved ones: To curb the spread of the virus, all bodies of confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients were taken directly from hospitals to funeral homes for cremation, according to a notice issued by the National Health Commission. Restrictions eased: In late March, Wuhan residents were finally able to retrieve the ashes of their relatives from funeral homes and find them a resting place, reported the state-run Changjiang Daily, citing an official from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. The news came just ahead of the Ching Ming Festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day -- when Chinese people honor the dead. Funeral ceremonies still not permitted: It is not clear what rituals family members are allowed to observe when laying their loved ones to rest.

But even as Wuhan reopens its borders after 76 days, some restrictions within the city will remain in place, and officials warn that the threat of further infections remains far from over. The metropolis of 11 million, where the coronavirus was first\u00a0detected in December,\u00a0had been\u00a0sealed off from the outside world\u00a0since January 23 in an unprecedented effort to contain the outbreak. What this means for Wuhan: On Wednesday, healthy residents and visitors\u00a0will finally\u00a0be allowed to leave Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, with trains and flights resumed and highway entrances reopened. Wuhan's railway authority estimated more than 55,000 passengers will leave Wuhan by train Wednesday, with about 40% bound for the Pearl River Delta region, a major manufacturing hub in China, according to state broadcaster CCTV. What this means for China: The easing of travel restrictions on Wuhan is the latest milestone in China's fight against Covid-19. The country reported nearly zero new local infections in recent weeks, leading to similar restrictive measures being lifted for other parts of Hubei province late last month. Luo Ping, an epidemic control official in Wuhan,\u00a0told CCTV\u00a0Sunday that the lifting of the lockdown marks a \"full restart\" of the city's economic and social activities from their previous \"suspension.\" But he warned the city faces an arduous task preventing imported cases and a recurrence of local infections. \"After work and production resumed, the movement of people increased and so did the risk of cross-infections from mass gatherings. Some residents have dropped their guard and don't wear masks when they go on the streets,\" he told the broadcaster.\n\"The reopening of Wuhan does not mean the all-clear, neither does it mean a relaxing of epidemic prevention and control measures (within the city),\" he said.

Now, the Long Island county is planning to use a refrigerated building on a farm to help store bodies, a county spokesman confirmed to CNN. \u201cAt the early stages of this crisis, we were having conversations about suggestions of using ice rinks and stores with refrigeration to store bodies,\u201d Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said in a statement to CNN. \u201cI made the decision that I was not going to tell families that we need to convert their children\u2019s ice-skating rinks and turn them into morgues because that is not who we are.\u201d Bellone decided, instead, to use facilities on the Suffolk County Farm, which is run by the Cornell Cooperative Extension but owned by the county.  There is a building on site that has large, unused refrigeration system, Bellone\u2019s spokesperson Jason Elan said.  The county\u2019s morgue capabilities, which includes a refrigerated trailer from the state, are half full, Elan said, adding that another trailer is expected to arrive later on Tuesday. After those are filled, the farm\u2019s refrigerator would be used.\u00a0\u00a0 Bellone\u2019s administration has also requested more body bags from the state. \u201cI\u2019m having conversations I never imagined having in this position,\u201d Bellone said. ##Daily Life## Minutes after President Donald Trump said he's placing a \"very powerful hold\" on US funding to the World Health Organization for what he says is a \"China-centric\" stance, he appeared to back off the statement. \"I'm not saying I'm going to do it, but we are going to look at it,\" Trump said after being pressed on his statement. Speaking Tuesday at his daily coronavirus briefing, Trump said the organization \"receives vast amounts of money from the United States\" that he wants to re-examine. Trump said certain WHO programs were worthwhile but that overall they'd made mistakes -- in particular, he said, opposition to his decision to shut down travel from China. \"We have to look into that, so we're going to look into it,\" Trump said.
