To celebrate, we've gathered up some of the latest and greatest backyard memory-makers \u2014 games that we've tried and love ourselves, or that come courtesy of some of our favorite brands, have high customer reviews, or all of the above.

Ages 13-17 Americana Deluxe Tiki Hook and Ring Game ($39.99; etsy.com) It may seem easy \u2014 just swing the ring on its cord over the hook \u2014 but it isn't. You can mount this onto a tree or attach it to an overhang, but if those aren't an option, the steel telescoping pole lets you set it up wherever you like.   _______________________________________________________________________________ Quest Traditional Cornhole Board Set ($99.98, originally $149.99; dickssportinggoods.com) If your teens have never played cornhole, what better time than now to give them an introduction? This authentic set is approved by the American Cornhole Association (yes, there is such an association, and it takes its approvals seriously).

Bonus: The legs fold up, so it's easy to put away.  _______________________________________________________________________________ KanJam Disc Game ($39.99; amazon.com) This is kind of like bean bag toss, but with discs instead of bean bags, and two targets (kans) set far apart. The KanJam app explains all the rules and lets you download videos and a scorekeeper.   _______________________________________________________________________________ 4 in a Row ($66.07; homedepot.com) Outdoor fun doesn't require advance planning or setup. On a nice night, you and your teen can get some air by grabbing this 3-foot outdoor game (it comes in a tote bag) and heading out on the patio. The game itself operates on the same principle as tic-tac-toe, but much trickier.   _______________________________________________________________________________ TrekLightGear Light Up Bocce Ball Set ($63.71, originally $74.95; etsy.com) The object of bocce is to get your ball as close to the pallino (target ball) as possible, without it being knocked out of the way by your opponent. Each ball in this set has a built-in LED light. These aren't just \"glow in the dark\" balls, which often require a full day in the sun to actually glow. Each weatherproof ball has a switch that lets you opt for a solid bright glow or a flashing one. Your fur kid Harry Barker Camper Fetch Set ($8; amazon.com) Every dog likes to play fetch. But do those balls ever get gross fast!
