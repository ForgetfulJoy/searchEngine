He\u2019s a British beekeeper and producer making electronic music incorporating the sounds of bees. You can\u2019t really bring bees into a recording studio, of course. They\u2019d swarm the mic. So Bioni records the insects buzzing in their hives using homemade equipment. He extracts samples from the recordings and data, and processes the sounds through his Hive Synthesizer, which uses honey as an organic electrical resistor. People at music festivals all around the world can dance to Bioni\u2019s beats and learn about colony collapse disorder at the same time. Bees have been dying at an alarming rate, and we need to save these pollinators if agriculture is to survive."], "Language": false}
