We were on a mission to track down the latest and greatest toys from heavy hitters like Lego, Hasbro and Mattel \u2014 and we weren't disappointed. The Child (aka the lovable and truly epic Baby Yoda) was nearly everywhere. There were plush toys from Mattel, animatronic dolls from Hasbro and a buildable Razor Crest ship from Lego.  Pie Face was the craze a few years back, and interactive games and board games are still at the heart of the toy industry. Deer Pong might be our personal favorite, but Hasbro's Connect 4 Blast! is an exciting new way to play the classic game. And it wouldn't be a new year without some new versions of Monopoly, with this year's releases including credit cards with rewards, Sonic and a political version.  The \"Star Wars\"-inspired toys don't end with Baby Yoda. Hasbro will let you journey to Hoth with a new board game celebrating the 40th anniversary of \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" You can also pick from a collection of figures \u2014 Luke, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Yoda, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian and many others are back in retro packaging. You can even score a Boba Fett or Luke Skywalker-esque Pilot helmet complete with working LEDs.  Here are all the best new toys that caught our attention at the New York Toy Fair.
