Residents of Los Angeles should wear non-medical grade face coverings when in public, the city's mayor Eric Garcetti said in a news conference Tuesday. Garcetti emphasized that all medical-grade N95 masks were reserved for front-line workers in hospitals and clinics. \u201cPlease do not get medical grade or surgical masks, or N95 masks. We must not contribute to the shortage of these essential personal protective equipment for medial personnel and first responders,\u201d he said. Face coverings, like a bandanna, are only effective with safe physical distancing, he added. There are currently 8,155 cases of the virus in California. Global debate on face masks: Despite the regular use of masks in Asian countries such as China and South Korea, Western governments have been slow to embrace them to stop the spread of the virus. But with the number of new cases remaining low or stable in Asia, it appears that more countries in the West may change their approach. ##Health## President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the UK and Canada were making plans to repatriate their citizens from two Holland America cruise ships currently off the coast of Florida. \"We are looking at the two ships. And we have Canada notified, lot of Canadians, a lot of British on the ship, they are coming to take the people that are on the ship back to their homeland,\" he said.\n\"Canada is coming, the UK is coming. And we have Americans\u00a0and we have some people that are quite sick and we\u2019re taking care of that, I'm speaking with the governor about that.\" Two cruise ships off Florida coast: Both the Zaandam and the Rotterdam are currently on their way to Florida, and have requested permission to disembark guests. \u201cWe appreciate the support of President Trump in resolving the humanitarian plight of our guests,\u201d Holland America said in a statement. \u201cHolland America Line calls for compassion and reason in the review and approval of our disembarkation plan by Florida officials.\u201d Since March 22, 83 passengers and 136 crew onboard the Zaandam have exhibited flu-like symptoms. Eight passengers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Four people on the Zaandam have died, but the cause of their deaths is unknown. On the Rotterdam, 14 passengers have exhibited flu-like symptoms. ##Travel## Dr. Deborah Birx said a coronavirus antibody test could be available \u201cwithin this month\u201d and says\u00a0\u201cI've really called on every\u00a0university and every state to\u00a0develop ELISA\u2019s, you can buy the antigens and the\u00a0controls online, and really work\u00a0to test entire health care\u00a0communities in your state and\u00a0support them that way.\u201d The ELISA, or\u00a0enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,\u00a0test detects and measures antibodies in blood. If successful, the test could help identify those who have already had the virus, but have since recovered.  Experts say that if a person has had the virus and developed antibodies, it will most likely mean they have built up immunity and the chances of that person being infected again drops dramatically.\u00a0 Birx said that the test could help identify frontline medical workers who may have had the coronavirus and not know it. \u201cI think really being able to\u00a0tell them, the peace of mind\u00a0that would come from knowing you\u00a0already were infected, you have\u00a0the antibody, you are safe from\u00a0reinfection.\u00a099.9% of the time,\" Birx said. Birx said a first test could be available, \u201csoon, within this month if the universities help us, absolutely.\u201d Watch: ##Health## There have been at least 917 new coronavirus deaths reported in the US on Wednesday, according to a count by CNN Health.\u00a0 This is the most reported deaths in the United States in a single day since the coronavirus outbreak. There have been a total of 4,745 deaths reported in the US since the outbreak. Hear more: Wyoming remains the only state in the US without a death from coronavirus. So far, there are 137 positive cases in the state, according to CNN's tally. Adam Schlesinger, a prolific songwriter for film and television and co-founder of the band Fountains of Wayne, has died from complications of Covid-19.\u00a0He was 52. \"As many of you are aware, Adam had been hospitalized with Covid-19 and although he had been making some small improvements over the last few days, Adam\u2019s condition was critical and he was ultimately unable to recover from Covid-19 complications,\" read a statement from an attorney for Fountains of Wayne, provided to CNN. Schlesinger wrote the title track for \"That Thing You Do,\" the 1996 film directed by and starring Tom Hanks.  More recently, he wrote and produced music for the show \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\" He won multiple Emmy Awards, a Grammy and was an Oscar and Tony Award nominee. The Fountains of Wayne song \"Stacy's Mom,\" a pop hit from 2003, was among the group's most popular songs. The Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships are expected to arrive and remain off the coast of Florida early Thursday while they wait for clearance from US authorities, according to a statement from Holland America.\u00a0 The company made a plea to President Trump, Florida authorities and the public to be allowed to arrive to Florida. \u201cWe appreciate the support of President Trump in resolving the humanitarian plight of our guests,\u201d Holland America said in a statement. \u201cHolland America Line calls for compassion and reason in the review and approval of our disembarkation plan by Florida officials.\u201d The cruise line called the status on the ships a \u201chumanitarian situation.\u201d Four people on the ship have died and at least eight people have tested positive for Covid-19. Since March 22, 97 guests (83 on Zaandam and 14 on Rotterdam) and 136 crew on the Zaandam have exhibited flu-like symptoms, according to the statement. About 45 guests have mild illness and are unfit to travel. These passengers would stay isolated on board until they recover, per the press release. Holland America says less than 10 people need immediate critical care onshore and it has secured a local health system to treat them. \u201cThis small number is the only group that will require any support from medical resources in Broward County and is necessary to prevent further harm to their health,\u201d Holland America said in a statement When asked Wednesday evening during a coronavirus task force briefing why he didn't issue a universal stay-at-home order for the entirety of the country, President Trump implied that some states are basically fine when it comes to the disease.  \"There are some states that don't have much of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some, well they don't have the problem, they don't have thousands of people that are positive or thousands of people that even think they might have it, or hundreds of people in some cases.\" Facts First:\u00a0The entire country\u00a0has been impacted by the coronavirus.\u00a0Americans have tested positive\u00a0in every US state and all but one territory. As of the start of Wednesday's press briefing, all 50 states\u00a0had\u00a0at least 100 cases. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said that Georgia could \"reach\u00a0peak hospital capacity on April 23.\" \"As of this morning, we had 3,520 medical surgical beds, 450 beds and 1,006 ventilators available in our hospitals across the state. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, Georgia will reach peak hospital capacity on April 23,\" Kemp said during his Wednesday press conference.  Kemp added: \"That's nearly three weeks from today. This model assumes that Georgians continue to abide by the state's orders and use social distancing methods through the end of May.\" Grand Canyon National Park announced its closure \u201cimmediately\u201d in a press release Wednesday evening. The National Park Service said it is closing the park based on the recommendation of the chief health officer in Coconino County, Arizona.\u00a0 The park had been operating with very limited services, but resisted a call from the Coalition to Protect America\u2019s National Parks and other groups to close entirely. \"The Department of the Interior and the National Park Service will continue to follow the guidance of state and local health officials in making determinations about our operations,\"\u00a0Interior Secretary David Bernhardt\u00a0said in a statement. ##Daily Life## President Trump said learning about the \u201cseverity\u201d of the novel coronavirus led to his recent shift in tone away from comparing the virus to the flu as he did in the early days of the pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cI think also, and looking at the way \u2014 the contagion \u2014 it is so contagious. Nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like this, where large groups of people all of a sudden, just by being in the presence of somebody, have it,\u201d Trump said at the coronavirus task force briefing Wednesday. The President was asked about the unnamed friend whose struggle with the virus Trump has cited at least twice in previous briefings. Trump has said this friend slipped into a coma. \u201cAlso the violence of it \u2014 if it hits the right person, and you know what those stats are, if it hits the right person that persons in deep trouble. And my friend was the right person,\u201d Trump said. The President stopped short of saying his friend\u2019s condition was a turning point in his view of the virus, saying his view shifted due to the data he was presented. \u201cBut it hit him very hard. He\u2019s strong, very strong kind of a guy, but he\u2019s older, he\u2019s heavier and he\u2019s sort of central casting for what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Trump said. Watch: President Trump said he won't issue a national stay-at-home order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases. \u201cStates are\u00a0different and I understand that\u00a0the governor of Florida, great\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis issued one today and that\u2019s good, that\u2019s great.\u00a0But there are some states that are\u00a0different.\u00a0There are some states that don't\u00a0have much of a problem,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states depending on how bad individual states situations might be. \u201cYou have to look \u2014 you have to\u00a0give a little\u00a0flexibility.\u00a0If you have a state in the\u00a0Midwest, or if Alaska for\u00a0example doesn't have a problem,\u00a0it's awfully tough to say close it down.\u00a0We have to have a little bit of\u00a0flexibility,\u201d Trump said. Some context: Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the 30 days to slow the spread guidelines should be viewed as a national stay-at-home order on Wednesday morning.\u00a0 \u201cMy advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay-at-home order. There are guidelines that say, look, the more we social distance, the more we stay at home, the less spread of disease there will be,\u201d Adams said.\u00a0 Watch: President Trump said the administration is considering cutting off coronavirus \u201chot spots\u201d from air travel, but added that such a move would be \u201cvery tough.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about doing that, at the same time we just, you know, to start these airlines and to start this whole thing over is very tough,\u201d the President said. \u201cAnd you have them going in some cases from going to hot spot to hot spot.\" \u201cOnce you do that,\u201d Trump added, \u201cyou really are clamping down an industry that is desperately needed.\u201d Trump said the calculation between keeping the industry afloat and spreading the virus, \u201cis a calculation we\u2019re looking at right now. We\u2019re looking at it very strongly.\u201d Watch: ##Travel## Canadian officials say the government is telling them the stockpile for medical supplies may not be enough to combat the novel coronavirus. \"To your question about whether we had enough \u2014 no, we likely did not have enough. I think federal governments for decades have been under-funding things like public health preparedness,\" Patty Hajdu, Canada\u2019s health minister, said during a news conference in Ottawa on Wednesday. \"I have heard those stories myself from frontline workers, I know provinces and territories are developing different sets of rules for frontline workers around the dispersement, and use of personal protective equipment,\" Hajdu added. Several hospitals in Ontario and Quebec, the worst affected provinces in Canada, are now telling medical staff to ration their supplies of protective equipment. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government continues to work to find supplies around the world and he says he is working hard on \"made in Canada\" solutions. \u201cWe recognize the challenges frontline health workers are facing in different parts of the country. We are working very closely with the provincial authorities in charge of those healthcare systems to try and meet the needs that they\u2019re facing,\" Trudeau said during a press conference Wednesday. \"We are facing \u2013 looking at a global demand for these supplies that is unprecedented. Countries around the world are trying to get more of these supplies. We are expecting to see some shipments coming in very shortly that will help in Canada.\" When asked if the\u00a0US Strategic National Stockpile is nearly depleted, President Trump told reporters \u201cIt is.\u00a0We are sending it directly to\u00a0hospitals.\u201d Trump went on to echo statements he made yesterday that the federal government wants supplies to be directly shipped where they are needed, rather than sitting in a warehouse.\u00a0 \u201cWe don't want it to come to the\u00a0stockpiles because then we have\u00a0to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals,\u201d Trump said Wednesday during a coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cWe have asked states where they\u00a0have large manufacturers of\u00a0different types of equipment to\u00a0use those local factories, local\u00a0plants and have it made\u00a0directly, ship it right into the\u00a0hospitals.\" Some context: The Strategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory, depleting the bulk of its protective gear, a source familiar told CNN earlier today. The official added that the stockpile was never meant to serve as the only source of protective gear for the entire coronavirus response and they said the states would need to get more supply from the private market. \u00a0 New York City has 45,707 coronavirus cases and 1,374 deaths,\u00a0according to the city\u2019s website. Today there has been 3,936 new cases and 278 new deaths. New York state as a while has 83,712 coronavirus cases and 1,941 deaths, according to CNN's tally. There have been at least 869 coronavirus deaths reported in the US on Wednesday, according to a count by CNN Health. This is the most reported deaths in the United States in a single day since the novel coronavirus outbreak. There have been a total of 4,703 deaths reported in the US since the outbreak.\u00a0 Colorado Gov. Jared Polis announced in a press briefing on Wednesday that the state has been talking to Chinese factory owners, and others, to purchase medical equipment. \"We know that not having gotten nearly enough from the federal government, we have really taken it upon ourselves as a state to engage in the purchasing of medical equipment,\" Polis said. According to the governor, Colorado has a \"monumental task\" at hand to build medical capacity at this critical time. And the state is not just facing a healthcare crisis; it is also facing a supply chain crisis, Polis added. \"We simply do not have the medical capacity, the beds, hospital beds, ICU units, ventilators, personal protection equipment to treat everybody who might get sick and have the potential to get better,\" the governor said.\u00a0\"We placed a number of purchase orders, and we have a number of supplies that are in transit or in the supply chain, all subject to verification. We want to verify that the masks work and that they are not counterfeit.\" By the numbers: Colorado has ordered 2.5 million N95 Masks,\u00a0750 ventilators,\u00a01.5 million gloves, one million surgical masks, 25,000 face shields and 250,000 gowns, according to the governor.\u00a0 Colorado has a total of 3,338 coronavirus cases with 77 deaths, according to CNN's tally. The spread of the novel coronavirus may occur before patients present with symptoms, according to a report released Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The transmission of the novel coronavirus before the development of symptoms might occur through respiratory droplets\u00a0or indirect transmission, according to the report. \u00a0 \u201cThese findings also suggest that to control the pandemic it might not be enough for only persons with symptoms to limit their contact with others because persons without symptoms might transmit infection,\u201d the report said.\u00a0\"Evidence of presymptomatic transmission \u2026 underscores the critical role social distancing \u2026 plays in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\u00a0 Russian medical supplies to help the US combat the Covid-19 pandemic landed in New York\u00a0on Wednesday afternoon, the Russian mission to the UN tweeted out. The mission tweeted that the supplies would \u201chelp local communities and hospitals in their crucial action against the spread of #coronanvirus.\u201d The New York Air Traffic Controller thanked the Russian pilot when the plane landed at JFK airport.\u00a0 \u201cRomeo Foxtrot Foxtrot 8460 Heavy, we sincerely thank you for all the assistance you are bringing in,\u201d the controller said. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d The shipment includes personal protective equipment including masks, ventilators, and antiseptics a State Department official told CNN. The US will put all Food and Drug Administration approved items to immediate use, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.\u00a0 Some context: The shipment comes just days after President Trump and President Vladimir Putin spoke over the phone.  The Russian assistance was not mentioned in the readout of their call provided by the White House. But\u00a0earlier this week Trump said that \"Russia sent us a very, very large planeload of things, medical equipment, which was very nice.\" Last month, before that phone call, the State Department urged diplomats worldwide to ask for medical supplies from their host countries, but said that they would not be asking Russia. The Strategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory,\u00a0depleting the bulk of its protective gear,\u00a0a source familiar told CNN. The official said the stockpile was never meant to serve as the only source of protective gear for the entire coronavirus response and the states would need to get more supply from the private market.\u00a0 The official stressed that the stockpile, which is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services, will never be completely depleted as they always retain a small percentage for the most critical needs.\u00a0 Some context: Since the start of the pandemic, officials have been sounding the alarm that there was never going to be enough gear for a 50-state response. On Tuesday, President Trump said the government would hold onto 10,000 ventilators to ensure they had the ability to deploy quickly if they need the units in the future. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said the agency's planning for the\u00a0Covid-19 pandemic response \"acknowledged that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) alone could not fulfill all requirements at the State and tribal level. Therefore, as the vice president stated last night, the federal government will exhaust all means to identify and attain medical and other supplies needed to combat the virus.\" A Department of Homeland Security\u00a0official told CNN the stockpile is \"near depletion because the numbers are low.\" \"When you see demand is outpacing supply, then we go to the people [states] who are asking for equipment and ask if they are exhausting all of their sources,\" the official said.\u00a0\"We are having to balance places that don't have any [PPE], versus someone on the verge, but not there yet.\" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said the state reached\u00a0a\u00a0\u201ctragic milestone\u201d with the death of an infant with coronavirus.  \u201cA 6-week-old newborn from the Hartford area was brought unresponsive to a hospital late last week and could not be revived,\u201d Lamont tweeted. \"Testing confirmed last night that the newborn was Covid-19 positive. This is absolutely heartbreaking. We believe this is one of the youngest lives lost anywhere due to complications relating to Covid-19.\" Read Lamont's tweets: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said religious services conducted in churches, synagogues and houses of worship are \u201cessential business\u201d\u00a0and therefore exempt from this stay-at-home executive order announced this afternoon.\u00a0 The stay-at-home order issued by DeSantis goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Friday.\u00a0 According to 2019 Census data, the population of the state has over 21 million people. Florida has 6,946 confirmed coronavirus cases and 86 deaths, according to CNN's tally. Some context: Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne said he wouldn't close the doors of his Tampa, Florida, megachurch until the End Times begin. The police weren't willing to wait that long. On Monday, Florida sheriff's deputies arrested the evangelical pastor, who has continued to host large church services despite public orders urging residents to stay home to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said Howard-Browne has been charged with two counts: unlawful assembly and a violation of health emergency rules. Both are second-degree misdemeanors, Chronister said at a press conference Monday. ##Health## As states around the country issue \"stay-at-home\" orders amid the coronavirus pandemic, firearm and ammunition retailers have been designated an \"essential service,\" according to updated guidance from the federal government.\u00a0 Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, identified \"firearm and ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors, and shooting ranges\" as critical infrastructure in the updated \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce\" advisory, which was issued over the weekend. The list is intended to be advisory and not to be considered \"the exclusive list of critical infrastructure sectors, workers, and functions that should continue during the Covid-19 response across all jurisdictions.\" \"Individual jurisdictions should add or subtract essential workforce categories based on their own requirements and discretion,\" the advisory states. Some context: The Covid-19 health crisis has prompted at least 30 states and the District of Columbia to issue stay-at-home orders that force the closure of \"non-essential services.\" Firearm retailers haven't been specifically mentioned in some states' lists of essential businesses, so they're assumed to be non-essential. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp held a press conference Wednesday afternoon and announced that a state-wide shelter-in-place will go into effect on Friday. \"Tomorrow, I will sign a state-wide shelter-in-place order, which will go into effect on Friday, and run through April 13, 2020. This date is in line with our public health emergency order,\" Kemp said. Kemp also added that public schools will be closed for the remainder of the school year. \"I will sign an executive order today closing K through 12 public schools for the rest of the school year,\" Kemp said.  He added that \"online learning will continue.\" ##Daily Life##\u00a0 More than 8,000 people in California have coronavirus, and 171 people have died as a result of the virus, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in a virtual press conference. Today\u2019s count adds 1,223 more Covid-19 patients to California\u2019s tally \u2013 an increase of more than 17% from yesterday \u2014\u00a0for a total of 8,155 cases in the state. The governor is keenly focused on how many coronavirus patients are hospitalized, especially in intensive care units. There are 774 patients in ICU beds. That number has quadrupled in the past six days. Hospitalizations from the virus have tripled in that same time frame and currently stands at 1,855 people. Los Angeles County has 513 new cases and 11 deaths, state Health Director Barbara Ferrer announced today. In a matter of 48-hours, more than 1,000 more coronavirus cases have been confirmed in L.A. County. ##Health## New York City hospitals still need 3.3 million N95 masks, 2.1 million surgical masks, 100,000 isolation gowns and 400 ventilators by this coming Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference today. He estimated that the city needs an additional 2,500 to 3,000 ventilators over the course of next week. De Blasio has been warning for roughly the past week that Sunday, is a crucial day for New York, as he expects the demands to continue to increase in the following weeks. Former NYPD commissioner James O\u2019Neill has been appointed to oversee the supply and distribution of personal protective equipment and medical equipment within New York City hospitals as the demands continue to grow as a result of the coronavirus crisis, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in a press release on Wednesday. In this role, O\u2019Neill will \u201ccreate, operationalize and manage a supply inspection regime within the hospitals to ensure the rapid turnaround of new supplies and verify each hospital is pushing needed equipment to frontline health care workers,\u201d according to the mayor\u2019s office. ##Health## Today represents the deadliest day to date by a CNN count of coronavirus deaths.  The current total of 4,669 deaths represents an increase of 835 cases. Yesterday was the previous high, with 830 deaths. ##Health## The UN climate change conference COP 26, which was planned for November in Glasgow, has been postponed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. A new date for the conference, hosted by the UK and other partners, has yet to be decided on and will be announced following discussions between the parties. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont asked how the battle for personal protective equipment and ventilators is going with the national stockpile depleted. \u201cIt\u2019s not going that well\u201d Lamont said. \u201cWe\u2019re down there fighting every day\u201d adding that a team of at least 40 people is sourcing down every protective gear lead it can coming from all over the world. \u201cWe\u2019re scrambling at this stuff\u201d the governor said. Lamont described the frustrating process that his state is going through. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it on the tarmac, then it's rerouted we have it ready for delivery and then it's put off for another week and it\u2019s a bit of a mess out there, and you\u2019re playing with people\u2019s lives\u201d Lamont said, echoing his previous sentiments on CNN\u2019s Sit Room this week. ##Health## Henry Ford Health System said one of its six hospitals in Michigan has \"reached capacity,\" after a\u00a0photo\u00a0of a doctor from the Macomb hospital with the caption \u201cno more ICU beds,\u201d circulated Twitter. Covid-19 cases have flooded Michigan, specifically the Southeast region near Detroit. A statement provided from Dr. Adnan Munkarah, EVP and Chief Clinical Officer, confirmed the issue to CNN: \u201cWe are continuing to balance ICU capacity across our health system, transferring patients when necessary. Like some of our other acute care hospitals, Henry Ford Macomb Hospital has reached capacity and we are working aggressively with clinical partners in the region in an effort to transfer additional patients.\u201d The status of the other five hospitals was not readily available, but in its daily update, the hospital system said it had 360 intensive care units all together.

Louisiana has 6,424 coronavirus cases and 273 deaths, according to CNN's tally.  ##Health## The general who oversees US military operations in North America said Wednesday there \u201cis actually an increased demand signal, not a decreased demand signal for securing the southern border,\u201d regarding possible migrants who test positive for coronavirus coming across the border As such, General Terrance O\u2019Shaughnessy said the military is \u201cincreasing our presence on the southern border.\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy, who is commander of US Northern Command, made the comments to reporters over the telephone. In the same briefing,\u00a0Lt. Gen. Laura Richardson, the commanding general, US Army North, said there would be an 540 additional troops sent and they would be arriving \u201cvery soon.\u201d Some context: CNN reported Monday,\u00a0that the Pentagon approved a Department of Homeland Security request for additional personnel on the southern border to help DHS cope with potential coronavirus related issues, a US defense official told CNN.  The number of additional troops is expected to be about 540. The US military personnel will be performing similar missions to those currently being performed by forces on the US-Mexico border. ##Travel## The field hospital in Central Park is now open and has taken in its first patient, Melissa Nystrom, a spokesperson for Samaritan\u2019s Purse told CNN.

We all felt so defeated by this virus.\u201d But this nurse\u00a0says\u00a0that their hospital is doing everything possible to treat Covid-19 patients, saying it\u2019s like throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks.  \u201cThey\u2019re trying all the drugs others are using, even combining them,\" the nurse said.

And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything, every day was all about impeachment.\" During a press briefing on Tuesday, Trump echoed that argument, saying that impeachment \"probably did\" distract him from responding to the coronavirus outbreak. \"I think I handled it very well, but I guess it probably did (distract me),\" Trump said. \"I mean, I got impeached.

In a\u00a0blog post\u00a0on Monday, the Economic Policy Institute estimates that this will bring\u00a0unemployment rates \u201cinto the mid-teens.\u201d The estimates account for the recently enacted CARES Act and assumes a fourth coronavirus relief bill, EPI said. Some more perspective: Goldman Sachs has significantly downgraded its outlook for the US economy between April and June. The investment bank now expects an annualized rate of contraction of 34% compared to the previous quarter. The last estimate was an already-shocking 24%. Goldman revised its forecast because it thinks the US labor market collapse will be even worse than anticipated. It now sees the unemployment rate rising to 15% by the middle of the year, compared to 9% before. The bank has also updated its predictions for an economic rebound between July and September, which it thinks will be stronger than what it had last penciled in. But in the interim, Wall Street is clearly bracing for pain. ##Daily Life## ##Business## The United States has now surpassed 200,000 cases of coronavirus.

The Navy has every expectation that the number will rise, source added. About 1,000 of more than 4,000 crew members have been tested so far. The official said about 1,000 sailors have been moved ashore in Guam and that is expected to rise to 3,000 in the coming days.\u00a0\u00a0 Guam\u2019s Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero said on Wednesday she will allow sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in\u00a0Guam\u00a0if they test negative for coronavirus and undergo a 14-day quarantine.\u00a0 Some context: CNN reported Tuesday that\u00a0the commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US Navy aircraft carrier where an\u00a0outbreak of the coronavirus\u00a0has spread to at least 70 sailors, has warned Navy leadership that decisive action is required to save the lives of the ship's crew. \"We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2014 our Sailors,\" Capt. Brett Crozier wrote in a memo to the Navy's Pacific Fleet, three US defense officials have confirmed to CNN. Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly told CNN's John King Tuesday that the Navy was working to get the sailors off the ship. \"We don't disagree with the (Commanding Officer) on that ship and we're doing it in a very methodical way because it's not the same as a cruise ship, that ship has armaments on it, it has aircraft on it, we have to be able to fight fires if there are fires on board the ship, we have to run a nuclear power plant, so there's a lot of things that we have to do on that ship that make it a little bit different and unique but we're managing it and we're working through it,\" he added. ##Health## The famous Wimbledon tennis tournament has been canceled, organizers announced today. \"It is with great regret that the AELTC has today decided that The Championships 2020 will be cancelled due to public health concerns linked to the coronavirus epidemic,\" tournament organizers said in a statement.

In the meantime, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said that there are three things you should do if you decide to wear a mask.\u00a0 He broke it down on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Wednesday: Don't touch your face: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to wear a face covering, please try not to touch your face. Please be very, very careful about making sure you don\u2019t touch your face,\u201d Adams told NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie.\nDon't use an N95: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to wear a face covering, please save the N95 masks for healthcare workers who need them,\u201d Adams said. \nStay at home: \u201cWearing a face covering does not mean that you don\u2019t have to practice social distancing. The most important thing you can do is stay at home right now, and we don\u2019t want people to feel like \u2018OK I\u2019m covering my face so now it\u2019s OK for me to go out in public,'\" he said. ##Health## ##Daily Life## The Delhi government has announced that it has started tracking the phones of people who are suspected to have coronavirus and have been quarantined at their home. \u201cWe have made a decision and with help from the police, people who have been asked to quarantine themselves at home, we will track their phones over the past few days to ensure that they were staying at home,\u201d said Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister.

Frieden appeared on \u201cCBS This Morning\" and said \"we can't expect seasons here,\" However, he added the US \"should be able to gradually reopen if we do the rights things.\" \"Look at countries around the world that have been able to tamp this down and then gradually loosen the faucet and get back to a new normal, normal, but a new normal, but not open the floodgates,\" Frieden said. \"What does that mean? That means that people who are over the age of 60 or who have underlying medical problems may need to stay home for longer.\" ##Health## The US coronavirus crisis has hit all 50 states but there is some good news, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said on the \"Today\" show on Wednesday. \u201cThe good news is that states like Washington, like California, countries like Italy, when they leaned into aggressive mitigation, they\u2019re being able to flatten their curve and we know that if you do this that it usually takes about three to four weeks from the time you start to lean into it before you level it off,\u201d Adams told NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie.\u00a0Washington and California were home to some of the earliest Covid-19 cases in the United States. \u201cWe want nationally people to understand the importance of social distancing,\u201d Adams said.\u00a0 Yet each state has its own curve and \u201cthe governors get to make the decisions, but we\u2019re going to give them the best possible guidance we can and that's to stay at home and social distance,\" Adams said.\u00a0 \u201cEveryone is on a different place on their curve. Some places aren\u2019t going to hit their peak until after 30 days and they\u2019re going to need to continue social distancing. Other places that leaned in early may be able to relax some of their recommendations earlier.\u201d ##Health## The UK is reporting 563 more deaths\u00a0from Covid-19 \u2014 the most deaths recorded in a 24 hour time period yet.

Right now, states, counties and cities are deciding their own social distancing guidelines.\u00a0Wen\u00a0said a national response would be better.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is important to mention that the longer we have this piecemeal approach, the longer it will take for all of us to get back to normal,\u201d\u00a0Wen\u00a0said, adding, \u201cBut the sooner we can get everything under control and having national coordinated response, the better it is.\u201d\u00a0 Wen\u00a0said, \u201cmost people would speculate that we need at least 8 to 10 weeks of social distancing for this to work at all.\u201d\u00a0 \"We also need the federal government to do a lot more, too. Because that rationing of ventilators, the rationing of supplies, that is also going to be what leads to unnecessary deaths.

He continued: \u201cThose\u00a0projections\u00a0are definitely sobering, but they don\u2019t have to be our reality. If we really do our part \u2014 stay at home, social distance \u2014 then we can flatten our curve even below those projections, but it really depends on all of us,\" Adams said.\u00a0\"As surgeon general, I'm going to do my best to get you the information you need. We're going to do our best as the Task Force to make sure the federal support is there, but we need state and we need local people to come together with federal support to make this possible.\" ##Health## US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said on the \u201cToday\u201d show that he has been in talks with the head of the national stockpile to come up with a \"better way\" for states to access the ventilators that are needed to treat some of the sickest Covid-19 patients. \"We\u2019re trying to work with governors to come up with a better way,\" Adams told NBC's Savannah Guthrie. He continued: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to purchase what we can for the stockpile and send it to places like New York that need it the most, but we\u2019re also trying to make sure other states and governors can get priority purchasing at a reasonable rate,\" Adams said. \"It\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re working with to try to make sure the equipment can get to where it\u2019s needed and in an efficient way and without price gouging.\u201d ##Health## Hawaii Gov. David Ige said violators of a mandatory quarantine in the state could face up to year in prison and a $5,000 fine. The mandate went into effect just after midnight in Hawaii and requires residents and visitors traveling between any of the state\u2019s islands to self-quarantine for 14 days.\u00a0 \u201cI fully understand that the ability to travel between islands is important for many residents for work, family, and medical treatment and we have been working how to allow essential travel and still protect our community,\u201d said Gov Ige at a press conference.\u00a0 The mandate requires travelers to fill out an inter-island declaration form. Essential functions, such as those traveling for medical or health care, are not subject to self-quarantine, but travelers must wear masks and follow social distancing requirements.\u00a0 \u201cIn Hawaii, we have a tradition of coming together during challenging times. This is who we are. This is what makes our island community so special and as a community it is all of our responsibility to help flatten the curve and stop the spread of Covid-19 in Hawaii,\u201d said Gov Ige.\u00a0 The state has reported 224 coronavirus cases including 1 death. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## Most members of President Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force have come to agree that Americans should begin wearing face coverings in public and could issue formal guidance soon, people familiar with the matter said.\u00a0\u00a0 Trump signaled he was open to the idea during Tuesday\u2019s briefing and members of the task force are working to draft recommendations on how to fashion the coverings to prevent spread of the virus.\u00a0 Previously, some members of the task force \u2014 including Dr. Deborah Birx \u2014 cautioned in meetings against recommending Americans wear masks because of a fear it could lull them into a false sense of protection and prevent them from socially distancing.\u00a0 But new insights into asymptomatic spread of the virus have led to a reconsideration of the guidance.\u00a0 Among the issues discussed by the task force and the CDC have been how to teach Americans to wear masks and how to prevent a rush on medical-grade equipment still in short supply for hospitals.\u00a0 There have also been discussions of the cultural shift that recommending masks would represent, since Americans \u2014 unlike citizens of some Asian countries \u2014 are not accustomed to wearing masks in public.\u00a0 There have also been discussions of whether or not to call the recommended face coverings \u201cmasks.\u201d Some have suggested referring to them simply as \u201cface coverings\u201d or \u201ccourtesy masks\u201d to distinguish them from the medical masks needed by professionals. ##Daily Life## Japan will extend an entry ban to foreign nationals from 73 countries and regions, including the US, Britain and Canada, in its latest attempt to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In a statement to CNN,\u00a010 Downing Street said highly classified government business is always held via secure systems.\u00a0 \"In the current unprecedented circumstances the need for effective channels of communication is vital.\u00a0National Cyber Security Centre guidance shows there is no security reason for Zoom not to be used for meetings of this kind,\u201d a spokesman for the Prime Minister said. \u201cZoom takes its users\u2019 privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously,\" Zoom said in a statement to CNN addressing wider security concerns around its platform.  \"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are working around-the-clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools, and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational. We appreciate the New York Attorney General\u2019s engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information.\u201d Two new viewpoint papers published in the Journal of the American Heart Association today turn a spotlight on how certain blood pressure medications may be associated with more severe Covid-19 infections \u2014 but still, it is important that patients continue taking their medications as prescribed,\u00a0they say. The papers focus on the types of drugs known as ACE inhibitors or ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs, which \"upregulate\" an enzyme called ACE2.  It turns out that the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 enters the body's cells through ACE2. Therefore there has been some speculation that heart and blood pressure medications that influence ACE2 could put patients at increased risk of severe Covid-19 infections \u2014 but until more research is conducted, doctors urge patients to keep taking their medicine. \"Taken together, ACE2 plays a protective role in both cardiovascular diseases and acute lung injury. For uninfected patients, we tend to believe it is unnecessary to discontinue ACEIs/ARBs given the lack of evidence to support the hypothesis that ACEIs/ARBs might lead to an increased risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection,\" authors Junyi Guo, Zheng Huang, Li Lin and Jiagao Lv wrote in one of the papers published Wednesday.\u00a0The authors are from\u00a0Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus pandemic began. They added that infected patients also should not discontinue their medications but there is no immediate need for an infected patient not already taking the medication to initiate use. Both papers call for more research into this issue. ##Health##\u00a0 According to CNN Health's tally of US cases that are detected and tested through US public health systems, there are\u00a0at least 186,014 cases\u00a0of coronavirus in the US.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Sanna Marin admitted things had not gone well at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, where thousands of travellers have arrived without clear instructions on how and whether or not they should self-isolate, YLE reports.\u00a0 \"Information has not flowed as it should and co-ordination has not worked as it should,\" said Marin. At the same press conference, Social Services Minister Krista Kiuru announced that testing capacity would be doubled in the near future from the current level of 2,500 tests per day, according to YLE.\u00a0 Health Minister Aino-Kaisa Pekonen said that Finland had already spent hundreds of millions of euros on acquiring protective equipment for healthcare workers, and the first consignments would arrive this week. She said there was no shortage on a national level, but noted that there were regional differences in the availability of protective kits, says YLE. This comes as the Finnish government announced Wednesday that all restaurants must be closed in the country starting Saturday, according to the Finnish government website.\u00a0 \u201cThe restrictions will remain in force until the end of May. The restrictions apply to all restaurant operations except for preparing food for take away and for delivery by food couriers.

Healthcare workers and non-hospitalized patients with complaints can now also be tested.\u201d The new policy will go into effect on April 6, and the ministry says it believes it will be capable of carrying out 17,500 tests per day by \u201cmid-April.\u201d  It added that the number of validated labs have been expanded -- from 15 to 41. Those labs will, if needed, be capable of carrying out 29,000 tests per day, due to extended working hours. The expanded testing capacity will be primarily directed towards \u201cnursing homes, care for the disabled, home care, youth care, and mental health care. General practitioners will also be able to test people in high-risk groups who display symptoms, or patients with a high need for care,\u201d the statement said.  ##Health## A large-scale study has found that early interventions, such as social distancing and severe restrictions on peoples\u2019 movement, have been critical in restraining the spread of coronavirus and have already saved tens of thousands of lives across Europe. Scientists at Imperial College London studied interventions in 11 European countries, and concluded that they\u00a0\u201chave together had a substantial impact on transmission.\u201d They estimate \u201cthat interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March.\u201d The Imperial College researchers estimate that in Italy 38,000 deaths have been averted (as of March 31 that is nearly four times the number of deaths recorded); and in Spain 16,000 \u2013 compared to a situation in which restrictions had not been introduced. In Italy\u2019s case, they say, \u201cdespite mounting pressure on health systems, interventions have averted a health care catastrophe.\u201d The researchers caution against relaxing restrictions, saying that \u201cmany more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels.\u201d And they warn, \u201cfor most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be certain that recent interventions have been effective.\u201d The Imperial College group also believes that the number of positively identified cases of coronavirus is probably much smaller than the overall rate of infection. \u201cWe estimate that there have been many more infections than are currently reported,\u201d they say, \u201cdue to the focus on testing in hospital settings rather than in the community.\u201d In Italy, their results suggest that 5.9 million people had been infected as of March 28, or 9.8% of the population. For Spain, they believe 15% of the population has been infected. The study does warn that \u201cmany interventions have occurred only recently, and their effects have not yet been fully observed due to the time lag between infection and death.\u201d Germany, for example, is estimated to have one of the lowest \"attack rates\" at 0.7%, with 600,000 people infected. But it is at an earlier stage in coronavirus spread than Spain or Italy. Across the 11 countries, the researchers estimate an average \"attack\" or infection rate of 4.9%, which they say implies \u201cthat the populations in Europe are not close to herd immunity.\u201d  But they strike a note of hope in their conclusions, saying: \u201cwe cannot say for certain that the current measures have controlled the epidemic in Europe; however, if current trends continue, there is reason for optimism.\u201d ##Health## Two medicalized high-speed trains are transferring 36 coronavirus patients from Paris to western France on Wednesday, in a bid to relieve the capital\u2019s\u00a0overburdened hospitals, the French Ministry of Health has announced.  The first of the trains, carrying 24 patients, left Austerlitz station in Paris and is headed to Saint-Brieuc and Brest in Brittany, a region less affected by the coronavirus epidemic.

The pilgrimage is not cancelled yet, but bin Taher told Muslims who are planning to attend the Hajj, set for July, to \u201cbe patient\u201d before making their bookings. If the government chooses to scrap this year\u2019s pilgrimage, it would be the first canceled Hajj in centuries.\u00a0 \"We are talking about a global pandemic and the Kingdom is completely prepared to protect the health of Muslims and citizens, therefore we have asked Muslims in countries to wait before finalizing Hajj contracts until the situation is clear,\" bin Taher told Al-Ekhbariyah channel. Earlier in March, Saudi Arabia temporarily cancelled the year-long, and smaller, Umrah pilgrimage for the first time in its modern history. Saudi Arabia\u2019s total reported number of Covid-19 infected cases stands at 1,563, with 10 coronavirus-related deaths and 165 recoveries, according to its health ministry on Tuesday. ##Travel## Austrian unemployment\u00a0numbers soared by two thirds to more than half a million people in March as the country introduced drastic restrictions on public life in an effort\u00a0to curb the spread of coronavirus.\u00a0 Austria's Public Employment Service (AMS) announced Wednesday in a statement sent to CNN that over 504,000 people in the country are currently without a job. This marked an 52.5% increase in unemployed people compared to the same month last year.  ''Austria has not seen so many people unemployed since before 1946,'' an AMS spokeswoman told CNN.\u00a0 According to the statement, the increase is particularly noticeable\u00a0in the catering and accommodation sectors, as well as in construction. It added that the transport and warehousing sectors\u00a0have also been badly affected.  ##Business## The Philippines central government has informed local police units to assist and escort all health workers to medical facilities, following reports of attacks,\u00a0according to state-run media agency Philippines News Agency (PNA). Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said threatening the safety of health workers amid the health crisis is \u201cunacceptable,\u201d at a virtual press conference on Wednesday. \u201cDespite all the support and love our country has shown our health workers, it is unfortunate that we have received reports that these front-liners have come under attack,\u201d Nograles said.\u00a0\u00a0 Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Archie Gamboa has directed police to provide assistance and security to health workers in the wake of attacks in the southern provinces of Cebu and Sultan Kudarat.\u00a0 \u201cThe PNP is committed to apply the full might of the law against those who dare to harm our health workers -- and will do whatever it takes to protect them from crime, violence, and any form of oppression and discrimination,\u201d Gamboa said. PNA reported that on March 27, a male nurse was reportedly splashed with chlorine while walking in Cebu City. On the same day, a front-liner in a hospital in Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat was attacked by a group of five who splattered bleach all over his face, according to PNA.\u00a0 Iran has reported 138 more coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, bringing the total death toll to 3,036, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpoor said on state television.

The vaccine is being developed by BAT biotechnology subsidiary Kentucky BioProcessing, in the United States.\u00a0 \"If testing goes well, BAT is hopeful that, with the right partners and support from government agencies, between 1 and 3 million doses of the vaccine could be manufactured per week, beginning in June,\" the statement said.\u00a0\"Tobacco plants offer the potential for faster and safer vaccine development compared to conventional methods.\" In 2014, Kentucky BioProcessing helped develop a treatment for Ebola. Spain has confirmed 102,136 cases of the virus and the biggest daily rise in coronavirus-related deaths, according to the latest data released on Wednesday by its health ministry.\u00a0 The country saw 864 coronavirus-related deaths in the past 24 hours,\u00a0pushing up the total number of deaths in the country since the outbreak began to 9,053 people.  The total active infections, however, saw a smaller increase than Tuesday -- with 3,470 more cases, making a total of 70,436. It added that 22,647 people have recovered from the virus.  A headline on the international homepage of the CNN mobile app mis-stated the number of deaths in Spain. This has now been corrected. ##Health## Andrew Jack, an actor who appeared in recent \"Star Wars\" films, died from Covid-19 complications on Tuesday morning, according to a statement from his agent. Jack, who worked primarily as a dialect coach to stars including Chris Hemsworth, died at St. Peter\u2019s Hospital, Chertsey, just outside London, his agent Jill McCullough said. Jack\u2019s wife was unable to be with him, as she is stuck in quarantine in Australia. McCullough added. \u201cShe was unable to see or talk to him at the end of his life and there is a chance a funeral may not be held,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was still working full pelt, currently coaching on the new 'Batman,'\u201d the statement reads. \u201cDialect coaching isn\u2019t just about being good at accents -- you need to make your actors feel safe and confident -- and Andrew\u2019s actors adored him.\u201d Fifteen days into the confinement period, the French police and gendarmerie -- the military police -- have done 5.8 million checks to see if people have a valid reason for being out and about, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on French TV LCI Wednesday morning.\u00a0 This comes a day after a 22-year-old was sentenced to 105 hours of community service in Paris by police for repeated failure to respect the confinement measures, says the Paris Prosecutor's Office.  The man was released from prison last September. He was fined four times on March 24 alone, and again two days later, and each time found with invalid papers during police checks. French officials say people can only walk and exercise around a one-kilometer radius from their home, for a maximum of one hour. They are also expected to handwrite a government-mandated permission slip.  Read more here.  The north London branch of Swedish homeware giant\u00a0IKEA is to become a new coronavirus testing facility for British health workers. \"We\u2019re enormously proud of\u00a0the NHS (National Health Service) and proud to be able to offer Wembley as an additional medical facility,\"\u00a0a spokesperson\u00a0said in a statement, later confirming to CNN that the new site would be available only to NHS staff. \"We have also responded to requests from intensive care units and doctors across the country by delivering tens of thousands of our disposable paper tape measures, to help them continue their amazing care for their patients,\u201d the statement continued, adding that\u00a0IKEA\u00a0has so far donated food to local hospitals, food banks and shelters\u00a0\"to provide some immediate relief\"\u00a0to those in need. The announcement comes just days after\u00a0IKEA\u00a0launched a new\u00a026 million euros ($28 million) fund to be used across 30 countries, \"prioritizing the needs of high-risk groups and those leading relief efforts\" in the fight against Covid-19. Editor's note: Devika Koppikar teaches AP Psychology and English at an international Chinese high school program in Wuxi, about 80 miles west of Shanghai. The opinions expressed here are her own. My Facebook feed bulged with post-lockdown food fantasies. Friends dreamed of a \"salted caramel milkshake\" or \"a cheeseburger topped with feta, fried egg, and avocado with sweet potato french fries.\"  But if there's anything I've learned after emerging from my own two-week quarantine in China, it's that we can't simply click our ruby slippers and return to life BC -- before\u00a0Covid-19. I'm from Woodbridge, Virginia, and I've lived in China for four years. I was traveling in Australia and New Zealand over the Chinese New Year when I heard that the coronavirus had raged through the city of Wuhan, about 500 miles west of where I live.  I got repeated notices from the US Embassy that \"recommended,\" but did not mandate, that Americans leave China. As my return date neared, many colleagues decided not to go back until the virus madness subsided. \"Any place but China is safe,\" they said. When I heard that everyone entering China must go through a mandatory, sealed quarantine I had a sense of doom. What if I needed to escape? How would I get food? Another expat who was in the middle of her own lockdown convinced me that it was manageable. \"You're in your own home with all amenities and they bring you food and other supplies as needed,\" she said. I have now been out of quarantine for almost 40 days -- and life is far from normal.\u00a0 Read the full opinion here: The French government will provide 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in vouchers for homeless people to help them survive during the country's coronavirus epidemic. French Minister of Housing Julien Denormandie announced the voucher scheme Wednesday in an interview with French newspaper Ouest-France. \u201cIt is a bit like a meal voucher,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we will distribute to homeless people who have difficulty accessing basic necessities.\u201d \u201cWe believe half of the 60,000 beneficiaries of these new service vouchers are in the greater Paris region.\u201d Denormandie said the government was working closely with civil organizations and community leaders on working out which areas have the greatest need. The new program aims to help 60,000 homeless people left without resources during the lockdown. The vouchers would provide financial assistance of US$7.68 per day per person to get access to basic necessities like food and hygiene products.\u00a0 Since the beginning of the lockdown, France has also made 5,500 hotel rooms available as temporary homeless shelter, according to government numbers.  Hong Kong has ordered the closure of all beauty parlors, clubhouses, nightclubs, karaoke rooms and mahjong centers from Wednesday as the city steps up measures to combat a second wave of coronavirus cases. The decision comes after at least four people were infected following a party at a karaoke bar in the city's Tsim Sha Tsui district. According to an official announcement published on Wednesday, these premises\u00a0will not be allowed to operate until further notice. Second wave epidemic: As of Tuesday, Hong Kong has reported 714 confirmed cases of the virus, according to a government news release. A new wave of infections began in the past two weeks from imported cases, brought by residents flying back from overseas. Last week, the city banned gatherings of more than four people in public places and ordered the closure of fitness centers and cinemas. ##Daily Life## Sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt who test negative for the coronavirus will be allowed to dock in Guam as long as they undergo a 14-day quarantine, the island's governor said. Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero said on Wednesday at a news conference that sailors will be allowed to stay in vacant Guam hotel rooms, but will need to have daily medical checks in their housing facilities. At the same news conference, Rear Adm. John Menoni, commander of Joint Region Mariana said a plan was being worked on to remove as \"many people from the Roosevelt as they can,\"\u00a0adding that ship evacuees would be transported and\u00a0managed\u00a0by military personnel only. Aircraft carrier outbreak: At least 70 sailors onboard the Roosevelt have tested positive for the coronavirus, and the ship's commander has warned that \"decisive action\" is needed to make the ship safe. \"We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2014 our Sailors,\" Capt. Brett Crozier wrote in a memo to the Navy's Pacific Fleet, three US defense officials have confirmed to CNN. Thousands of German tourists cannot fly home from New Zealand as the local government is refusing further return flights of foreigners who want to travel to their home countries due to the coronavirus crisis. According to the German foreign ministry in Berlin, this includes around ''more than 10,000 Germans.\" A statement published by the\u00a0German embassy in Wellington states that the ''New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed all embassies that the temporary ban on return flights would be extended beyond 31 March - for how long was not said.'' \nThe statement added that New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in a subsequent news conference declared\u00a0that her government is working to create\u00a0\"framework conditions'' for resuming repatriation flights, which could take ''a few days.'' In a news conference held by Ardern on Tuesday, she said:\u00a0''In terms of visitors from\u00a0overseas, we are working on how to help temporary visitors on wanting to leave New Zealand and get\u00a0back to their home countries. But this is complex work. And more difficult\u00a0because of the reduction of commercial flights out of\u00a0New Zealand. \"In the meantime, it is important for these people visiting our country to stay in self-isolation in their\u00a0current location and\u00a0keep in touch with their relevant embassy or consulate.'' ##Travel## The German government has asked the public to refrain from joking about the coronavirus on April Fool's Day today, declaring that \"Corona is no joke.\" It is usually a tradition in Western countries such as Germany for people to make up stories and pull pranks on April 1. But in a tweet Wednesday, the health ministry said: ''In the current situation, we ask you to refrain from making up stories about the coronavirus topic on April 1 of this year.'' The ministry added it was important to avoid making jokes about the virus to \"minimize the danger that the fight against the virus will be made more difficult by false information on the subject.'' Germany has more than 71,800 cases of the virus, including 775 deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. ##Daily Life## The numbers: More than 860,000\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0cases have been reported around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking figures from the World Health Organization and additional sources. Greatest test: The coronavirus pandemic is the \"greatest test\" the world has faced since the United Nations was formed in the wake of World War II, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The US: At least\u00a080% of the US population is under a stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order, according to a CNN count. There are at least\u00a0185,499 cases\u00a0of coronavirus\u00a0in the country and at least 3,834 people have died. Some 830 fatalities were reported on Tuesday alone. Even with stringent mitigation efforts, between\u00a0100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die\u00a0in the coming weeks, according to US government modeling. UK field hospital: Britain is planning to open a 4,000-bed field hospital, in what could be the biggest intensive care unit in the country, as cases continue to rise. The hospital is being built inside the ExCel Center\u00a0convention hall in London's East End. Count criteria changes:\u00a0China is now including asymptomatic cases\u00a0in its official count starting Wednesday. The move comes amid growing public concern over asymptomatic cases, of which 1,367 were under medical observation in China by the end of Tuesday. Latest from around Asia: Japan remains on the brink of an emergency as the numbers of coronavirus infections continues to increase, the country's chief cabinet secretary said.  Tokyo reported 78 new cases on Tuesday in the capital's highest single-day increase. Taiwan's economic stimulus plan to tackle the coronavirus outbreak could reach as much as $35 billion, President Tsai Ing-wen announced. Taiwan will be donating 10 million face masks to countries most in need. Companies step up: Hyundai Motor Group has provided two of its training institutes as treatment centers for coronavirus patients with mild symptoms. And Samsung, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, has sent its manufacturing experts to mask-producing firms to increase output without adding new equipment. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0finally leveled with America about the desperate reality of the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic, warning of cruel weeks to come in one of the most chilling White House moments in modern history. Even with blanket nationwide adoption of stringent mitigation efforts, between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could face death in the coming weeks in a cascading nationwide ordeal, according to modeling explained by senior members of the President's emergency task force Tuesday. It is in the nature of the presidency, that the commander-in-chief sometimes has to deliver grave news to the nation. George W. Bush had to narrate the horror of the\u00a09/11 attacks\u00a0in 2001. Ronald Reagan movingly eulogized shuttle astronauts after a\u00a01986 disaster. And John Kennedy kept his nerve to address the nation during a showdown with the\u00a0Soviet Union over Cuba\u00a0that threatened to erupt in nuclear war. But no president for many decades has had to level with his country over such a sudden impending loss of American life in a medical emergency as Trump is now being forced to do -- after apparently coming to terms about the extent of the crisis himself.

In the worst-case scenario outlined by the Washington-based financial institution, the region could suffer its sharpest downturn in more than two decades, plunging much of Asia into a prolonged recession. The bank's baseline forecast projects that regional growth could slow to 2.1% in 2020, compared to estimated growth of 5.8% in 2019. However, under its worst-case projection, the region's economy could contract by 0.5%, creating the potential for an extended crisis. In China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, the bank projected a decline in growth to 2.3% in the baseline forecast for 2020. In the worst case, China's growth would almost disappear entirely at 0.1%, down from 6.1% in 2019. Such a reduction would have profound consequences for the global economy. China is the world's second largest economy and a primary engine of global growth, meaning that any disruption to its economy will be felt worldwide. \"Significant economic pain seems unavoidable in all countries,\" said the report Read the full story here: ##Daily Life## The situation for passengers onboard the Zaandam cruise ship is becoming increasingly dire, after eight people on the vessel were confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus. The cruise ship also has 193 people who are experiencing influenza-like symptoms, the president of Holland America cruise line Orlando Ashford said in an op-ed in the Sun Sentinel newspaper. Four guests have died onboard, although the cause of their deaths is still unknown. Jennifer Allan, the daughter of Gloria and Bill Weed, two passengers aboard the Zaandam, told CNN both of her parents started to get a fever about nine to 10 days ago. Gloria and Bill are both in their seventies. \u201cSince the first person got sick, everyone has been quarantined in their cabins, and they are not allowed to leave. They have an inside cabin. They have only been able to leave it once about five days ago for 30 minutes, but other than that it's basically been solitary confinement,\u201d Allan said. \n\u201cPeople leave food outside their door so that nobody interacts with each other.\u201d Her father Bill's condition has worsened, Allan said. \u201cMy dad has developed pneumonia. He's getting worse. They need to get to land, they need to get medical attention sooner rather than later.\u201d  Gloria tells her daughter that the nights have been difficult for Bill. \u201cThe nights have really, really been rough the past few nights, so he's not functioning very well in the morning, towards the afternoon he starts to get a little bit better,\u201d Allan says. \u201cGenerally speaking, but it's really rough at night ... It's getting really scary for them right now.\" ##Travel## ##Health## Cuban officials announced Tuesday the country will suspend all international commercial flights to help combat the spread of coronavirus across the island. Foreign ships will also be required to leave the country.\u00a0 Cuba has recorded 186 cases of the novel coronavirus, with six deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The additional measures come one week after Cuba implemented a 30-day lockdown, restricting tourists and setting up strict quarantine measures for citizens returning to the country.\u00a0 Cuba will also suspend this year\u2019s May Day parade, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on national TV on Tuesday, to avoid further spread of the virus. How significant is the suspension? The annual parade has never been suspended on the communist-run island since Fidel Castro declared his socialist revolution in 1961, Cuban officials told CNN. The May Day parade features hundreds of thousands of government supporters marching in front of the island\u2019s top leadership in Havana\u2019s revolution square. ##Daily Life## ##Business## More than 42,000 people worldwide have died from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said the virus must be controlled and that the government would do \u201cwhatever is necessary\u201d to reduce the impact on the economy. He said, however, that the current situation doesn't call for the declaration of a state of emergency. Infections spike: Japan\u2019s capital Tokyo reported 78 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday in its highest single-day increase, as pressure to lock down the city builds.\u00a0 The latest rise in people testing positive in Tokyo came as Japan recorded over 200 new coronavirus cases on the same day -- the biggest single-day jump so far, according to public broadcaster NHK.  Declaration of emergency: On Tuesday, Koike urged Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to use Tokyo as a reference to decide whether to declare a state of emergency to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, NHK reported.\u00a0 \u201cTokyo is on the verge of an explosive increase of infections. We are trying to prevent that situation and trying to prevent further spread (of the virus). A decision by the state is needed now,\u201d Koike told reporters Tuesday.  ##Health## ##Daily Life## As Covid-19 brings the world to a halt,\u00a0some world leaders have spotted an opportunity to tighten their grip on power. In Hungary, a bill passed on Monday which\u00a0handed Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u00a0the power to rule by decree -- indefinitely. It gives him the authority to punish journalists if the government believes the reporting its not accurate and allows the government to hit citizens with heavy penalties for violating lockdown rules. It also prevents any elections or referendums from taking place while the measures are in effect. The move led to calls for the European Union to act,\u00a0with Italy's former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi,\u00a0going so far as to suggest the bloc kick Hungary out if the measures were not revoked -- something that's far easier said than done. Orban's move is perhaps the most flagrant power grab to take place during this pandemic. However, other strongman leaders have spotted the opportunity to seize greater authority.

Wyoming, in the West of the country, is the least populated state in the US and known for its natural beauty, with famous national parks such as Yellowstone. While the state has not reported any deaths, cases have risen in recent days to 120. The White House coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, urged rural communities on Monday to prepare for the spread of Covid-19, \"even though you think it's not there.\u201d These US states have reported the most fatalities: New York: 1,550\nNew Jersey: 267\nMichigan: 259\nLouisiana: 239\nWashington: 228\nCalifornia: 150 Note: The figures are according to CNN Health's tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems.

In total, 130 new asymptomatic cases were diagnosed on Tuesday, while 302 were released from quarantine.  Thirty-six new cases of the virus were recorded on Tuesday -- all but one imported. That brings the total number of imported cases to 806, according to the NHC China has recorded 81,554 cases nationwide, as of Tuesday. It is unclear if that figure includes asymptomatic cases. A total of 76,238 patients have recovered and been released from hospital, according to the NHC. Seven new deaths were reported on Tuesday, bringing the country's death toll to 3,312. Six of the new fatalities were in Hubei, where the pandemic began.

As the number of Covid-19 cases in the UK began to rise, the National Health Service (NHS) realized it might be short many thousands of ICU beds.  It hopes the solution is at a massive convention space in London\u2019s East End.  The ExCel Center is more accustomed to showcasing the latest ventilator technology than actually using it.  The coronavirus field hospital will be called NHS Nightingale, after the pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale.  \u201cOh my goodness, there is no comparison,\u201d says Natalie Forrest when asked about the hospital\u2019s scale.  She is the operational guru responsible for transforming empty halls into a functioning hospital.  When fully running, it will have 4,000 beds. At the moment, just a few dozen that CNN saw were ready.  \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want to use those beds,\u201d Forrest says.  It\u2019s staff, rather than equipment, that medical director Dr. Alan McGlennan says he\u2019s most nervous about running out of.  \u201cCritical care nurses are in very short supply,\u201d he said.  It won\u2019t be a hospital in a traditional sense. There will be no front door, no waiting rooms. \u201cWe will be receiving patients from ICUs across London,\u201d Forrest says.  \u201cSo not all types of patients -- just patients who are sedated and ventilated, and need to be cared for in an ICU.\u201d Britain has more than 25,400 coronavirus cases, with nearly 1,800 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. ##Health## Carnival Corporation is seeking at least $6 billion to weather an\u00a0unprecedented crisis\u00a0that has decimated business, after\u00a0coronavirus outbreaks\u00a0aboard its cruise ships killed several passengers and sickened hundreds more.\u00a0 The cruise operator announced on Tuesday that it intends to raise $3 billion of secured notes and $1.75 billion of convertible notes -- both due in three years -- and $1.25 billion of new shares.\u00a0 Carnival is suffering \"a monthly cash burn of approximately $500 million\" and the fresh injection of cash should keep the company afloat for the next 12 to 13 months, Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said on Tuesday.

That's the long end of the Trump administration's time window for developing a coronavirus vaccine, and some leaders in the field say this is too fast -- and could come at the expense of safety. \"I don't think it's ever been done at an industrial scale in 18 months,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar focused on emerging infectious disease at the\u00a0Center for Health Security\u00a0at Johns Hopkins University. \"Vaccine development is usually measured in years, not months.\" Vaccine trials typically start with testing in animals before launching into a three-phase process. Mark Feinberg, president and CEO of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, told Stat that while he recognizes the importance of animal trials, the urgency of the current public emergency makes it worth the trade-off. \"When you hear predictions about it taking at best a year or a year and a half to have a vaccine available ... there's no way to come close to those timelines unless we take new approaches,\"\u00a0he told the health news website, which is produced by Boston Globe Media.

I\u2019m worried by what tomorrow\u2019s figure could show,\u201d said Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike in a news conference.\u00a0 On Tuesday, Koike urged Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to use Tokyo as a reference to decide whether to declare a state of emergency to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, NHK reported.\u00a0 \u201cTokyo is on the verge of an explosive increase of infections. We are trying to prevent that situation and trying to prevent further spread (of the virus). A decision by the state is needed now,\u201d Koike told reporters Tuesday.\u00a0 Lockdown measures: Last Wednesday, Koike urged residents in Tokyo to avoid bars, restaurants and large public gatherings, and telework where possible until April 12.\u00a0 Koike\u2019s remarks were a test for the city of over roughly\u00a013.5 million people, which until then had been reluctant to impose a lockdown on its residents.

J.B. Pritzker\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Tuesday that the federal government isn\u2019t meeting the needs of his state for ventilators for Covid-19 patients and that the state is purchasing its own. The governor said the state has requested 4,000 additional ventilators from the federal government, but only received 450. \"I'm purchasing every ventilator that I can find,\" Pritzker said. \"But we're buying them in 100 lots and 200 lots, frankly, I'm taking them 50, 20, 10, wherever I can get them.\"\n\"We are going to run out of ventilators and the federal government really isn't helping at all,\" Pritzker said. Federal miscommunication over ventilators: Pritzker's comments come after the Department of Defense said it still hadn't shipped 2,000 ventilators to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health because it didn't know where to send them. \"There was discussion with (Health Department) on where to send them. And then they said: 'Hey wait, we\u2019re trying to take a look at the demand that\u2019s required,' and so we were asked to just wait while there was just some sorting through on that. And I won\u2019t speak on behalf of them, but we were in a position to provide 2,000,\" said Lt. Gen. Giovanni Tuck, the Pentagon's top logistics official, on Tuesday. ##Health## As more and more foreign passenger vessels require medical evacuations for people with flu-like symptoms, the US Coast Guard's strained local medical resources are feeling the pressure. According to a\u00a0Marine Safety Information Bulletin issued by the US Coast Guard\u00a0and obtained by CNN, the increased demand \u201cis leading to the establishment of improvised field hospitals.\u201d \u201cMedical facilities in the Port of Miami, for example are no longer accepting medevac patients due to limited hospital capacity and it is expected that neighboring counties will follow suit,\u201d the bulletin warned.

It is requesting to dock at Port Everglades. There are 305 US citizens on board, including 49 Floridians. Foreign-flagged vessels that sit beyond US territorial seas \u201cshould seek flag state support prior to seeking support from the limited facilities in the U.S,\u201d the bulletin said.  The bulletin goes on to say that an evacuee \u201chas better access to comfortable surroundings and medical staff on board the foreign passenger vessel where care is already being provided.\u201d \u201cThis is necessary as shore-side medical facilities may reach full capacity and lose the ability to accept and effectively treat additional critically-ill patients,\u201d the bulletin said. ##Daily Life## Samsung, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, has sent its manufacturing experts to mask-producing firms to increase output without adding new equipment, according to a news release from the South Korean tech giant.
