A road trip. The country music artist announced on her Instagram page that she had purchased a 2020 Airstream Globetrotter trailer to travel across the country with her husband, Brendan McLoughlin.  \"When people ask me questions about all the traveling I've done, my answer is pretty much the same every time. 'I've been everywhere but I haven't seen much of anything,'\" Lambert wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of herself and her husband next to the trailer. \"I've been touring for 19 years and most times we just roll in, play our show, and roll to the next town.
