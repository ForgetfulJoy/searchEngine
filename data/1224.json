More on this: Fabio Wajngarten, the press secretary for Brazilian President\u00a0Jair Bolsonaro, tested positive for\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0on Thursday. Trump was in close physical proximity with the Wajngarten Saturday night in Florida, two people familiar tell CNN. The Brazilian press secretary attended the dinner Trump hosted at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, took a photo with the President and later stood feet away from Trump as he spoke during Kimberly Guilfoyle's birthday, the sources said. Watch: President Trump on Friday said that the threat of novel coronavirus to young, healthy Americans \"remains very low,\" but warned that \"anyone can be a carrier\" of the virus. The remarks came as he has not been tested for coronavirus despite extended contact with someone who has been diagnosed.\u00a0 \"While the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low \u2014 read a lot about this in the last two weeks \u2014 anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions, and those who are most at risk, they have not done very well,\" Trump said in the Rose Garden.\u00a0 He continued: \"Older Americans, who are \u2014 especially if they have a health problem \u2014 have not done well. We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take.\"\u00a0 Trump has previously said \"the risk to the American people remains very low\" \u2014 today, he added the \"young\" and \"healthy\" caveats.\u00a0 The White House has said repeatedly that the President is asymptomatic and will not be tested, however, as CNN has reported, officials are now weighing whether Trump, who is in the age group of those who are more likely to get seriously ill if infected, should be tested.\u00a0 Other politicians who have had similar types of contact with those who have tested positive for the virus have self-quarantined out of an abundance of caution.\u00a0 President Trump said Friday he does not currently support the House Democrats\u2019 coronavirus bill, which would among other things provide paid leave to Americans who can\u2019t go into work during the pandemic.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe just don\u2019t think they\u2019re giving enough, we don\u2019t think the Democrats are giving enough,\u201d Trump said during an appearance in the Rose Garden. \"We thought we had something, but all of a sudden they didn\u2019t agree to certain things,\u201d Trump said of Democrats.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin spoke eight times Friday as they worked to negotiate a coronavirus response all sides can support, although sticking points over the paid leave aspects of the legislation remain.\u00a0 \"They\u2019re not doing what\u2019s right for the country,\u201d Trump said. President Trump said he is experiencing no symptoms of the coronavirus despite meeting last week with a Brazilian official who tested positive for coronavirus. \"No.\u00a0We have no symptoms whatsoever,\" Trump said, in response to a question from a reporter in the Rose Garden about whether he is planning to take any\u00a0kind of precautionary measure to\u00a0protect him and his staff. He said he had a \"fantastic meeting\" with Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro whose aide tested positive for coronavirus after the meeting with Trump. Trump pointed out that Bolsonaro tested negative. Watch: President Trump was asked Friday if there were other specific measures the administration plans to undertake in response to the coronavirus. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be releasing a paper in about two hours stating quite a few other steps, very important ones,\u201d Trump said during a White House Rose Garden news conference He didn\u2019t offer more details. ##Health## President Trump said he's considering adding the UK into the list of European countries with travel restrictions to the US \u2014 and he could take others off the list. Trump\u00a0said Wednesday he was sharply restricting travel to the United States from more than two dozen European countries. This list did not include the UK, which has seen a rise in coronavirus cases since the announcement. \"We may have to\u00a0include them in the list of\u00a0countries that we will, you\u00a0could say, ban or whatever it is,\u00a0during this period of time,\" Trump said when asked why he did not include the UK on the list. \"The numbers have gone\u00a0up fairly precipitously over the\u00a0last 24 hours.\u00a0\" He continued: \"And we may be adding a couple of\u00a0others.\u00a0And we may, frankly, start\u00a0thinking about taking some off.\" ##Travel## ##Health## President Trump announced new measures aimed at easing the burden of student loans as universities and colleges across the country shut their doors, as well as measures aimed at taking advantage of low oil prices.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies, and that will be until further notice,\u201d Trump said during an appearance in the Rose Garden, noting the number of schools that have sent students home amid the growing coronavirus outbreak. The President also said he has directed the Secretary of Energy \u201cto purchase large quantities of crude oil for the US strategic reserves.\u201d Oil prices have tumbled in recent days \u2013 particularly as the demand for jet fuel has plummeted as global travel slows dramatically amid various bans on international movement. \u201cThat\u2019s something that would have not even been possible a week ago,\u201d Trump said of the large-scale purchase he was ordering the Energy Department to make. \u00a0\u201cSo we\u2019re going to fill it up, it\u2019s a good time to fill it up,\u201d he said of the strategic crude oil reserves. President Trump continues to shake hands with corporate chiefs in the Rose Garden, even as health experts warn against the practice in a bid to prevent community spread. Trump, who has come into contact with at least one person who tested positive for coronavirus, has a self-avowed dislike of shaking hands.\u00a0 But he couldn't seem to shake the habit on Friday until at last a CEO offered an elbow bump instead of a handshake. ##Health## President Trump said the emergency orders issued today will also \"confer broad new authorities\" to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.  Azar will be able to \"waive provisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospitals \u2014 all hospitals \u2014 and health care providers maximum flexibility to respond to the virus,\" he said.\u00a0 That includes waivers of some federal licensing requirements, waivers to critical access limits on numbers of beds and lengths of stays, and waivers to rules to bring additional physicians on board at certain hospitals.\u00a0 ##Health## A\u00a0source\u00a0familiar with the President's plans says Trump is declaring both a national emergency and invoking the Stafford Act.\u00a0 What this means:  The Stafford Act is what frees up the extra federal funding and allows access to the funds.\u00a0\nThe national emergency gives access to expanded authorities for the executive branch. President Trump announced that\u00a0private labs and vaccine developers will be able to provide five million coronavirus tests within a month.\u00a0 He also claimed that drive-through testing sites will be set up to make coronavirus tests available to more people and more quickly,\u00a0something that has been implemented in other countries. ##Health## Even as he announced a scaling up of testing capacity for coronavirus, President Trump said Friday he did not believe all Americans should rush to be tested. \u201cWe don't want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn\u2019t be doing it. And we don\u2019t want everybody running out and taking \u2014 only if you have certain symptoms,\" he said in the Rose Garden. Trump, who began his remarks giving himself plaudits for his response to the outbreak, still appeared to believe the spread could be limited and that not every person in the country would require access to tests. \u201cWe don\u2019t want everybody taking this test. It\u2019s totally unnecessary,\" he said. Watch: ##Health## Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0praised President Trump's emergency action on coronavirus, saying the move \"remove the constraints\" health, state and local officials have in containing the virus. \"We still have a long way to go.\u00a0There will be many more cases.\u00a0But we'll take care of that and\u00a0ultimately, as the President said,\u00a0this will end,\" he said. Fauci added: \"But what's going on here today\u00a0is going to help it to end\u00a0sooner than it would have.\" ##Health## President Trump declared a \"national emergency\" on Friday due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the action would \"open\u00a0up access to up to $50 billion,\" which he described as \"a large amount of\u00a0money for states and territories\u00a0and localities in our shared\u00a0fight against this disease.\" Trump also urged states to set up emergency operation centers immediately.

The test comes after Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, tested positive for the virus on Thursday. Bolsonaro and his team met with US President Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. The group had dinner together with President Trump and his team. The aide was seen in a photograph standing next to President Trump. White House officials were urgently assessing as-yet-unconfirmed reports Friday that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had tested positive for coronavirus after meeting with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago. The White House had said a day earlier that neither Trump nor Vice President Pence would be tested themselves, despite coming into contact with an aide to Bolsonaro who did test positive. But the calculus in the White House is changing, one official said. Aides are currently weighing whether Trump should be tested, but it was still not clear whether he will. Officials said the White House was constantly evaluating whether to test the President and take measures to prevent the virus\u2019s spread further among Trump\u2019s close confidantes, according to one senior official, who said aides are keenly aware of the optics of testing the President. Others close to the President said they believed he would eventually be tested \u2014 if he hadn't already been so \u2014 despite denials from the White House. The decision would likely be closely held. The White House did not respond on the record to a question about whether their Thursday statement that the President had not been tested still stood. The White House said on Thursday that neither Trump nor Pence had displayed any symptoms, though asymptomatic people can still spread the virus and some studies have shown symptoms can begin displaying only after five days. Trump and Bolsonaro met last Saturday at Mar-a-Lago. Some inside the White House have privately wondered why Trump isn't being tested, according to officials, who said those people believe it would be a prudent step as Trump continues to meet with people, including a meeting scheduled for later Friday with laboratory industry officials. Some of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies \u2014 including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rick Scott, Reps. Matt Gaetz, Doug Collins and Mark Meadows, his new chief of staff \u2014 have all taken precautionary self-quarantine measures after coming into contact with people who tested positive for the virus. One White House official noted Trump is always technically \"working from home\" when he's at the White House and doesn't have any public plans to leave in the next few days. Pence, meanwhile, is not going to be tested unless something changes in the coming days, according to a person familiar with the matter. He did not attend the dinner with Bolsonaro or interact closely with the press secretary, so they have been advised again by his doctor that he doesn\u2019t need it. US citizens are waving goodbye to Spain as the country declared a state of emergency and President Trump sharply restricted travel to the United States from more than two dozen European countries. After three days of quarantine measures, Madrid's public transport was deserted, main roads were traffic-free and department stores in the city center were almost empty.  Schools, libraries and theaters were closed, with even outdoor playgrounds sealed off. Sarah Nagy and Graham Owen, from Montana, told CNN they were \"thinking of leaving while we still can.\" \u201cOur parents back home think it will be the same there soon, they would like us around,\u201d they added. Courtney Seeley, a 21-year-old student from Boston, Massachusetts, who had been doing an internship in Madrid, told CNN at the airport: \u201cI was calm until the school told us we had to go home, they even bought the flights for us, they were very expensive. \"My parents are very worried, I hope to be able to come back soon and finish my internship.\" James Donoghue, 21, was studying in London and in Madrid visiting Seeley. \u201cMy school wrote to me saying we had to go back home and leave Europe so here we are trying to leave Spain,\" he said. David and Lucenda Presnall, both 71, told CNN their son had helped them change their tickets before the ban was announced, but they had heard others spending $1,400 to get out before Friday's deadline.  \u201cWe had a whole month planned in Spain, we had nine wonderful days,\" said Lucenda, from St. Louis, Missouri. \"Then we saw what is happening to Italy and thought the same would happen here. My son really wanted us to come back. \u201cIn Granada, where we were, people weren\u2019t taking precautions, that worried us.\" There have been more than 4,000 cases and 120 deaths in Spain. More than 62 countries have placed restrictions on flights from Spain, and Morocco suspended all air and sea travel to the country.\u00a0 ##Travel## There are at least\u00a01696\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to the state and local health agencies, governments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This includes presumptive positive cases that tested positive in a public health lab and are pending confirmation from the CDC, and confirmed cases that have received positive results from the CDC. President Trump just announced he'll hold a news conference about coronavirus at 3 p.m. ET today. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today he spoke to Vice President Mike Pence yesterday and told him, \u201cI think the federal government should decentralize testing,\u201d rather than trying to control it all through Washington, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration. The \u201cvolume is just too high,\u201d Cuomo said.  \u201cWe do have a crisis in testing, we\u2019re not up to scale,\u201d Cuomo said speaking at the drive through testing site in New Rochelle, New York. He suggested 500 to 1,000 labs could open overnight if the responsibility is returned back to state. There are dozens of labs in NY that could start testing tomorrow, Cuomo said He hopes the federal government takes the recommendation seriously. Cuomo has been pushing in recent days that automated tests be approved by the FDA which would significantly increase testing capacity. ##Health## A White House official tells CNN they are planning for a coronavirus briefing today.\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence's current public schedule says he will attend a meeting with industry executives at 1:30 p.m. ET and will then lead a coronavirus task force meeting in the situation room at 3:30 p.m. ET.

There is not a briefing yet on the public schedule.\u00a0 The drive-through testing facility for coronavirus in New Rochelle, New York, can handle 6 lanes and up to 200 cars a day, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today. He said its \u201cfaster, easier\u201d as well as \u201csmarter and safer\u201d especially since this doesn\u2019t expose people who would otherwise go into an office. He said officials are prioritizing people in New Rochelle \u2014 the New York City suburb which is the site of a containment zone \u2014 first as well as vulnerable populations. But people all throughout Westchester County can be served. The medical staff will take the swabs and send it to Bioreference lab, which will do the testing. ##Health## ##Daily Life## \u00a0 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has declared a 15-day state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## Boston Mayor Marty Walsh just announced that the Boston Marathon will be postponed.

The moving storage company is offering 30-day free self-storage, U-Haul said this week. \"We don't know how every student is affected. But we know they are affected,\" U-Haul President John Taylor said on the company's website. \"More and more universities are giving instructions to leave campus and go home. Students and their parents are in need of moving and storage solutions. We have the expertise and network to help, and that's exactly what we're going to do.\" Some colleges \u2014 like Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berea College and Cornell University \u2014 have asked students to vacate their on-campus housing for the rest of the semester. That's left students scrambling to find last-minute housing, storage and transportation. How this works: Students can reserve a U-Haul truck, trailer or a U-Box \u2014 a portable moving and storage container that can be stored in U-Haul warehouses \u2014 by showing the company their college IDs. Students can also get Collegeboxes, a kit of five standard-sized boxes, shipped to them for free.

Meanwhile, the\u00a0US vice president\u00a0and the\u00a0Health and Human Services secretary\u00a0said this week they don't know how many Americans have been tested. But members of both parties say\u00a0there aren't nearly enough tests\u00a0available. There are a few factors for the difference in responses, said\u00a0Dr. Rob Davidson, an emergency room doctor and executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare. \"The public health infrastructure and the response to outbreaks and the National Security Council have been gutted by this administration,\" Davidson said. Two years ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0stopped funding epidemic prevention activities\u00a0in 39 countries, including China, after the Trump administration refused to reallocate money to a program that started during the government's response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. At that time, former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said the move \"would\u00a0significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread\u00a0without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.\" Another factor involves the tests themselves \u2014 including malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability. In the first few weeks of coronavirus in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results. \"We had the ability about five weeks ago to use a WHO \u2014 World Health Organization \u2014 approved test that's been used in other countries that was available, and that was rejected so we could use a test that was developed here,\" Davidson said. After test kits were later sent across the country,\u00a0some were flawed. \"So they go back to the drawing board,\" Davidson said. \"It put us behind by about four or five weeks.\" ##Your Questions## US stocks bounced back from their worst day since \u201cBlack Monday\u201d in 1987 on Friday.

Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan posted a video of himself reciting a few lines of verse that he had \u201cdoodled.\u201d The poem talks about listening to government advice such as washing your hands regularly, staying indoors and practicing social distancing. \"They (officials) ask us to stay at home and they say, 'do not say hello without washing your hands with soap or stay at home.' Yes, we will do what you ask us to do,\u201d says Bachchan as he recites the Hindi poem for his 40.3 million followers. \u201cBig B,\u201d as he is known across India, also posted a photo of himself preparing to record a message on coronavirus for UNICEF and the Indian government.

In 2016, he starred in the courtroom drama \u201cPink,\" in which he plays a lawyer fighting for three young female victims of unwanted sexual advances in New Delhi, often considered one of the most unsafe cities for women in India.\u00a0 In 2018, he cleared more than $560,000 worth of debt owed by farmers amid an agricultural crisis that had forced many into extreme poverty. ##Daily Life## A group of first responders in Washington state, a scientist in California, a woman at an assisted living facility in Florida -- all worried because they believe they might have coronavirus but say they can't get tested. They and many others tell CNN they're suffering symptoms associated with Covid-19, and are worried they may have come into contact with someone who has the virus. They are angry and frustrated after trying to get tested, only to be turned away.  Their stories came into CNN's tip line even as Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday told CNN's morning show, \"New Day,\" that anyone with a doctor's order could get tested. \"There's no barrier ...\" Pence said. \"Make no mistake about it, we're making steady progress.\" A primary care doctor in Massachusetts said Pence's assertion that anyone with doctor's orders for testing can get it is \"totally false.\" There is strict criteria for testing: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is only approving testing for people who are critically ill, have been exposed to an infected patient, or who have recently traveled to certain heavily impacted countries outside the US. Even if a patient is approved for testing, there just aren't tests on hand to use, said the physician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"Even if the patient were around and exposed to someone coughing, sick, sneezing, I cannot give them a coronavirus test,\" the doctor said. \"We are being crippled by our department of public health and the CDC on our ability to combat this pandemic.\" Read the full story here: ##Health## Museums, theme parks and places of worship are closing down across the world, leaving usually bustling attractions eerily empty.

The decision was made after shareholders met on Friday and unanimously decided to suspend the professional game in England, the EPL said in a statement. Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said that the league wished Arsenal's head coach Mikel Arteta and Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi \"speedy recoveries,\" after they both tested positive for coronavirus.  \"In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, Government, The FA (Football Association) and EFL (English Football League) and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority,\" he added. The aim is to reschedule fixtures when it is safe to do so and further updates will be provided when appropriate, the statement said. ##Daily Life## Before there were any cases of novel coronavirus confirmed in South Korea, one of the country's biotech firms had begun preparing to make testing kits\u00a0to identify the disease. On January 16, Chun Jong-yoon, the chief executive and founder of molecular biotech company Seegene, told his team it was time to start focusing on coronavirus. That was before the virus sweeping China had been named Covid-19 and four days ahead of South Korea confirming its first case. \"Even if nobody is asking us to, we are a molecular diagnosis company. We have to prepare in advance,\" he remembered thinking at the time. Fast forward two months, and South Korea is among the world's worst affected countries, with nearly 8,000 people infected, according to the World Health Organization. But one reason why South Korea might have a higher number of infections than other countries is its aggressive approach to testing. While some nations have struggled to get\u00a0enough test kits\u00a0to diagnose suspected patients, South Korea has provided free and easy access to testing for anyone who a doctor deems needs it. To date, the country has\u00a0tested\u00a0more than 230,000 people. Part of the reason it was able to do that is the availability of test kits developed by companies like Seegene.  Read the full story of how Seegene created its test kits here.  ##Health## Kenya has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, prompting its health secretary to warn that being black is no protection against COVID-19.

Will the outbreak end during the summer? Dr. Leana Wen, the former Baltimore Health Commissioner, echoed what many experts have said at the town hall: we just don't know yet. 2. If you had the coronavirus and recovered, can you still can still transmit the disease? Just because someone who had the coronavirus is feeling better does not mean they can't spread the disease, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US's top infectious disease doctor and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"You can become infected, get\u00a0symptomatic, resolve the\u00a0symptoms, feel well, and still\u00a0share the virus.\u00a0You can go back to your normal\u00a0life when you have two\u00a0consecutive tests for the\u00a0coronavirus that are negative,\u00a0separated by 24 hours.\u00a0That is an excellent question.\u00a0Just because you feel better or\u00a0feel well does not mean you are not\u00a0sharing the virus,\" Fauci said. 3. If you get the coronavirus once, can you contract it again? The answer to that is not yet clear, according to Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization. \"Studies are ongoing now.\u00a0Across a number of countries.\u00a0We'll have to get back to you on\u00a0that,\" she said. 4. Should you travel?  Fauci said he \"certainly wouldn't get on a plane for a pleasure trip. It would have to be something that was really urgent.\" \"I'm a pretty healthy guy for 79,\" Fauci said. \"If it (the trip) had to do with the public health and I needed to do something for the public health, I might do that because I'm quite healthy. However, if it was just for fun -- no way I would do it.\"\u00a0 And here's the CDC's latest coronavirus advice for travelers 5. What does the Trump administration's latest travel ban mean for me? The restrictions will ban travel to the US from 26 European countries -- a group in Europe called the Schengen Area -- Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\u00a0 The ban will be in effect for anyone who is transiting through the listed countries, not just arriving from them, according to CNN correspondent Richard Quest -- meaning, for instance, someone in Paris could not travel to London and then go to the US. The ban does not apply to US citizens in Europe. They are allowed to return, but the procedure is not exactly clear. They will need to go to designated airports to fly back. It's unclear whether they will have to immediately self-isolate once they arrive, or whether that may only apply to symptomatic people. ##Your Questions## ##Health## ##Travel## ##Daily Life## WATCH: The next three tournaments on the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LGPA) Tour -- including the first women\u2019s golf major of the year -- have been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The LPGA is the American organization for female professional golfers. The Founders Cup in Arizona, the Kia Classic and the ANA Inspiration in California \u2013 which were due to take place in March and early April \u2013 have been suspended.

I am fully committed to rescheduling these important events on our 2020 schedule, especially our first major, the ANA Inspiration,\u201d said LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan. Men's tournaments have also been postponed: The men\u2019s PGA Players Championship in Florida was canceled after one round, with organizers saying it was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d during the coronavirus outbreak. The event is not a major championship but is often referenced as \u201cThe Fifth Major\u201d given its status in the golfing calendar.

Races in Sanya, China and Rome had already been postponed, while Indonesian capital Jakarta delayed a race scheduled for June 6 over concerns about the virus. \u201cThis decision has not been taken lightly, but we feel it is an essential one to protect the health and well-being of staff, teams, partners and suppliers - as well as their families - who travel together with Formula E,\"\u00a0 said a Formula E statement.\u00a0\n\"As an international events-based series that races in the heart of city-centres, we also have a moral and social responsibility to protect the people and citizens in the locations we race and we do not want to exacerbate the already concerning situation.\u201d Formula E said it would remain under \u201cred flag\u201d conditions in March and April, meaning that the Paris race on April 18 would also be postponed. Then, it would move to a \"yellow flag\" in May, meaning the Seoul race on May 3 would also have to be postponed while keeping the option open to rearrange races later that month. It said it hoped to host races in June and July and potentially add additional rounds depending on the situation. Formula One cancelation: The Formula E announcement comes after Formula One's season was thrown into turmoil earlier today, with the cancelation of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. The race was canceled after a McLaren team member tested positive in Melbourne. ##Business## As America effectively shuts down, failures over\u00a0coronavirus testing kits\u00a0and\u00a0President Donald Trump's\u00a0disastrous bid to calm the markets are coming to symbolize a federal government that increasingly seems outmatched by\u00a0the global pandemic. Shuttered sports leagues,\u00a0darkened Broadway theaters,\u00a0mass school closures, packed grocery stores, shrinking 401(k)s amid a\u00a0stock market meltdown, and emptying cities hint at social disruption perhaps not seen since World War II. How bad is the outbreak? The\u00a0administration's public health experts have no idea\u00a0how bad the\u00a0US coronavirus outbreak\u00a0will get, since bottlenecks in lab testing and faults with diagnosis kits mean they can't know how many infections there really are. \"We are flying blind,\" warned Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, one of many lawmakers of both parties who\u00a0emerged furious from a Capitol Hill briefing Thursday with government officials about the situation. A source inside the meeting told CNN that lawmakers were told that only 11,000 tests had been conducted, prompting many to ask why South Korea can manage to test 10,000 in a single day. Contradictions on testing The administration has been boasting for several weeks that it is sending millions of testing kits to states and local authorities. But those officials say long waits for kits and issues with the reagent used in diagnosis mean they are able to test only the most high-risk patients. They are left in the dark about the true extent of the coronavirus' spread through the community. But after his European travel ban announced in an Oval Office address\u00a0on Wednesday night and mix-ups in his speech over how much virus treatment will cost, Trump stuck to happy talk and falsehoods. \"Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth. If you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The President's comments\u00a0contradicted his own government's head of infectious disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who admitted on Thursday that protocols under which doctors request tests for patients were not working. \"The system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now,\" Fauci said. \"It is a failing. Let's admit it.\" Read the full analysis here.  Several sporting events in Australia will proceed behind closed doors, with other public events being canceled as the country deals with the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 In a statement released on Friday, the National Rugby League said that the first round of the Premiership \"will proceed but the second round will be played behind closed doors,\" in accordance with the advice from Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier today to cancel public gatherings of more than 500 people. The Australian Football League released a similar statement today, announcing that from March 14 onwards, \"matches will only host players, coaches essential club officials, umpires, AFL officials, broadcast teams, media and required venue staff with no supports permitted to attend.\" The Sydney Royal Easter Show, a large annual agricultural show that boasts an amusement park, was also canceled on Friday due to \"increased public concern\" and \"to protect the health of stakeholders and visitors.\"  The last time the Royal Easter Show was canceled was in 1919 during the Spanish flu pandemic, according to the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales.\u00a0 Cases and deaths: As of today, there were 156 cases of the novel coronavirus in Australia, according to the Department of Health -- more than double the number from last week. The death toll remains at three. ##Daily Life## ##Business## Latest numbers: There are now more than 132,500 cases of the coronavirus and nearly 5,000 deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Over 68,000 patients have recovered globally, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. European markets opened higher: European shares have opened higher today after yesterday's huge losses. The main markets in Europe were all up, with the FTSE 100 up more than 6%, the French CAC 40 up 4% and the German Dax gained more than 3%. Infection rate in hard-hit Asian continues to slow: Mainland China reported only eight new infections Thursday, with five in Wuhan, ground zero for the pandemic. China has reported 80,813 cases and 3,176 deaths since the outbreak began last December. More than 64,000 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital. South Korea, which is home to the second-biggest outbreak in East Asia, only reported\u00a0110 new cases on Wednesday -- the lowest daily increase since February 22.  Meanwhile, India reported a first coronavirus-related death today, and Hong Kong recorded its fourth. Australia takes big steps: Australian Minister Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced today the government now advises against mass gatherings of more than 500 people. Several sporting events in the country will go ahead behind closed doors. Australia has identified more than 150 coronavirus cases, including Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and celebrity couple Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. Coronavirus fallout continues in US: Daily life in the United States has been turned upside down as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic.  The effects now go beyond Wall Street and travel. Schools are shutting and businesses are asking employees to work from home. Mass gatherings are being called off. Sports leagues have suspended operations. Stores in some parts of the country are running low on certain goods. The novel coronavirus is, essentially, putting America on hold. As of the end of the day Thursday, there were 1,665 cases in the US. Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia have all reported infections. Forty-one people have died. Canada's first lady tests positive:\u00a0Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, tested positive for coronavirus, according to a statement from Trudeau\u2019s office. She is feeling well, only has mild symptoms, and will remain in isolation, the statement said. There are now 132,567 cases of the coronavirus worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The global death toll is nearing 5,000, standing at 4,947 fatalities. The majority of cases are still in China, which has reported 80,981\u00a0infections, according to the WHO. Italy is next with more than 15,000 cases, and Iran third with more than 10,000 cases. At least 64,000 patients have recovered from the virus and been discharged from hospital, according to China's National Health Commission. Johns Hopkins University estimates the global number of recovered cases is more than 68,000. ##Health## European shares have opened higher today after yesterday's huge losses. The main markets in Europe were all up, with the FTSE 100 up more than 6%, the French CAC 40 up 4% and the German Dax gained more than 3%. In Italy, the FTSEMIB opened 2% higher after falling nearly 17% on Thursday. Regulators in Italy have banned short selling on stocks amid the market turmoil. Some context: The latest rout began after President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a\u00a030-day ban on travel\u00a0from most of Europe, which further fanned fears about economic disruptions, particularly for the travel industry. The broader markets were hammered by coronavirus fears, even as policymakers tried to cushion the blow from the crisis. The S&P 500\u00a0entered a bear market on\u00a0yesterday during its worst performance since \"Black Monday\" on October 19, 1987. All three major Wall Street indexes are now in a bear market, and\u00a0European stocks suffered their worst day on record. ##Business## Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Michigan and New Mexico have become the first US states to shut all K-12 schools over coronavirus concerns. Washington may be next; Gov. Jay Inslee told school districts across the state to prepare to close, while some large school districts have already shut. In Maryland, all schools will close for two weeks, from March 16-27. In Ohio, all schools -- including public, private, and, charter -- will close from March 16 through at least April 3, a closure that impacts\u00a01.66 million students. In Kentucky, all public and private schools are suspending in-person classes starting March 16, for at least two weeks. If approved by the state's education department, school districts may use \u201cnon-traditional instruction\u201d instead, like remote learning. In New Mexico, all public elementary and secondary schools will close starting March 16, for three weeks. In Michigan, all K-12 schools will be closed from March 16 through April 6. It's not just states -- many cities have also decided to close entire school districts, including San Francisco, Denver, Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Seattle, and New Rochelle in New York\u00a0state. ##Daily Life## As\u00a0the coronavirus\u00a0began spreading around the world this year, one common refrain from skeptics was that it was just like the flu -- dangerous to sensitive groups but routine and not something to get into lockdown over. We now know that assessment is wrong. At its lowest estimated fatality rate based on current data, Covid-19 is\u00a0thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients, compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza, and it appears to be about as infectious as the flu, if not more so. There is one area in which experts hope the virus will still behave like influenza, however, by tapering off in spring. Warm weather slows the flu: Influenza\u00a0thrives in cold and dry conditions, and behavioral differences in winter can also have an effect.  Nelson Michael, a leading US military medical researcher, predicted the coronavirus may behave like the flu and give us \"less trouble as the weather warms up,\" but, he cautioned, it could come back when the weather gets cold again. But warm countries around the world still have outbreaks. More than 100 cases have been confirmed in Singapore, where it's hot and muggy pretty much year round. Australia, Brazil and Argentina, all currently in the middle of summer, have also reported dozens of cases. And some of the worst hit areas around the world -- from Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, to Iran, Italy and South Korea --\u00a0are on more or less the same latitude, with similar temperatures and relative humidity A variety of other factors also affect how this pandemic will play out, making influenza an inexact comparison -- for instance, the infectiousness of the virus and behaviors to reduce its spread. \"We are not dealing with a virus like influenza that behaves predictably every year,\" said Debra Chew, an assistant professor of medicine at Rutgers.New Jersey Medical School.

According to Ctrip, China\u2019s leading travel site, about 25% of the China-based attractions on its platform have begun receiving visitors again. These attractions include the Top of\u00a0Shanghai Observatory at Shanghai Tower -- the tallest building in China -- and the Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower observation deck, both of which reopened doors to tourists on Thursday. Visitors to both towers are required to wear face masks and will have their temperatures taken at the door. They must also show their personal color-coded mobile QR code -- a system recently implemented by China to monitor citizens\u2019 quarantine status -- before entering. ##Travel## A staffer from the Philippine Mission to the United Nations who tested positive for\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0met two delegates from another mission at the UN on Monday. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed the meeting in a statement Thursday, saying that UN medical services officials are reaching out to the two delegates. The individual did not have contact with UN staff, he said. \"The delegate was last in UN headquarters on March 9 for about 30 minutes around mid-day and visited only one meeting room, which has gone through three cleaning cycles since then,\" the statement said.\u00a0\n\"The delegate did not have contact with UN staff but met two delegates from another mission. UN Medical services is reaching out to them.\" Acting Philippine Ambassador to the UN Kira Azucena said in a letter that the staffer was asymptomatic during the visit. The next day, she had flu like symptoms and did not go to work, according to the letter. She saw her doctor, tested positive for the flu and was prescribed Tamiflu. She tested positive for the coronavirus Thursday, according to the letter. The Philippine Mission is in lockdown, and all personnel are instructed to self-quarantine and to seek medical attention should they develop the symptoms.\u00a0 \"We are assuming that all of us have been infected,\" Azucena said. ##Travel## An employee of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Washington metro area is\u00a0suspected to have coronavirus\u00a0and is showing symptoms, intelligence officials told CNN on Thursday. The employee doesn't work at agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, in the Washington suburbs, but does work in the area and the individual's condition is not a result of CIA-related travel. People this person came into contact with were notified\u00a0and deep cleaning took place where they work. There's been no impact so far at CIA headquarters. A workforce email said all non-mission-critical domestic US travel is postponed until further notice; all ceremonies, internal events and conferences canceled or postponed until further notice but some waivers are possible; and all non-mission-critical visits to agency facilities in the Washington metro area are postponed through April 10. \"CIA's first priority is the safety of our officers, and we continue to enact measures consistent with CDC guidelines and our mission to protect the health and well-being of our global workforce,\" said CIA spokesperson Tim Barrett. ##Health## South Korea\u2019s coronavirus cases continue to slow, with the country reporting\u00a0110 new infections on Wednesday -- the lowest daily increase since February 22. The national total now stands at 7,979, according to the South Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The KCDC also confirmed one additional death, bringing the national death toll to 67. The southern city of Daegu, which lies at the heart of the national outbreak, also saw its lowest daily increase since February 23. Some\u00a061 of Wednesday's new cases came from Daegu. Nearly 90% of all cases nationwide are from Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang province. Signs of slowdown: The country's health minister told CNN earlier this week that he hopes the recent slowdown in cases meant they had \"passed the peak\" of the outbreak. The country saw its cases skyrocket in February, with most cases linked to a religious group based in Daegu -- but the past month has also seen widespread, aggressive testing  that experts credit for South Korea's success in early detection and containment. ##Health## Australia's Minister for Home Affairs has confirmed that he tested positive for the novel coronavirus. In a statement released today, minister Peter Dutton said that he woke up this morning \"with a temperature and sore throat\" and was \"subsequently tested for COVID-19.\"  Dutton was advised by Queensland Health that his tests returned positive this afternoon.\u00a0 Under the policy of Queensland Health, \"anyone who tests positive is to be admitted into hospital and I have complied with their advice,\" Dutton said. He added that \"I feel fine and will provide an update in due course.\" ##Health## China continues to report a drop in daily cases and a lower death toll from the novel coronavirus, with the latest tallies for both categories in single digits. Seven more people died in mainland China yesterday, according to the country's National Health Commission (NHC). There were eight new confirmed cases, five of which were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic. The drop in new daily cases is especially striking given that just a month or two ago, the country was reporting thousands of new cases per day. Total cases: China has reported 80,813 cases and 3,176 deaths since the outbreak began last December. Total recoveries: 64,111 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the NHC. ##Health## All land, sea, and air transport will be suspended in the Metro Manila region from Sunday through April 14,\u00a0Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said in an address to the country yesterday. Metro Manila, also known as the National Capital Region, is home to 12.8 million people across 16 cities. Duterte said the\u00a0Philippine\u00a0National Police\u00a0and military will work with a coronavirus task force to implement the restrictions, adding that these measures do not constitute martial law. He also called for neighborhoods to go into quarantine when cases are confirmed. Duterte added that public transportation would remain operational but social distancing must be enforced, according to state-run Philippine\u00a0New Agency. The country has 52 confirmed cases, according to the World Health Organziation, most of which were reported in the past week. Duterte is being tested: The President is also undergoing testing, after some cabinet members were exposed to infected patients, according to a Facebook post by presidential aide Bong Go. ##Health## ##Travel## Nepal has decided to cancel all expeditions to Mount Everest for the rest of the climbing season due to the coronavirus outbreak, Tourism Secretary Kedar Bahadur Adhikari said today. \"Expeditions to Mount Everest have been closed with immediate effect. Climbing permits are cancelled till the end of April,\" Adhikari said. Why this matters: This time of year -- the spring months of March, April, and May -- are among the most popular times to climb Mount Everest. Hundreds flock to the mountain during the best few weeks of the season, when the weather is good and temperatures are warmer. The economic blow: This cancelation could also serve a huge blow to Nepal's already weak economy. Tourism is one of the mainstays of the country's economy, and some people -- particularly in rural areas -- depend on it as their primary source of income. According to the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, one job is generated by every six tourist visits, and 138,000 people are employed in the sector. Everest is a major source of income, given that foreign climbers can spend up to $100,000 for a chance to climb the mountain, with much of the money going to local tour companies and guides. ##Travel## As the coronavirus continues to pop up\u00a0in most US states, what do you do if your neighbor, or someone in your community, gets struck with the virus? First of all, don't panic. Fear-mongering can make people susceptible to misinformation and panic-buying -- which doesn't help anyone. Listen to local health departments and the CDC, and stay informed. \"If a resident is confirmed to have or is believed to have 2019-nCoV, do not direct facilities management or maintenance staff to the apartment,\" said the National Apartment Association\u00a0in a statement. Instead, notify your local health department and the CDC. Keep practicing preventive basics. Things like\u00a0washing your hands\u00a0and covering coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue can go a long way. Hand sanitizer\u00a0with at least 60% alcohol\u00a0can be used as a substitute. People should also clean frequently touched surfaces. You may want to avoid poorly ventilated buildings, even if it's\u00a0your own building -- it can raise the risk of infection. Try to work from home and avoid crowded public places. The CDC recommends staying home if an outbreak occurs in your community, and that means working from home and avoiding popular areas. You don't have to cut yourself off from public life, but vigilance is key.  Stock up on groceries and toiletries: Keep enough groceries, toiletries, and food and water to last you a little while. Think things like toothpaste, detergent, and water filters. Self-isolating doesn't mean zero contact. You can stay in touch with people over phone or email -- long-term isolation can actually be damaging, and zero social contact isn't a solution.

Apple and Starbucks have also temporarily suspended operations at some China stores recently, while Italy has ordered all shops across the country to shut down, apart from supermarkets and pharmacies. ##Business## Here's a recap of major news that broke within the past few hours:  Australia's advises against mass gatherings of more than 500 people: Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision was made \"based on the advice we have received today about the increasing number of cases and the evidence of community transmissions,\" and will come into effect Monday. Australia has identified more than 140 coronavirus cases, Morrison said yesterday, and is an important test case as to whether warmer weather will help stop the virus from spreading.  Canada's first lady tests positive: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, tested positive for coronavirus, according to a statement from Trudeau\u2019s office. She is feeling well, only has mild symptoms, and will remain in isolation, the statement said. The Prime Minister has no symptoms but will be in isolation for 14 days, according to the statement. He is not being tested at this time because he is asymptomatic, and will continue his duties as normal.  Here's what Trudeau said on Twitter: The impact on the sports world grows: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league's hiatus due to the coronavirus\u00a0\u201cwill most likely be at least 30 days\" and did not rule out the possibility of the season being canceled. US Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League followed the NBA's lead and suspended play, while Major League Baseball has pushed back the start of its season. And the PGA Tour announced late Thursday night that it is canceling The Players Championship taking place this week in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida and other events through April 2. Formula 1 has also canceled the\u00a0Australian Grand Prix after a McLaren team member tested positive. In Europe, Callum Hudson-Odoi of the English Premier League soccer club Chelsea has tested positive for coronavirus, the team announced on Thursday. Arsenal announced that manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for coronavirus earlier in the day.  The English Premier League is set to hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss future matches.\u00a0 This post was updated to reflect that the Australian government is advising against mass gatherings. ##Health## ##Business## ##Travel## ##Daily Life## India reported its first death from the coronavirus earlier today -- a 76-year-old man with preexisting conditions who had visited Saudi Arabia. He died on Tuesday in\u00a0the southwestern state of Karnataka. India has 74 cases of the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. The country is now enforcing additional measures to contain the virus. The Presidential Palace will be closed to tour visits, and the change of guard ceremony will also be closed to the public until further notice. Foreign nationals arriving from Sri Lanka, South Korea, Italy, and Iran will be sent to quarantine centers for a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Earlier in the week, the country also announced it would suspend all tourist visas to halt the virus spreading further. Visas for special purposes like diplomatic visas and those for UN or international organizations will be exempt. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Travel## There are big panics like\u00a0the sell-off on Wall Street. There are little panics, like stores being cleaned out of toilet paper. But everywhere, there seems to suddenly be panic.  Travel is canceled.\u00a0Schools are canceled.\u00a0Broadway is canceled.\u00a0Basketball is canceled.\u00a0Disneyland is canceled. The pandemic undercuts the entire system on which modern society is based. It highlights ways the system has failed. Trump's new Europe travel restrictions came too late for state and local governments, private companies and health officials dealing with a disease that's already here -- and for which the US is not currently able to test like other countries. You can't just go out and get a test if you develop a cough. It is perhaps the most pressing issue facing the country, but it went unmentioned by Trump in his address Wednesday night. Lawmakers from both parties fumed after being briefed Thursday on Capitol Hill.\u00a0\"Our system has just not been up to snuff and I think a lot of people are frustrated by it,\" said Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. \"I'm one of them.\" And it's a stress test for the nation. The virus threatens to test the capacity of the US health system, but it is already straining the economy and the social system. The stock market\u00a0plunged again\u00a0and trading was briefly halted Thursday. The New York Federal Reserve announced extraordinary measures to open access to $1 trillion in capital. The travel industry in particular was in chaos as airlines and cruise companies struggled from the shock of new travel restrictions on top of cascading cancellations.

The measures will come into effect on Monday. \"Based on the advice we have received today about the increasing number of cases and the evidence of community transmissions, it has been recommended to us that we move to a position by Monday where we will be advising against organized, non-essential gatherings of persons of more than 500 people or greater more,\" Morrison said. Australia has 140 coronavirus cases, Morrison said yesterday. Even before Morrison's announcement, many events were already beginning to be canceled. Formula 1 canceled the\u00a0Australian Grand Prix after a racer tested positive, and the movie Tom Hanks was filming in the country has been suspended after he and his wife both tested positive. This post was updated to reflect that the Australian government is advising against mass gatherings. ##Daily Life## Formula One\u2019s Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne has been canceled amid growing fears over the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0 The decision to cancel the season opener was made unanimously by the Australian Grand Prix organizers, Formula One and the FIA, the motorsport's governing body. \u201cOur first priority is the safety of everyone including attendees, our personnel, all event partners and members of the local community,\u201d organizers said in a statement released Friday, just a few hours ahead of the first practice session.\u00a0 Infected team member: The cancelations came after a McLaren Racing team member tested positive for the virus Thursday night, prompting McLaren to pull out of the race. A further seven people tested negative for the coronavirus. A ninth person -- who is not associated with any Formula One team, the FIA or associated suppliers -- has also been assessed and tested for the coronavirus. The results are pending.\u00a0 During a packed news conference Thursday, six-time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton criticized Formula One and the FIA\u2019s handling of the situation.\u00a0 \u201cI am really very, very surprised that we\u2019re here. I think motorsport is\u2026 I think it\u2019s great that we have races but for me it\u2019s shocking that we\u2019re all sitting in this room,\u201d said Hamilton. Information on refunds for ticket holders is expected to follow in due course.\u00a0 ##Business## President Donald Trump has become the first world leader to suggest postponing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics as the coronavirus pandemic spreads.  \"This is just my idea \u2026 Maybe they postpone it for a year,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, 134 days before the opening ceremony is scheduled to take place in Tokyo's Olympic Stadium.\u00a0 Trump added that delaying the Olympics by a year would be a better option than holding it with no crowds.\u00a0However, he said he would not relay the message to Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, according to Japan\u2019s public broadcaster NHK. The pair held telephone talks Friday Japan local time.\u00a0\u00a0 In response to Trump\u2019s comments, Japan\u2019s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, stressed the preparations for a \u201csafe and secure\u201d Games was still underway.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m aware of President Trump\u2019s remarks, however, neither the IOC nor the organizing committee has considered any postponement or cancellation of the Games,\" she said. Trump\u2019s latest comments came as the Olympic flame lighting ceremony kicked off in Greece Thursday, and as International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said Tokyo 2020 would go ahead as planned. ##Business## Stephen Colbert's late-night talk show is slated to go on tonight without a studio audience, but will be canceled next week, the comedian said on Twitter. Here's what he said: ##Business## Callum Hudson-Odoi of the English Premier League soccer club Chelsea has tested positive for coronavirus, the team announced on Thursday. The 19-year-old player is the latest soccer figure to test positive for the virus. The English Premier League is set to hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss future matches.\u00a0 Chelsea said in a club statement that personnel who had recent close contact with the player will now self-isolate. Earlier Thursday, Arsenal football club announced that manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for coronavirus. The English Premier League previously said that this weekend\u2019s fixtures will go ahead as planned. Football leagues in Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United States have all been suspended amid the outbreak, while the German Bundesliga and France\u2019s Ligue 1 are holding matches behind closed doors. CNN wrapped up its coronavirus town hall tonight with one final question, that is likely on the minds of many Americans: How worried should I actually be? This isn't the end of the world, said CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"The water is not going to shut\u00a0down.\u00a0The electricity is not going to\u00a0go off.\u00a0The grid is not going to go offline.\" Unfortunately, people will get sick, and some will die, he warned. But \"the vast majority will recover.\" And though we don't yet have an available vaccine, we have determined the necessary effective measures, like quarantine, contact tracing, and social distancing. Already, at least 62,000 people have recovered fully from the illness. \"It's going to be\u00a0unpleasant, uncomfortable,\u00a0difficult, but it is not an\u00a0alien life form coming from\u00a0another planet that is going to\u00a0destroy the universe.\u00a0It is something that is\u00a0manageable and doctors know how\u00a0to deal with it.\u00a0It's going to be tough, but\u00a0we'll get through that,\" Cooper said. And as we've learned from Asia, it's important not to panic. The most important things you can do are be informed, follow officials' advice, take the necessary precautions like avoiding crowded areas and washing your hands often, and notify your local authorities if you notice symptoms.  Coronavirus patient Carl Goldman is still testing positive for coronavirus about one month after contracting it, he told Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Thursday during CNN\u2019s Global Town Hall, \u201cCoronavirus: Facts and Fears.\u201d Goldman said he last tested positive on Thursday, meaning he would remain in isolation in Omaha, Nebraska, for the coming days while health officials continue to take samples. \"I'm not the only one,\" he said. \"There's a bunch of us from the Diamond Princess ... that are still in the same boat I'm in.\" A retrospective\u00a0study\u00a0published Wednesday in medical journal The Lancet found that, among nearly 200 hospitalized coronavirus patients in China, viral shedding ranged from eight to 37 days among survivors, with a median of 20 days. ##Health## Aside from washing your hands regularly, there is a lot more people should be doing to take care of themselves as coronavirus creeps into every facet of society. This advice was shared by Dr. Christine Moutier, a psychiatrist, during CNN's coronavirus town hall. \"When we look at the data\u00a0and actually past events, what we\u00a0see is that during time of\u00a0stress, even wartime or natural\u00a0disasters, we tend to come\u00a0together and that can introduce\u00a0a protective effect,\" Moutier said. \"Because this has this social\u00a0distancing piece and the\u00a0infectious disease contagion\u00a0piece to it, I think we have to\u00a0think thoughtfully about are we\u00a0connecting with our loved ones?\u00a0Are we checking in?\u00a0Are we using technology if we\u00a0need to?\u00a0This is a time we can use that\u00a0for good.\" ##Your Questions## ##Health## Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority confirmed that a coronavirus patient died on Friday morning, the fourth fatality in the city related to the global pandemic.\u00a0 As of Friday, the citywide total number of cases is 131, the Hospital Authority said. At CNN's coronavirus town hall, one viewer brought up the Life Care Center \u2014 the nursing home in Washington state at the heart of the outbreak there. So far, 22 deaths in Washington state are associated with the nursing home. There are still 26 other infected residents living there. Twelve residents have tested negative, while nine more have results that are either pending or inconclusive. \"Why hasn't the Life Care Center\u00a0in Washington been evacuated?\" one viewer asked. \"Shouldn't the staff be\u00a0self-quarantining? The government is leaving these\u00a0people to die.\" CNN National Correspondent Sara Sidner weighed in from Kirkland, Washington: \"The number one the reason this\u00a0nursing facility didn't evacuate\u00a0and just move patients out and get\u00a0rid of the staff, was that\u00a0there was no one that was\u00a0willing to take these patients,\" Sidner said.\u00a0 Hospitals didn't want to take patients unless they had very acute, life-threatening symptoms, because of the risk they could infect other patients who are already sick in the hospital, Sidner said. And the residents' families often aren't in a position to care for their medical needs \u2014 that's why these residents are in a nursing home in the first place. \"And with some of the patients\u00a0testing positive for\u00a0coronavirus, they didn't want to\u00a0infect families and communities.\u00a0There was nowhere else for the\u00a0patients to go,\" Sidner said. ##Health## ##Your Questions## Organizers of Los Angeles Pride have announced that all events related to this year\u2019s 50th\u00a0anniversary of the annual festival and parade have been postponed. \u201cDue to the concerns of COVID-19, CSW will postpone all events related to the 50th Anniversary of LA Pride that were scheduled for June 2020.

Whitmer's tweets with the announcement: ##Daily Life## The verdict is still out on whether someone who contracts coronavirus can get the disease again.  This was a point made Thursday by Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization, who spoke with CNN during its coronavirus town hall. \"The answer is we don't know.\u00a0Yet.\u00a0What we are looking at and what\u00a0scientists are looking at is an\u00a0immune response to individuals\u00a0who are infected with this virus.\u00a0We don't have a robust data on\u00a0this yet,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"What could happen is that when\u00a0someone gets infected, they\u00a0develop an immune and antibody\u00a0response.\u00a0And that could provide some\u00a0protection going forward.\u00a0We don't have data to be able to\u00a0say whether this is possible or\u00a0not.\u00a0These studies are ongoing now.\u00a0Across a number of countries.\u00a0We'll have to get back to you on\u00a0that.\" Watch: ##Health## ##Your Questions## At CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall, a viewer asked: How many people worldwide have recovered from the coronavirus? The quick answer is, at least 60,000, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization (WHO) -- citing a figure from earlier in the week. It has since risen; China's National Health Commission said yesterday that 62,793 patients\u00a0had recovered and been discharged from hospital. Here's a more detailed breakdown: There are more than 125,000 cases globally, according to the WHO.  About 80% of all patients in China had a \"mild form of the disease,\" said Van Kerkhove -- meaning they may feel unwell for a week or two. About 20% will require advanced care in hospital, and may need more serious measures like respiratory support. Then, a small portion of people will die. According to a report in the\u00a0medical journal JAMA, the fatality rate in China is about 2.3%.  ##Health## ##Your Questions## Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization, said the virus was \"relatively stable\" during CNN\u2019s Global Town Hall, \u201cCoronavirus: Facts and Fears,\u201d on Thursday. \"We know that there are different groupings of these viruses,\" Van Kerkhove said in response to a question about an earlier study identifying separate strains of the coronavirus. \"There's no indication that there are differences in terms of virulence based on those different groupings.\"\u00a0 \"There are normal changes that happen in a virus over time, but this virus is relatively stable,\u201d Van Kerkhove said. ##Health## ##Your Questions## There is a balance between making sure someone with coronavirus is quarantined but does not feel completely isolated, according to Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization. Van Kerkhove addressed this nuance tonight during CNN's coronavirus town hall which was prompted by a question from Dr. Sanjay Gupta on how countries can strike a\u00a0balance between protecting\u00a0health and minimizing social\u00a0disruption and respecting human\u00a0rights. The first step, Van Kerkhove claims, is making sure all coronavirus cases are identified. The next, is simply caring for people, she said. \"Making sure they get the right\u00a0standard of care either in hospital and,\u00a0as you know, not everybody will\u00a0require hospitalization.\u00a0Some people will develop severe\u00a0disease.\u00a0It's important to get the right\u00a0care,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"Make sure contacts are isolated,\u00a0are in quarantine.\u00a0So that we remove them from other\u00a0people so they don't pass it on.\u00a0If you do that, you have to make\u00a0sure they're cared for as well.\u00a0And have the right information.\u00a0They have food and have medical\u00a0care.\u00a0That they can still reach loved ones.\u00a0There is a balance between\u00a0separating people and making\u00a0sure we don't pass the virus\u00a0between people.\u00a0But make them feel connected\u00a0with loved ones.\" ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Your Questions## South Korea is the hardest-hit Asian country outside China -- but recently it has also become a model for the rest of the world in terms of testing, detection, and containment. \"Since this started there's been\u00a0almost a quarter of a million\u00a0people in this country that\u00a0have been tested,\" said CNN Correspondent Paula Hancocks, joining CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall from Seoul, South Korea. \"That's far more than most other\u00a0countries around the world.\u00a0Over the last week the number of\u00a0new cases every day has been\u00a0decreasing.\u00a0They have new cases but it does\u00a0appear at least at this point to\u00a0be a slow down.\" Just earlier this week, South Korea's health minister told CNN he hoped the slowdown was a sign that the country has passed the peak of the outbreak. Some lessons we can take from South Korea: Early detection: Widespread, fast, accessible testing is key -- South Korea has drive-through testing sites, and runs thousands of tests a day. That allows health authorities to detect and isolate patients quickly, and conduct contact tracing, before the virus can be further transmitted.\nAllocate medical resources well: Not every patient will need hospitalization -- only about 10% of South Korean cases actually stayed in the hospital.\nCitizens need to take responsibility: It's not just up to government and health authorities to contain the virus -- we all have a responsibility in this. \"No matter\u00a0how efficient the health system\u00a0in the country and how quick the\u00a0government is to react, it is\u00a0key that citizens are honest and\u00a0cooperating,\" Hancocks said. ##Health## There are at least\u00a01,645\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to state and local health agencies, governments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This includes presumptive positive cases that tested positive in a public health lab and are pending confirmation from the CDC, and confirmed cases that have received positive results from the CDC. According to the CDC, there are 70 coronavirus cases involving citizens repatriated from abroad and from aboard cruise ships. According to CNN Health\u2019s tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems, there are\u00a01,575\u00a0cases in\u00a047\u00a0states and the District of Columbia. To date,\u00a041\u00a0people have died.\u00a0 Here's a state-by-state breakdown: CNN's Richard Quest, reporting from London, joins CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall to discuss the new travel restrictions President Donald Trump announced yesterday. The restrictions will ban travel to the US from 26 European countries -- a group in Europe called the Schengen Area. The United Kingdom is not part of this group. These are the 26 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\u00a0 There's no \"back door\": The ban will be in effect for anyone who is transiting through the listed countries, not just arriving from them, said Quest -- meaning, for instance, someone in Paris could not travel to London and then go to the US. \"You will risk making an error,\u00a0making a telling a false\u00a0statement to immigration and\u00a0that has serious consequences,\" Quest warned. US citizens in Europe are allowed to fly back: But the process is still unclear at the moment. Americans currently in Europe will need to go to designated airports to fly back, but it's unclear whether they will immediately self-isolated once they arrive, or whether that may only apply to symptomatic people. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## The US's top infectious disease doctor told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta Thursday night that he wouldn't get on a plane right now due to the coronavirus outbreak unless absolutely necessary. \"I certainly wouldn't get on a plane for a pleasure trip. It would have to be something that was really urgent,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during CNN\u2019s coronavirus town hall. \"My job is the public health. If it had to do with the public health and I needed to do something for the public health, I might do that because I'm quite healthy. However, if it was just for fun \u2014 no way I would do it.\"\u00a0 \"I'm a pretty healthy guy for 79,\" Fauci added. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Your Questions## ##Travel## Former NBA player and current \"NBA on TNT\" analyst Charles Barkley confirmed on-air on Thursday that he was tested for coronavirus at the suggestion of doctors after he wasn\u2019t feeling well following a trip to New York City.  Barkley's announcement comes a day after the NBA postponed its season due to the virus. Barkley, who called into TNT's Thursday show, said that he was in his second day of self-quarantine and was awaiting the results of the test. Here's what he said: \"I went and took the coronavirus test late this afternoon.\u00a0I have not gotten the results back.\u00a0So, I'm just kind of in limbo right now. I'm really hoping it was just a bug.\u00a0Like I said I was in New York earlier this week because that was a hot spot.\u00a0And when I got to Atlanta I just wasn't feeling well.\u00a0But I took the test, I haven't gotten the results back, but that's where I'm at right now.\" ##Health## At CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall, one viewer asked whether they could make their own cleaning supplies like hand sanitizer. The answer from our panel is clear: no. \"Do not make your own sanitizer\u00a0and don't go out there and try\u00a0to become your own chemist.\u00a0Don't use vodka and recipes.\u00a0Those are not effective and\u00a0could be dangerous,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner. Soap and water will do the trick. \"It's much more effective,\" Wen said \u2014 both to clean your hands, and to clean surfaces of your home. Liquid soap is best if possible. Just remember to do it right: remember to wash commonly-neglected parts of your hands like your thumbs and fingertips, not just your palms or the back of your hands. Wash them frequently throughout the day, for 20 seconds each time. Stay conscious of the things you touch during the day and try not to rub your eyes or touch your mouth with unwashed hands. Watch: ##Your Questions## ##Health## One viewer raised the question during CNN's coronavirus town hall: Can we expect to see the virus die down in the next few months as we enter warmer summer months? Here's what Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner, had to say: \"I wish this were the case but\u00a0at this point we just don't\u00a0know,\" Wen said. It's possible \u2014 past outbreaks like SARS in 2003 peaked in March and early April as the weather warmed up. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily what will happen this time around, as there are still a lot of factors placing us at risk, like the lack of a vaccine or treatment, and the higher rate of global travel now than a decade ago. And even if it subsides in the summer, it isn't gone forever. The virus could become more prevalent in other parts of the world with different seasonal patterns, or even come back once winter arrives again next year \u2014 so \"we cannot count on warm\u00a0weather to get rid of Covid-19,\" Wen said. ##Health## ##Your Questions## Tom Hanks took to Twitter to update the public on his and wife Rita Wilson's health after the star couple were diagnosed with the coronavirus yesterday in Australia. Here's what the actor said: ##Health## Emily Mitchell, from Salt Lake\u00a0City, is one of many Americans wondering whether the coronavirus can be transmitted through things like mail or money.  Dr.\u00a0Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, assuaged Mitchell's concern tonight during CNN's coronavirus town hall by saying if the disease were to transfer onto something like mail, it would likely be a low concentration.  \"Even if it is on there, would\u00a0it be high enough of a\u00a0concentration to actually be\u00a0transmitted?\u00a0Although it is important, I\u00a0don't want to downplay the\u00a0recommendations of wiping down\u00a0the kinds of things you can\u00a0easily wipe down.\u00a0Doorknobs, screens, things like\u00a0that.\u00a0I think if you start thinking\u00a0about money and mail and things\u00a0like that, you can almost sort\u00a0of immobilize yourself, which I\u00a0don't think is a good idea,\" Fauci said. ##Daily Life## ##Your Questions## Universal Orlando announced it will temporarily close its theme parks after this weekend until at least the end of March, but possibly longer. Universal Orlando\u2019s hotels and Universal City Walk will remain open, according to the announcement. Read the announcement here:  ##Business## ##Daily Life## At CNN's ongoing town hall, we're taking audience questions and answering them with medical experts weighing in. One viewer asked: What supplies should I get in case my community locks down? Here's what Dr.\u00a0Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had to say: Extra medication in case you can't get refills\nBottled water\nCanned food But he and CNN's Anderson Cooper acknowledged that sometimes health insurance doesn't allow for extra medication. \"We're looking at relieving a lot\u00a0of regulations and other things\u00a0to make it easier for people to\u00a0cope with this .. really somebody should\u00a0look at that,\" Fauci said. People have been panic buying: Stores have sold out of face masks, hand sanitizer, food staples, and more. The cleaning supplies can be good to have, especially soap and sanitizer \u2014 but one unusual item selling out is toilet paper. It's not entirely clear what is driving the panic buying of toilet paper. The trend began in Hong Kong last month after rumors that border closures would cut off the supply from China \u2014 but the rumors were dispelled by the government, and there don't appear to be any similar rumors in the US. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Your Questions## Just because someone who had the coronavirus is feeling better, that does not mean they still can't spread the disease, according to Dr.\u00a0Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci dispelled this misconception tonight during CNN's coronavirus town hall. \"You can become infected, get\u00a0symptomatic, resolve the\u00a0symptoms, feel well, and still\u00a0share the virus.\u00a0You can go back to your normal\u00a0life when you have two\u00a0consecutive tests for the\u00a0coronavirus that are negative,\u00a0separated by 24 hours.\u00a0That is an excellent question.\u00a0Just because you feel better or\u00a0feel well does not mean you are not\u00a0sharing the virus,\" Fauci said. ##Health## NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared on \"NBA on TNT\" tonight where he discussed the decision to suspend the league\u2019s season after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive for coronavirus, saying that the NBA\u2019s hiatus\u00a0\u201cwill most likely be at least 30 days.\u201d\u00a0 Silver didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of the season being canceled. Dr.\u00a0Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, believes the US will see \"a lot more\" coronavirus cases as the disease continues to spread. Fauci's remarks were made tonight during CNN's coronavirus town hall where he also discussed the need to get the number of coronavirus cases in the US to stabilize.  \"What we hope to do with both\u00a0containment and mitigation is\u00a0to get this peak to actually\u00a0flatten out,\" Fauci said. \"We will have a lot more cases.\u00a0The question is are we going to\u00a0blunt that peak?\u00a0The things we are doing by\u00a0preventing infections from\u00a0coming outside in with the\u00a0travel restrictions, which are\u00a0totally appropriate, and I\u00a0think very helpful as well as\u00a0doing containment and\u00a0mitigation from within.\" Watch: ##Health## ##Daily Life## CNN Correspondent David Culver, reporting from Shanghai, joined CNN's coronavirus town hall to describe the improving situation in China. Just a few weeks ago, the country was reporting thousands of cases a day. Now, it's down to about a dozen a day on average \u2014 a huge drop. \"What we need to stress though\u00a0is that it did not start out\u00a0this way,\" said Culver. \"Early on, go back seven weeks,\u00a0they had allegations of cover\u00a0ups, allegations of\u00a0underreporting, really only 200\u00a0tests a day for a sitting\u00a0population of 11 million.\" Remember: Whistleblowers in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, like Dr. Li Wenliang, tried to warn people and sound the alarm as early as December \u2014 but were punished and censored by local officials. Li later died of the coronavirus. What changed: The central government's involvement, Culver said. \"They pushed out the local\u00a0government.\u00a0They said, we're taking control.\u00a0It became a military-like\u00a0operation.\u00a0They began ramping up production\u00a0of face masks.\u00a0Our daily lives changed\u00a0drastically.\" What China looks like now: Things are slowly getting back to normal, now that the outbreak seems largely contained in most of the country. \"Just today the parks are\u00a0reopening in Shanghai,\u00a0restaurants have given the all\u00a0clear to have as many people as\u00a0they need to party-wise to come\u00a0in and book a table.\u00a0Tourist attractions are starting\u00a0to reopen,\" said Culver \u2014 a jarring difference from life in China just weeks ago, when people didn't dare go outside, and when major cities felt like ghost towns. ##Health## ##Daily Life## The PGA Tour announced late Thursday night that they are canceling The Players Championship taking place this week in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, and events across all Tours through the Valero Texas Open on April 2. \u201cWe have pledged from the start to be responsible, thoughtful and transparent with our decision process. We did everything possible to create a safe environment for our players in order to continue the event throughout the weekend, and we were endeavoring to give our fans a much-needed respite from the current climate. But at this point\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and as the situation continues to rapidly change\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the right thing to do for our players and our fans is to pause,\" the PGA said. ##Daily Life## ##Business## CNN has kicked off its two-hour coronavirus town hall with a look toward Europe, where every member country of the European Union has reported infections. \"It's fairly eerie here, where\u00a0we arrived just a few days ago\u00a0and the streets were full of people,\u00a0full of traffic,\" said CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman from Bologna, Italy, where he has been reporting on the nationwide lockdown. \"Now you go out in the main\u00a0square, the piazza, just up the street from\u00a0where we are, it's empty. By and large, it just has\u00a0completely transformed ordinary\u00a0life in this city.\" People can still go outside for a walk, jog, or run errands, said Wedeman \u2014 but people have to keep a certain distance from each other, and all public events or gatherings are canceled. That means even things like a children's soccer game are now prohibited under the emergency restrictions.  Churches are closed, even for people going in for private prayer \u2014 something that has never happened, even during wartime, Wedeman said. Some context: Italy has been under total lockdown since Monday. The nationwide lockdown extended measures already in place in the northern Lombardy region to the rest of the country, affecting about 60 million residents. This means restricted movement, schools closed, public services suspended, events canceled, and more.

Europe reacts to Trump's travel ban European\u00a0Union\u00a0leaders\u00a0said Thursday they disapprove\u00a0of\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to\u00a0ban\u00a0travel\u00a0from Europe to the\u00a0US\u00a0amid the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic.\u00a0 In a statement, the Presidents\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0European\u00a0Council and the\u00a0European\u00a0Commission, said that the outbreak is a \u201cglobal crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.\u201d \u201cThe\u00a0European\u00a0Union disapproves\u00a0of\u00a0the fact that the\u00a0US\u00a0decision to impose a\u00a0travel\u00a0ban\u00a0was taken unilaterally and without consultation,\u201d the statement from Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen read. The 30-day suspension, which begins Friday at midnight, marks a sharp escalation of measures taken to insulate Americans from the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak. Trump said he didn\u2019t consult European leaders before announcing US travel restrictions on 26 European countries because it would have taken too long. \u201cWe get along very well with European leaders, but we had to make a decision and I didn\u2019t want to take time and, you know, it takes a long time make the individual calls and we are calling and we had spoken to some of them prior to (the announcement),\u201d he said. The move could cost the US travel industry billions of dollars, according to the US Travel Association. \"Temporarily shutting off travel from Europe is going to exacerbate the already-heavy impact of coronavirus on the travel industry and the 15.7 million Americans whose jobs depend on travel,\u201d said US Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow in a statement today.\u00a0 The sports and entertainment worlds react Major sports leagues including the NBA, Italy's Serie A and US Major League Soccer are suspending or postponing their seasons. College basketball's March Madness tournament was also canceled. Major League Baseball announced that the start of the season will be delayed by at least two weeks and it has canceled the remaining spring training schedule. Disney Parks are closing their doors too. New York City is taking swift action. Mayor Bill De Blasio said Madison Square Garden and the Barclays Center, two major venues in the city, could be closed for months. Broadway is suspending all shows too.  In the entertainment world, two of the US' biggest late-night talk shows -- \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" are suspending production until March 30. The Tribeca Film Festival was also postponed. Markets continue to dive Wall Street is now officially in a bear market. US stocks on Thursday recorded their worst day since the 1987 crash, on rising fears about the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P 500 dropped more than 20% from its February 19 peak and was down 9.5% for the day -- its worst day since October 19, 1987, known as \u201cBlack Monday.\u201d  The index dropped 7% in the first minutes of trading, which triggered a circuit breaker and led the New York Stock Exchange to suspend trading for 15 minutes. The Dow finished 2,352 points, or nearly 10%, lower in its biggest one-day percentage drop since \u201cBlack Monday.\u201d The index is now at a level not seen since summer 2017. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 9.4%. It is now also in a bear market. There are at least\u00a01,635\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to state and local health agencies, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 70 cases are repatriated citizens, like those evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship or from China. 1,565 cases were detected and tested in the US, and are spread out across 46 states and the District of Columbia. 41 people have died across the US, the majority in Washington state. The tally includes presumptive positive cases -- patients who have tested positive in a public health lab and are pending final confirmation from the CDC. ##Health## Top US negotiators were unable to clinch a final agreement on a sweeping legislative package to address the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis tonight, pushing talks into Friday as they sought to close out a handful of outstanding issues.\u00a0 After hours of talks and trading of proposals, including eight separate phone calls between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- who is President Donald Trump\u2019s point person on the talks -- negotiators are still attempting to iron out differences on specific language.

According to the governor, the man had other underlying health conditions and was receiving care at a local hospital before he died. The man was not mobile, so the state is treating this as a case of community spread and health officials are now conducting public health contact tracing. Some context:\u00a0Kelly said this situation demanded that she declare an emergency, which will grant her administration the ability to activate state resources and mobilize personnel to assist where needed.
