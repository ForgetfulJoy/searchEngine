The short documentary \u201cThe Towers,\u201d directed by Oliver Arnoldi and Maria Chiu, was born out of that question. \u201cI was very interested in how they interact with a city like New York, how they live in it, how they get around physically,\u201d Arnoldi says.\n\nArnoldi\u2019s research in the fall of 2015 led him to Clinton Brown III. Brown is from Long Island and works in finance in Manhattan. He is a little person, and he manages the Towers, a basketball team made up of athletes who are little people.\n\nAmong the players\u2014 Jahmani Swanson, who now plays for the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nAfter Arnoldi met Brown and learned the team was gearing up to compete at the 2016 Little People of America National Conference, Arnoldi knew he had a film.\n\nArnoldi was studying documentary filmmaking at Columbia School of Journalism at the time he conceived the project, and he teamed up with another classmate, Chiu, to make it. It was their first time collaborating, and they didn\u2019t know each other well. But they quickly bonded over their shared interest in the topic and a willingness to dive in and do everything from producing to shooting to editing the film themselves.\n\nArnoldi and Chiu spent months with the guys before they followed them to Boston to film the team competing at the 2016 Little People of America National Conference\u2014one of the highlights of making \u201cThe Towers\u201d for both of the filmmakers. \u201cIt was really great of Little People of America to let us capture that,\u201d Chiu says, noting the organization generally prefers to keep the event private so that attendees can relax and enjoy themselves.\n\n\u201cIt was this week, this celebration, really, of these humans being allowed to just be their authentic selves, compete in sport and have fun,\u201d Arnoldi says.\n\nNeither filmmaker had shot a sporting event before making \u201cThe Towers.\u201d \u201cWe tried to get some advice from other people who have shot sports before just to get the basics,\u201d Chiu says. They also brought in a classmate, Nathan Bender, to run an additional camera during the big game at the convention.\n\nOnce the shoot wrapped, Arnoldi and Chiu had three months to edit \u201cThe Towers.\u201d Betsy West, who would go on to co-direct the Academy Award nominated documentary \u201cRBG,\u201d was one of their advisors on the project. Her guidance was invaluable. \u201cShe really helped us through the rough cut,\u201d Chiu says. \u201cShe sat down with us and went through what we were trying to say and all the characters we were holding on to.\u201d\n\nArnoldi\u2019s takeaway from the project? \u201cI felt like I had no assumptions about who he was as a person when I was going to meet Clinton. But during that first face-to-face conversation, I realized I did have a lot of assumptions about who he might be, or what his world view was, because he was a little person,\u201d Arnoldi says. \u201cThat conversation just completely blew all those assumptions out of the water.\u201d\n\nWhen we\u2019re not making films, we\u2019re watching them. Introducing \u201cGreat Big Spotlight,\u201d Great Big Story\u2019s latest series highlighting our favorite documentaries from some of the best filmmaking talent out there. \u201cThe Towers\u201d was directed, produced, shot and edited by Oliver Arnoldi and Maria Chiu."], "Language": false}
