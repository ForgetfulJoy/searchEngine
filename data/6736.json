In celebration of International Women's Day, Outdoor Voices is collaborating with \"The Powerpuff Girls\" on three limited-edition colorways of its Exercise Dress ($100; outdoorvoices.com). The dress is now available in lime green, bubblegum pink and baby blue to pay tribute to the iconic sister trio \u2014 Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup \u2014 best known for using their superpowers to defeat many a nearby criminal, monster and supervillain on the cult-favorite animated series.  When we tried the original exercise dress, it completely blew away our expectations as a remix of our traditional workout gear. The sporty dress is made from a breathable LightSpeed fabric that is lightweight and sweat-wicking. A super-soft bodysuit underneath the dress functions as a low-impact sports bra and bike short, which even has two pockets deep enough to hold an iPhone XR, keys, cards and headphones. Well-suited for everything from a 10-mile bike ride or 30-minute jog to running errands or drinks with friends, it revolutionized the kinds of activities we thought we couldn't do in a dress. In celebration of the partnership, you also get a free Powerpuff Girls sticker pack with the purchase of the dress in one of these signature Powerpuff colors. And, if you can wait until March 8, Outdoor Voices will donate 15% of all shop sales that day to the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, an initiative advocating against the legal barriers that prevent women from having equal rights in America.
