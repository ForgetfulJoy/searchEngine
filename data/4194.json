After several weeks of abiding by the order to stay home amid the coronavirus pandemic, Colbert showed off his overgrown locks in a photo shared on Twitter.  \"I might need a haircut #HeatMiser,\" he wrote, a reference to a character in the 1974 film \"The Year Without A Santa Claus.\"  Colbert, like many on late night, has continued to produce his show from his home and do good in the process.

World Central Kitchen has been on the front lines of the Covid-19 relief effort, providing food to health care workers and people in vulnerable communities.
