Warren Buffett struggles to find a takeover target Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2019 that he was eager to make an \"elephant-sized acquisition.\" One year later, he's still hunting for the right takeover candidate. \"We constantly seek to buy new businesses,\" Buffett said in his annual letter this past weekend. \"When we spot such businesses, our preference would be to buy 100% of them. But the opportunities to make major acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare.\" He continued: \"Far more often, a fickle stock market serves up opportunities for us to buy large, but non-controlling, positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.\" Some of those large stakes have caused Berkshire Hathaway to fall behind the broader market as of late. Investments in Delta and Wells Fargo have underperformed, and Berkshire shares have risen just 12% in the past year while the S&P 500 has gained more than 20%.
