From a celebrated American chef cooking creatively in southern China, to world-class sushi in Hong Kong or new wave Filipino dishes in Manila, you're truly spoiled for choice.   So whether you're a local or a visitor, here are 20 new restaurants bound to whet your appetite when you travel to the Asia-Pacific region in 2020: Mott 32, Marina Bay Sands Singapore Mott 32 is one of Hong Kong's most renowned contemporary Cantonese restaurants, famous in particular for its apple wood smoked roast Peking duck. They're set to launch in Singapore on January 24, having already set up shop in other overseas destinations including Vancouver and Las Vegas. The look reflects the elegant ambiance created by interior designer Joyce Wang in Hong Kong, while their mixology program also reflects the original venue.  Other signature dishes include barbecue Spanish pork with yellow mountain honey and creative luxe dim sum, such as a pork Siu Mai dumpling with black truffle and soft-boiled quail egg. Mott 32, Marina Bay Sands Singapore, B1-42-44, Galleria Level, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands; +65 6688 8888 MONO Hong Kong Venezuelan chef Ricardo Chaneton has one of the most impressive culinary resumes in Hong Kong, having formerly been head chef at Mirazur, the restaurant in the French Riviera voted #1 by World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2019. At MONO in the heart of Hong Kong's Central district, he crafts beautiful contemporary French cuisine, all to the soundtrack of his father's vinyl collection from the 1960s and '70s. As its name suggests, MONO's philosophy focuses on one essential ingredient per dish across set lunches and dinner tasting menus. A ceviche of carabinero shrimp, scallops and Brittany oysters may set the tone, before Arctic char with sancho pepper confirms his sublime touch. MONO Hong Kong, 5/F, 18 On Lan Street, Central, Hong Kong Koral, The Apurva Kempinski Bali, Indonesia There's definitely an unusual draw at Koral restaurant in Bali's Apurva Kempinski hotel --  it's the tropical island's only underwater dining venue. Koral is inspired by the Majapahit empire, which brought prosperity to all of Indonesia for three centuries. Design motifs include black and white tiles that were once seen at the royal court. Unsurprisingly, however, eyes are mostly drawn to the glass-roofed tunnel where tropical fish abound. Although seafood features on the menu, its signature dish is Tomatoes Bedugul, a celebration of the humble fruit served in multiple ways, including as a consomm\u00e9, with creamy mozzarella and even as a sorbet made with tomato oil. Koral, The Apurva Kempinski Bali, Lot 4, Jl. Raya Nusa Dua Selatan, Benoa Kec. Kuta Sel., Kabupaten Badung, Bali, Indonesia; +62 361 209 2288 Halapua, Kapuhala Samui, Thailand Over on the popular Thai island of Koh Samui, Halapua claims to be the island's first plant-based fine dining restaurant. Using local produce where possible from the on-site farm, chef Gregory Hill plays with modern techniques to re-imagine classic French dishes like foie gras using mushrooms, walnuts, lentils and rosemary. Other options include gnocchi made with curried pumpkin, purple sweet potato and black garlic or intriguing grilled eggplant with tomato relish, edamame falafel and brie cheese. Hill has worked in Mexico, Indonesia, China and Thailand and has made it his mission to prove that plant-based cuisine is neither tasteless nor boring. Halapua, Kapuhala Samui, 104/86 Moo 3, Bophut; +66 77 950 608  Kinu by Takagi, Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok, Thailand Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok is one of the Thai capital's most historic hotels and following its recent extensive renovations, a new Japanese kaiseki-style restaurant Kinu by Takagi is set to tempt diners. It's the first restaurant in Thailand for two-Michelin-starred chef Takagi Kazuo of Japan's Kyoto Cuisine Takagi. His specialty is cuisine from the elegant city of Kyoto known as Kyo-ryori, prepared as 10-course seasonal menus where guests are left in his hands. If that sounds substantial, dishes are elegant and light with a typical Japanese aesthetic and a mix of the best ingredients from Japan and Thailand. Dinner may be accompanied by sake and ends with a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Kinu by Takagi, Mandarin Oriental, 48 Oriental Avenue, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 2 659 9000 Esterre, Palace Hotel Tokyo, Japan Legendary French chef Alain Ducasse has a global portfolio of restaurants, many holding Michelin stars. The latest addition, Esterre, is in Tokyo. It celebrates his modern haute cuisine in an historic hotel that was one of the first to bring French cuisine to the Japanese capital -- more than 50 years ago.  Esterre translates as Mother Earth in the Occitan dialect of France where chef Ducasse was born and the culinary philosophy emphasizes and celebrates vegetables, grains and fruits -- taking them beyond their traditional role as an accompaniment to a dish. You can expect to see ingredients like chickpeas, quinoa, leeks, mushrooms and nuts as the hero, while desserts forgo refined sugar in favor of natural fruit sweetness. Esterre, Palace Hotel Tokyo, 6/F, Palace Hotel Tokyo, 1-1-1 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan; +81 3 3211 5317 Associazione Chianti, Hong Kong Florence is one of the world's greatest dining cities and Hong Kong diners are now able to channel some of its unique attractions at Associazione Chianti, a Tuscan trattoria that combines butchery and top-notch wine. The menu's main event is I Tagli del Macellaio or the Butcher's Cut -- prime Black Angus from Idaho that is dry-aged in-house, seasoned and cooked on a Tuscan broiler. The show-stopper amongst them is the substantial Bistecca alla Fiorentina, usually generous enough for four to share. Housemade pastas could include a Chianti beef ragu inspired by Florence's famed Trattoria Cammillo, while wine lovers can take their pick from what is easily the city's most extensive collection of Chianti. Associazione Chianti Hong Kong, 15 Ship Street, Wan Chai, Hong Kong; +852 3619 3360 Char by Four Seasons Resort Chiang Mai, Thailand Up in northern Thailand, the city of Chiang Mai is renowned for its cuisine and the newly launched Char celebrates local traditions with 70% of the menu being cooked over open flames. The majority of ingredients are locally sourced and join premium cuts cooked over grills or in their fire-pit, where Italian chef Marco Avesani leads the team. Australian lamb rack, organic chicken, Arctic char or Black Angus tomahawk are just some of the options. Their own house sauces include srira-char to complement the grilled meats. Desserts continue the theme with chargrilled pineapples or local twists like fermented sticky rice in a cheesecake. Artisans from around Chiang Mai have crafted the tableware, cutlery and more to complete the sustainable and locally driven feel.

A mix of informality and sophistication in both design and food, the 42-seat space celebrates what is available in local markets. Techniques frequently include curing, especially in home-made salumi, while fermentation again demonstrates its critical role within Filipino cuisine. Boutwood explains the guiding principle of The Test Kitchen: \"Time is an ingredient. We want to make sure that we use techniques that amplify the flavor and not hide it.\" That translates to dishes like his \"porridge,\" which sounds simple but combines barley, abalone, shiso and more with red miso. The Test Kitchen Manila, G/F One Rockwell, Rockwell Drive, Rockwell Center, Makati City, Philippines; +63 977 288 5751   ZA ZA TA Bar and Kitchen, Brisbane, Australia ZA ZA TA Bar and Kitchen is a memorably named new destination in Brisbane that serves up dishes from the Middle East and Mediterranean. The quirky setting is reminiscent of a typical local Queenslander house, complete with vintage designs including furniture and art. Executive chef Roy Ner channels the vibrant Tel Aviv food and bar scene and serves up creative dishes like beetroot pastrami and horseradish on smoked rye, fried pretzels with goat's cheese and homemade lamb bacon. There are also no fewer than six breads on offer every day, with Yemenite butter bread served with a tomato and chili hot sauce called zhug already a favorite with diners.

It's also the neighborhood vibe channeled at The Chow Kit Kitchen. Cleverly designed to look and feel like a heritage building, it features black and white photographs of Kuala Lumpur life from over the years. Dishes reflect Malaysian favorites, sometimes with contemporary global spins.

It's named after the opening year of its home, the Grand Hotel d' Angkor, and boasts a special claim as one of only two restaurants in Cambodia permitted to serve Royal Khmer cuisine -- namely recipes passed by royal decree from the former king's own kitchen.  Diners can therefore enjoy historical favorites like spicy and sour lobster consomm\u00e9, grilled lamb chops in ginger sauce or pumpkin custard for dessert. 1932, Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor Siem Reap, 1 Vithei Charles de Gaulle, Siem Reap, Cambodia; +855 63 963 888 John Anthony, JW Marriott Hanoi, Vietnam Cantonese cuisine from Hong Kong is again on the menu, this time at the JW Marriott in Hanoi.
