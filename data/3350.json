Nebraska\u00a0Crossing Outlets says it will fully open its doors on April 24 for brick and mortar shopping. The outlets will allow its more than 80 tenants to invite customers to shop in what it called a \u201csoft opening.\u201d Nebraska\u00a0Crossing Outlets, near Omaha, would become one of the first malls to fully open back up across the country. Owner and developer Rod Yates told CNN his tenants, which include several global retail brands, asked to use his outdoor outlet as a case study to see what best practices are necessary to start opening storefronts across the country and globe.\u00a0 \u201cAt some point here, we got to start thinking about how brick and mortar is going to interact with retailers and customers and so we found an opportunity here to kind of do that,\u201d Yates said in an interview with CNN.  \u201cWe\u2019ll experiment, we're going to walk, we're going to be very, very cautious,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u00a0 The mall has largely been open for individual stores to fulfill curbside pick-up orders but haven\u2019t let customers actually inside the stores.\u00a0This soft opening would change that. The outlet mall is home to retailers like Nike, Adidas, Polo Ralph Lauren, Kate Spade among others. Some background: Nebraska\u00a0is one of seven states in the US to have no official stay-at-home order. With less than 1,000 cases statewide, Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered businesses like hair salons, tattoo parlors and strip clubs to be closed until May 31 but only \u201curged\u201d individuals to practice social distancing guidelines without making them mandatory. The state\u2019s peak is expected around May 2, eight days after the outlet mall reopens. Yates said he\u2019s communicated with Ricketts about the outdoor mall opening, saying the governor cautioned against creating any mass opening events \u2014 leading to the \u201csoft opening\u201d that will gradually transition to a full opening in May, according to a letter sent to stores. As a precaution, Yates said the mall bought 100 of infrared forehead thermometers to give to each store, encouraging them to take the temperatures of employees and possibly even customers. But the use is not mandatory. Covid-19 can be contagious even when those infected don\u2019t have fevers. Yates said he will also leave crowd size regulation up to individual stores. The outdoor mall sits on more than 40 acres of land, Yates said, but shop sizes vary so creating a one-size fits all mandate for stores isn\u2019t ideal. He does not expect all stores will participate in the opening.\u00a0 \u00a0 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that the state will have access to 1 million N95 masks. \"Today, in consultation from the White House, we have received or will receive a total of 1 million N95 masks, those are probably the most sought after piece of PPE right now, there's obviously been a worldwide run on that. Working with the White House, they've earmarked us a million,\" DeSantis said at a news conference Tuesday. He said Florida's Emergency Management Department will also be delivering 1.2 million\u200bprocedure masks, 100,000 face shields, 500,000 gloves, 60,000 containers of hand sanitizer, and 35,000 gowns. In total, DeSantis said the state will have distributed: 8 million masks\n5.5 million gloves\n564,000 shoe covers\n615,000 face shields\n300,000 gowns\nMore than 100,000 containers of hand sanitizer\n47,000 goggles\n22,000 coveralls This post was updated to accurately reflect the number of gowns. President Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared on Fox News after the White House briefing to defend the President\u2019s WHO funding halt and discuss how it could impact US-China relations. \u201cThe World Health Organization is a single failure during this epidemic. They basically hid information from the public, they failed to call this a pandemic long after others had rightfully done so. There is blood on their hands. I think President Trump is absolutely correct to have a full investigation of how that happened and what China\u2019s role might\u2019ve been to that,\" Navarro said. Pressed on how this could impact future trade negotiations with China, he called those \u201cinteresting questions\u201d but went on to talk about supply chains. Asked again later in the interview how coronavirus will impact the US-China relationship, Navarro said, \u201cWe have to find out where it originated. We have to understand why China did not tell us for six weeks in which we lost precious time preparing for a pandemic.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis is something we will not forget: China was basically vacuuming up the world\u2019s PPE around the world so that we didn\u2019t have it in New York and people didn\u2019t have it in Milan. That\u2019s a question that has to be answered. The question going forward is will they provide the PPE to the world as we go through this crisis without strings?\u201d Honolulu will begin requiring people to wear facial coverings when visiting essential businesses starting Monday.\u00a0 Mayor Kirk Caldwell said the new requirement applies to businesses like grocery stores. People will not be required to have a commercially-produced mask, he said. \u00a0It's another layer of protection.\u00a0It's not perfect,\u201d Caldwell said at a news conference on Tuesday. The mayor said the order does not apply to people working in offices that are not open to the public, although facial coverings are still recommended at those businesses.\u00a0People also must cover their faces when riding public transportation. To avoid confusion, Caldwell said there is one major exception to the rule: no one should wear a mask in a bank.  \u201cUsually when people go into a bank with a mask, it's not a good outcome,\u201d Caldwell said. ##Daily Life## The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents over 900,000 grocery workers, said today that 30 union members have died from coronavirus. UFCW said another nearly 3,000 food and grocery workers \u201chave been directly impacted by COVID-19,\u201d based on reports from local unions. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic represents the greatest health and safety crisis that America\u2019s grocery and food workers have ever faced. Since the beginning of the outbreak, these workers have been on the front lines of this terrible pandemic,\u201d UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement.  Perrone continued: \u201cWhile tens of millions of Americans were told to work from home for their safety, grocery store and food workers have never had that option. More must be done to protect them and our food supply now.\u201d The directly impacted workers include those who have tested positive for Covid-19, missed work due to self-quarantine, are awaiting test results, have been hospitalized or are symptomatic, the union said.\u00a0 The UFCW says it representing 1.3 million people in grocery stores, meatpacking, food processing, retail shops and other industries and has members in all 50 US states, Canada and Puerto Rico. ##Health## The largest professional association of physicians, the American Medical Association, labeled President Trump\u2019s announcement that he will put a hold on funding for the World Health Organization as \u201cdangerous.\u201d AMA President Dr. Patrice A. Harris issued a statement today in response to Trump's announcement. Here's a portion of her statement: \u201cDuring the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating Covid-19 easier. \nFighting a global pandemic requires international cooperation and reliance on science and data. Cutting funding to the WHO \u2013 rather than focusing on solutions \u2013 is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world. The AMA is deeply concerned by this decision and its wide-ranging ramifications, and we strongly urge the President to reconsider.\u201d What we know: During a White House press briefing today, Trump announced he will halting funding while a review is conducted. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker praised President Trump for saying during the White House press briefing that it was up to the states to decide when to reopen their economies.  \"Well, it's a good thing that\u00a0the President finally recognized\u00a0that it's the Constitution that\u00a0authorizes the governors to have\u00a0the power to reopen their\u00a0states.\u00a0And so I appreciate that,\" he said. He added:\u00a0\"I think (New York) Gov. (Andrew) Cuomo had it\u00a0right when he said that the\u00a0President is not a king.\u00a0He's President of the United\u00a0States of America.\u00a0And so we're looking forward to\u00a0evaluating what it is that we're\u00a0going to do going forward.\u00a0The most important thing that\u00a0we'll do is focus on the safety\u00a0and health of the people of our\u00a0states.\u00a0In my case, you know, I've made\u00a0it clear, we need testing,\u00a0tracing, contact tracing, and we\u00a0need a treatment.\u00a0Put that together with readily\u00a0available PPE, and then you can\u00a0start to talk about how you will\u00a0reopen an economy.\" On the issue of acquiring supplies, Pritzker said he isn't relying on the federal government for help. \"We've gotten very little help\u00a0from the federal government,\" he said.\u00a0\"It's fine.\u00a0I've given up on any promises\u00a0that had been made.\u00a0I hope something will get\u00a0delivered from the federal\u00a0government, but I don't expect\u00a0it anymore.\" ##Health## The surgery chair of a New York City hospital says more patients are departing than arriving. Dr. Craig Smith of the\u00a0New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center also said the number of patients in the Intensive Care Unit and on ventilators appears to be leveling off at two hospitals who are bearing the brunt of those cases. Smith wrote these details in a daily note to faculty and staff. \u201cThese trends support our pivot towards restoration of normal,\u201d Smith wrote. There are also less autopsies: Smith says autopsies have become uncommon in most settings, notes \u201cphone consent is not considered acceptable\u201d \u201cWe have very little idea why Covid-19 is so lethal and resistant to treatment in certain patients,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAutopsy in Covid mortalities has a relatively high probability of contributing to the advancement of medical science.\" He added: \"Because phone consent is not considered acceptable\u2014a significant hurdle when visitors are not allowed. We are pursuing solutions to that unintended consequence of an administrative policy that was less often objectionable pre-pandemic.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins pressed President Trump on his previous praise for China\u2019s transparency on coronavirus. \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!\u201d Trump tweeted on Jan. 24, as he and his administration downplayed the outbreak. Days later, Trump announced he was banning foreign nationals who had traveled to China from entering the US. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about China\u2019s transparency,\u201d Trump claimed in the Rose Garden Tuesday, citing his travel ban as evidence. \u201cI was the one person that wanted to do it. You know why? Because I don\u2019t believe everything I hear,\u201d Trump said of his travel ban decision. According to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States, there are at least\u00a0602,989\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the United States. On Tuesday, Johns Hopkins reported\u00a020,382\u00a0new cases in the United States. ##Health## San Francisco Pride has decided to cancel its parade and celebration this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the organization announced in a statement today. \u201cUncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified in recent weeks, and the organization has concluded that the risks to public health of a large-scale gathering such as Pride preclude this year\u2019s production of the annual event,\u201d the statement said. The two day event in San Francisco, scheduled for June 27 and 28, would have marked San Francisco Pride\u2019s 50th anniversary with over a million attendees, according to the statement. \u201cThis was not a decision we arrived at lightly,\u201d San Francisco Pride Executive Director Fred Lopez said. Nonprofit event producers are working to determine alternate ways to celebrate the 50th\u00a0anniversary through digital platforms. SF Pride will join other Pride organizations in a worldwide \u201cVirtual Global Pride\u201d event on June 27. President Trump says he'll soon reveal details and guidelines for reopening the country but appeared to acknowledge that individual state governors will ultimately determine when to reverse stay-at-home orders. Only a day earlier, Trump insisted he had absolute authority to determine when states would be able to reopen their economies. But his message Tuesday was different. He said governors would determine their own plans. And while he said he was authorizing them to do it, there wasn't any evidence they would require such sign-off.  Trump said he would be \"authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state.\" He said he would soon speak to all 50 governors about the plans, and indicated some states without major outbreaks could potentially open before May 1. He said his administration would work to hold governors accountable for the plans. But he said they'd be working closely with the states. Watch: President Trump announced Tuesday he is halting funding to the World Health Organization while a review is conducted. Trump said at a news conference the review would cover the WHO\u2019s \u201crole in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus.\u201d The President said that while the US imposed travel restrictions on China during the early stages of the outbreak, WHO was \"opposed to what we did,\" he said. \"Other nations and regions who\u00a0followed WHO guidelines and\u00a0kept their borders open to\u00a0China, accelerated the pandemic\u00a0around the world,\" Trump said. Trump continued: \"The decision of other major\u00a0countries to keep travel open\u00a0was one of the great tragedies\u00a0and missed opportunities from\u00a0the early days.\" California said it has 1,544 new coronavirus cases \u2013 the highest number recorded in a single day since the beginning of the outbreak. These additional cases bring the total in California to 23,338. More than 11% of those patients are health care workers, according to new data from California Department of Public Health. At least 758 people have died in California due to coronavirus. ##Health## Dyson is gearing up for full-scale production of ventilators to help with the coronavirus pandemic. The company has confirmed that its production lines based at the Hullavington Airfield in England are now in the process of manufacturing ventilator units in preparation for final regulatory approval.\u00a0 \u201cIf this new ventilator passes MHRA tests, full scale production can begin,\u201d Dyson said Tuesday, adding that the engineering firm is \u201cready to make 10,000 ventilators to support this NHS\u201d in its fight against coronavirus.\u00a0 In a letter shared with CNN in March, James Dyson \u2013 the company\u2019s billionaire founder \u2013 confirmed that the company had received an order from the UK government for 10,000 ventilators. In a video shared by Dyson today, the company showcased its latest development, highlighting that engineering teams and manufacturers have been working \u201caround the clock\u201d to develop this new ventilator.\u00a0 \u201cDyson and TTP have worked together to develop an entirely new design of ventilator in record time for the clinical needs of COVID-19 patients,\u201d Dyson said.\u00a0 The video continued: \u201cThe project has brought together engineers, scientists, medical device designers, clinical testing and high technology manufacturing knowledge, to achieve the NHS specification.\" In March, a spokesperson for Dyson told CNN that they hoped to have the ventilators ready for mass production by early April 2020.\u00a0 ##Health## New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said today that she doesn't believe the city's biggest events \u2014 French Quarter Festival, JazzFest and Essence Festival \u2014 should be held in 2020, but instead push to 2021.  All three events had been postponed in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  Cantrell said she's been in touch with event organizers but did not give any additional details on those conversations.\u00a0 As of mid-March, the French Quarter Festival and JazzFest posted on their social media that the events were postponed to the fall of 2020. Nothing new has been updated since then. ##Daily Life## Prosecutors are asking a federal judge to postpone the trial of associates of Rudy Giuliani by at least four months until February due to the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s impact on the criminal justice system. In a letter to Judge Paul Oetken, prosecutors also said they informed lawyers for Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and two other men charged in a campaign finance scheme that their plans to bring additional charges against the men have also been impacted.\u00a0 The \u201ctimeline for seeking a superseding indictment has been pushed back due to issues involving the availability of witnesses and grand jurors given the pandemic-related travel and social-distancing restrictions,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\u00a0 Parnas and Fruman had been schedule to go to trial on October 5, about one month before the presidential election. The men, who were central players in Giuliani\u2019s effort to dig up dirt on Joseph and Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in the Ukraine, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\u00a0 The coronavirus pandemic has ground the criminal justice system to a halt across the country with grand juries disrupted and criminal and civil trials postponed. In the Southern District of New York trials are postponed until at least June 1.\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors didn\u2019t object to a request by lawyers for the defendants who sought to postpone the trial because of their difficulty of meeting with their clients, who are based in Florida and California, and prepare for trial. If the trial is delayed, it would remove the potential for information about Giuliani\u2019s associates spilling into the public just weeks ahead of the presidential election. Other high profile trials have also been postponed. Michael Avenatti, the celebrity attorney, was set to go to trial this month on charges he stole more than $300,000 from his former client Stormy Daniels. A federal judge set a new trial date for August.\u00a0 Paul Manafort's lawyers have also asked for the former Trump campaign chairman to be moved out of prison due to potential health risks from the coronavirus. There are at least\u00a0594,207\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and at least\u00a025,163\u00a0people have died from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. On Tuesday, Johns Hopkins has reported\u00a011,600\u00a0new cases and\u00a01,535\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases. ##Health## Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said that he and a number of his gubernatorial counterparts think President Trump is off-base with his desire to reopen the nation\u2019s economy by May 1.  \u201cPresident Trump has put out the date of May 1, which I think most of the governors think is a very premature,\u201d Lamont said at a news conference. \u201cI just showed you that hospitalizations are going up and infections are going up, and this is no time to take our eye off the ball.\u201d Lamont instead reiterated the May 20 date he offered on CNN's New Day\u00a0Tuesday morning as more of a realistic timeframe when he could make an informed decision about when to reopen the state.  \u201cI said we're not gonna be reopening schools before May 20, but by May 20 we're gonna have a lot of our testing in place by then, we'll have a lot more of the PPE, the protective gear,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cAnd that will give us a lot stronger indication about who and when and how people can start getting to work.\u201d ##Daily Life## California\u2019s health director told CNN that the state is not completely ready to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet, but we are cautiously optimistic,\u201d Dr. Sonia Angell, California\u2019s health director, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\" \u201cThis is the right time to start talking to Californians about what it might look like as we start loosening restrictions,\" she added. Angell noted that there are a number of quick indicators that will help leaders make decisions to proceed and that it\u2019s time to start modifying orders in a way that's safe for Californians. \"We're not sure this is the end of it, but it's a good moment to take stock and look at what it might look like as we get back to normal,\" Angell said. The new normal will be about creating space for people to safely leave their home but keeping those with greater risk at home, she said. Watch: ##Health## A drug that\u2019s been touted by President Trump as a \u201cgame changer\u201d didn\u2019t help hospitalized patients with coronavirus, and was associated with heart complications, according to a new study.\u00a0 \u201cThis provides evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not apparently treat patients with\u00a0Covid-19,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cEven worse, there were side effects caused by the drug \u2013 heart toxicities that required it be discontinued.\u201d The study was published Tuesday on a pre-print\u00a0server\u00a0and was not peer reviewed. In the study, among the 84 patients who took hydroxychloroquine, 20.2% were admitted to the ICU or died within seven days of inclusion. Among the 97 patients who did not take the drug, 22.1% went to the ICU or died.\u00a0 The difference was determined to not be statistically significant. Looking just at deaths, 2.8% of the patients who took hydroxychloroquine died, and 4.6% of the patients who did not take it died. That difference was also found to not be statistically significant. ##Health## An official at San Francisco's Department of Emergency Management told CNN 102 people at MSC South shelter have coronavirus. Ninety-two of the cases are among homeless individuals and 10 are among staff members. This is an increase of 11 more positive cases from the 91 that were reported at the shelter Monday. MSC South\u00a0shelter can typically accommodate as many as 340 people per night, an official at the department said.\u00a0 ##Health## Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced Tuesday schools will remain closed through the end of the school year. \"I know how hard teachers, students, all staff, and parents have been working during this dangerous time,\" he said at a news conference. \"You have my deep respect and sincere admiration. It has been so encouraging to see the efforts of our education community to protect the people of Mississippi while ensuring learning takes place.\" \"I know our education community will do whatever it takes to make sure Mississippi kids don\u2019t fall behind,\" he said. ##Daily Life## Major US airlines have accepted the government\u2019s terms to receive billions of aid and keep hundreds of thousands of employees on the payrolls, the Treasury Department announced Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0 American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines are among those who have accepted the offer, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a statement.\u00a0 It did not specify the exact terms of the agreement, but in recent days, the carriers and government have been discussing terms that include 30% of the aid coming as low-cost loans.\u00a0\u00a0 Mnuchin said the department \u201cis also working to review and approve applications for smaller passenger air carriers as quickly as possible,\u201d and would take up discussions with cargo carriers \u201cvery soon.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 The $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus aid package President Trump signed last month includes more than $58 billion to prop up the aviation industry \u2014 half of it to help airlines fund employee payroll costs through September.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In exchange for accepting the funds, airlines must agree to prohibitions on stock buybacks and layoffs, and limits on executive compensation.\u00a0Airlines must also provide at least a minimum level of service \u2014 as few as one flight weekly \u2014 to the destinations currently served.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Transportation Department on Tuesday separately announced how it would allocate around $10 billion in aid to airports around the nation.\u00a0 ##Travel## On an April 6 phone call,\u00a0members of a prestigious scientific committee\u00a0told members of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy there are issues with the availability and reliability of the antibody tests in the United States right now.\u00a0 \"In three words: Work in progress,\" said Dr. David Relman,\u00a0a member of the National Academy of Sciences committee\u00a0who was on the call.\u00a0 A few days after the phone call, the NAS scientists wrote a letter to the White House frankly apprising them about the quality of antibody tests. Antibody tests check to see if a person has previously been infected with Covid-19, an indication that they've had the virus and now could be immune to it.\u00a0 Results from antibody tests \"should be viewed as suspect until rigorous controls are performed and performance characteristics described, as antibody detection methods can vary considerably, and most so far have not described well-standardized controls,\" according to the letter. There are good tests\u00a0in the midst of the bad ones, but they're not yet widely and easily available throughout the country. It\u2019s not entirely clear\u00a0that having antibodies to Covid-19 means that you truly have immunity and won't get the disease again. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy did not respond to requests from CNN to describe what it learned on the April 6 call or how officials plan to use the information the scientists gave them.\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Harvey Fineberg, chairman of the NAS committee, who was also on the phone call with the White House, said he felt that the White House officials paid close attention on the call.\u00a0 \"That's the brilliance of Kelvin\u00a0Droegemeier, to elicit this kind of input and turn to the academics in the first place,\" Fineberg said, referring to the director of the White House policy office. \"They're genuinely trying to widen their aperture for advice, and I think so far it's working.\"\u00a0 ##Health## The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has released nearly 700 people from custody after conducting medical reviews\u00a0stemming from\u00a0concerns about coronavirus, according to Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli. The move comes amid lawsuits calling for the release of ICE detainees, as well as newly introduced legislation to require the release of most people in ICE detention during a national emergency related to a communicable disease.\u00a0 ICE reviewed its cases to identify people who would be eligible for release, including detainees who are 60 years old and over and those who are pregnant. The agency later expanded its review to include all people in ICE custody to assess those who have \u201cmedical fragility,\" Cuccinelli said. As of April 10, ICE has identified 693 people for release after evaluating medical history, as well as other factors such as criminal records, flight risk and national security concerns. When the assessments for release began, ICE had around 37,000 people in detention, according to Cuccinelli.\u00a0 There are now fewer than 34,000 people in detention. However, that decrease is due to a slower pace of intake and\u00a0ongoing\u00a0deportations, not just medical releases.\u00a0 Detainees who are released are put on \"alternatives to detention,\" which\u00a0could include an ankle monitor, but not always.\u00a0 \u00a0When individuals rooms aren't available, ICE separates detainees by group following exposure to someone with an infectious disease, said Cuccinelli. This could include asymptomatic detainees for the duration of the incubation period.\u00a0 ICE has also made changes to its enforcement operations, legal and family visitation and detention operations due to Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0 ###\u00a0 After loosening restrictions on antibody tests, the US Food and Drug Administration has decided the government will review data on lab tests that claim they can detect if someone has antibodies to Covid-19, according to the CEO of a lab association who was on a call with FDA officials this morning.\u00a0 On March 16, the FDA loosened its standards and allowed companies to sell antibody tests without submitting any evidence that they worked.\u00a0 That led to \u201ccrappy\u201d tests flooding the market, according to Scott Becker, CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Becker said he hopes the scientific review of the tests, which will be performed by the National Cancer Institute, will lead to the distribution of tests that actually work properly. Why this matters: A false positive \u2014 telling someone they have antibodies when they don\u2019t \u2014 could have grave consequences, since that person would then think they\u2019re immune to Covid-19 when they\u2019re not. FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn has talked about the need to review the tests. \u201cI am concerned that some of the antibody tests that are on the market that haven\u2019t gone through the FDA scientific review may not be as accurate as we\u2019d like them to be,\u201d Hahn said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday. \u201cI can assure the American people that what we\u2019re doing is using data and science to look at those tests to make sure they\u2019re valid, they\u2019re accurate, and they\u2019re reproducible.\u201d The FDA did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. ##Health## Rio de Janeiro state governor Wilson Witzel confirmed Tuesday that he tested positive for coronavirus. In a video on his official Twitter account, Witzel said he hadn\u2019t been feeling well since last Friday and decided to get tested. \u201cI had a fever, my throat was hurting, weakened sense of smell and, thank God, I am feeling okay,\u201d he said in the video message.

The money for the program\u00a0will come out of the state fund originally but will be backfilled by federal dollars, according to Sununu. The\u00a0money will go to\u00a0health care providers,\u00a0but\u00a0100% of the money has to be given to frontline workers. The\u00a0program is designed to try\u00a0to retain workers in this area and so these older populations have continuity of care. The program, which will go through June, will hopefully be taken over by the federal government, Sununu added.\u00a0 ##Health## Just a few hours after meeting in person with recovered COVID-19 patients, President Trump on Tuesday hosted a small group of hospital executives in the Cabinet Room.\u00a0 Rear Adm.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u00a0and the Department of Health and Human Services are supporting the initiative, he said.\u00a0 \u201cOther countries,\u201d Trump said, have also been asking the US for ventilators, noting that he just got off the phone with French President Emanuel Macron and the US has been asked by \u201ceverybody\u201d for ventilators. He said the US has an \u201cobligation\u201d to help other countries, including, Italy, France, Spain, \u201cand a lot of other countries\u201d acquire ventilators.\u00a0 He acknowledged that there is a \u201cneed\u201d for ventilators and he had heard \u201cfears\u201d from the nation\u2019s governors about shortages. \"When the virus struck our nation, governors raised fears that people who needed ventilators would not get the ventilators. My administration has used the Defense Production Act and that\u2019s really had a big impact on companies and companies wanting to get them done and get them done quickly. We're preparing ventilator capacity for any and all scenarios. Initiatives like the dynamic ventilator reserve will help us to achieve that goal. We need ventilators, but now we're pretty well stocked,\u201d Trump said. All of the executives went around the table. Trump asked one of the attendees, Rick Pollack of the American Hospital Association, about the differing qualities of ventilators. Louisiana Gov.

Gavin Newsom said people \"bent the curve\" in the state by following the stay-at-home order. \u201cYou have bent the curve in the state of California. The models have changed because of your behavior,\u201d he said at a news conference. Newsom acknowledged that the stay-home order is finite and will not be a permanent way of life.\u00a0 Here's how he put it: \u201cWe also extend a recognition in that light that this can't be a permanent state, and I want you to know it's not, it will not be a permanent state. We recognize the consequences of these stay-at-home orders have a profound impact on the economy, your personal household budget, your personal prospects around your future if you've just lost a job or you lost wages, or you're struggling with your dream and that is to keep your dream afloat as a business person that may put everything on the line.\" ##Daily Life## ##Health# California Gov. Gavin Newsom just unveiled six key indicators the state will use when \"thinking for when and how to modify the stay-at-home and other orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" \u201cScience, not politics must be the guide,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference moments ago. \u201cIt cannot be ideological.\u201d The framework outlined by the governor focuses on six prongs: Expanded testing, and tracking infected individuals (quarantine, isolation)\nProtect vulnerable communities\nAddress hospital needs (personal protective equipment, ICU beds, ventilators)\nEngage academia and technology\n\u201cRedraw floor plans\u201d as they pertain to physical distancing in businesses, school sites, public and private business\nReinstate vigorous controls with the ability to toggle back and forth as needed He said the goal of the plan is to achieve things like ensuring the hospital system can care for sick patients, preventing infection in people who are high-risk and reducing \"social, emotional and economic disruptions,\" according to a statement. The state\u2019s lockdown is currently in effect until May 3. A number of California counties, including Los Angeles, have already extended their stay home order to May 15. ##Daily Life## The coronavirus could change the way many Americans vote this November. Many leading Democrats\u00a0have called\u00a0for more voting by mail to ensure Americans can stay safe while casting their ballots. But President Trump, on other hand, has charged that voting by mail as \"corrupt\" \u2014 an assertion not backed by the facts. The dueling partisan responses might lead you to believe that voting by mail benefits Democrats more than Republicans. You'd be wrong \u2014 at least according to one new paper. The paper,\u00a0from the Democracy & Polarization Lab at Stanford University, looked at three states \u2014 California, Utah and Washington \u2014 that turned to vote by mail in staggered fashion across counties. This allows us to really see the effects of voting by mail.\u00a0\u00a0 The findings: It turns out that voting by mail does\u00a0not\u00a0give either party any edge in turnout. Further, there was no discernible effect on election outcomes.\u00a0 What voting by mail did seem to do was cause some increase in voter turnout, which would be the point of more voting by mail during this pandemic.\u00a0 We saw a\u00a0record number of people\u00a0cast a ballot by mail in the Wisconsin primary. In Wisconsin, like in the the majority of other states, voters have the option of voting by mail if they want.\u00a0 This new paper suggests that this option may be our best hope to allow Americans to participate in the Democratic process during the coronavirus outbreak without either side gaining a clear edge.\u00a0It\u00a0comes on top of statements\u00a0from multiple Republican leading officials who have made similar claims.\u00a0 General Motors is ready to ship its first production of ventilators starting today, the company said in a statement. \u201cEveryone wants to help turn the tide\u00a0and save lives.\u00a0It is inspiring\u00a0and humbling\u00a0to\u00a0see the\u00a0passion and commitment people have put into this work,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. GM started building ventilators in partnership with Ventec for Covid-19 patients last month at their Kokomo plant in Indiana. There will be 600 ventilators shipped by the end of this month, with the rest of the government\u2019s 30,000 ventilator order completed by the end of August. \u201cGM has moved swiftly in Trump time to manufacture one of the most critical lifesaving devices in America\u2019s war against the coronavirus.\u00a0GM\u2019s rapid mobilization of America\u2019s manufacturing might in defense of our country is a proud salute to the ingenuity of its engineers, the true grit of its UAW workers on the line, and America\u2019s doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals fighting for our lives at the front lines,\u201d said Peter Navarro, assistant to the President.\u00a0 This first batch of ventilators from GM will be sent to hospitals in Gary, Indiana, and Chicago, according to Navarro. ##Business## ##Health## There are at least\u00a0592,743\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally.

The \u201csolidarity flight\u201d in Africa is \u201cby far the largest single shipment of supplies since the start of the pandemic, and will ensure that people living in countries with some of the weakest health systems are able to get tested and treated, while ensuring health workers on the frontlines are properly protected,\u201d said Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO regional director. WFP planes will transport WHO equipment such as face shields, gloves, goggles, gowns, masks, medical aprons, thermometers and ventilators from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where the regional humanitarian air hub was set up by the WFP this week. One million face masks will be shipped in addition to the personal protective equipment and laboratory supplies, which is expected to \u201cbe enough to protect health workers while treating more than 30,000 patients across the continent,\u201d the statement said.  \u201cThe medical supplies are timely as the continent still has a window of opportunity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in the statement.

But he warned that people must not take their \u201cfoot off the pedal\u201d with social distancing and other measures instated to stop the spread of the virus.  \u201cA reduction in infections rates will then translate into a reduction in new UK cases\u2026our testing has shown a plateauing in the number of new cases we are picking up,\u201d Powis said. While the data shows a plateau in the number of new cases, he conceded that not enough testing is being done in order for a true picture. Deaths from the virus are still increasing and that number is expected to continue to rise, he added.  \u201cThis is number that will reduce last, unfortunately. With sadness, it is the one that will take longest to change. But those benefits from social distancing will eventually translate into a reduction in the number of daily deaths,\" Powis said. ##Health## Dr. James Phillips, a physician and assistant professor at George Washington University Hospital, says reopening the economy by May 1 \"is a pipe dream.\" \"The only way we would open up\u00a0significant parts of the country\u00a0by May 1st is to do so under\u00a0significant risks of the worsening health and the\u00a0potential lives of American\u00a0citizens,\" Phillips told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Phillips said while he agrees the country should be talking about how to restart the economy and get people back to work, there needs to be a plan in place to protect Americans. \"In disaster medicine we talk\u00a0about something called disaster\u00a0cycle, where you start considering the return\u00a0to normal almost immediately\u00a0after the event occurs.\u00a0It is appropriate to start\u00a0talking about this.\u00a0But, we have to have the right\u00a0steps in place before we get\u00a0there,\" Phillips said. Watch: The United States doesn\u2019t have the capacity to test and trace Covid-19 cases \u2014 a key measure the country will need to start the process of reopening, according to the nation\u2019s top infectious disease doctor. \u201cWe have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press. Fauci\u2019s comments come the day after President Trump promised guidelines \u201csoon\u201d aimed at governors to reopen the economy.\u00a0 He added that opening the country on May 1, after federal social distancing guidelines are set to expire, is\u00a0\u201ca bit overly optimistic\u201d for many places in the US. This process, he said, would likely have to occur on a \u201crolling\u201d basis and not simultaneously across the country. A key worry, he said, was that the US would see new outbreaks in places where officials may not be able to swiftly test and trace contacts of those who are infected.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll guarantee you,\u00a0once you start pulling back, there will be infections. It\u2019s how you deal\u00a0with the infections that\u2019s going to count,\u201d Fauci told The Associated Press, adding that we need ways to get people \"out of circulation if they get infected, because once you start getting clusters, then you\u2019re really in trouble.\"\u00a0 These concerns reflect those New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Monday \u2013 that states lack sufficient capacity to test on their own. \"It's not as simple as saying states should test,\u201d Cuomo said. They can't do it without the federal government. There are not enough tests now, and there's not\u00a0enough reagents, and there's not enough medical equipment.\u201d  Referring to other governors joining over the phone from states including Connecticut and New Jersey, he added, \u201cAny one of these governors would tell you ... they don't have the testing\u00a0capacity, and they can't gather it themselves.\u201d Fauci stopped short of telling The Associated Press that a second wave of infection isn\u2019t inevitable but said, \u201cIf you mean it goes way down and then come September, October,\u00a0November,\u00a0we have another peak \u2013 I have to say I would not be surprised.

Travel was to be restricted across the border until at least April 19 but Trudeau said discussions were underway with the Trump administration to extend the border measures. \u201cIn regards to the American border, we recognize that travel restrictions are going to remain extremely important in terms of containing the spread of Covid-19 in Canada and we\u2019re going to continue to work with the Americans and people around the world to ensure that we continue with these restrictions,\u201d Trudeau said. The prime minister also refused to say when the country\u2019s lockdown might end. He added that any reopening of the economy would be phased in and might be different in various parts of the country. \"The reality is it is going to be weeks still. We recognize that it is going to be important to get our economy going and that we are going to have to do it in phases,\u201d Trudeau said. ##Daily Life## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the massive amount of testing needed to assess the coronavirus threat remains a major challenge.\u00a0 \"The capacity does not exist,\" he said.\u00a0 Private-sector companies that perform testing can produce about 60,000 tests per month, Cuomo said, which is \"not enough.\"\u00a0 Cuomo called for government and technology leaders to work together to put together a testing system within a matter of weeks. \"Figure out how to do testing.\u00a0Figure out how to use technology\u00a0to do tracing,\" he said. However, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier today that he is working with an Indiana company to get 50,000 testing kits per week.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo addressed Trump's assertion that the President has \"total authority\" to decide when coronavirus restrictions are lifted. \"That is not an accurate statement in my opinion,\" Cuomo said today at a news conference. Remember: The President does not have \"total\" authority over coronavirus restrictions.\u00a0You can read CNN's full fact check here. Cuomo said he refuses to engage in a fight with Trump, saying, \"This is too important for anyone to play politics.\"  \"If he wants a fight, he's not going to get it from me,\" Cuomo said. Cuomo said that ver the past month he \"worked very hard to be in partnership with the federal government.\" He said he plans to still plans to be in contact with Trump and federal officials. \"I have always had an open line of communication with him,\" he said of Trump. \"I just want to my position clear: I am not going to fight with him.\" Earlier today, Cuomo said he wouldn\u2019t follow a possible order from Trump to ease coronavirus restrictions in the state if it put public health at risk.  Here's what he told CNN this morning: \u201cIf he ordered me to reopen in\u00a0a way that would endanger the\u00a0public health of the people of\u00a0my state, I wouldn't do it,\u201d\u00a0Cuomo said. \u201cThat would\u00a0be the worst possible thing he\u00a0could do at this moment would be\u00a0to act dictatorial and to act in\u00a0a partisan, divisive way.\u201d Watch: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that while shuttered businesses and coronavirus restrictions are hampering the economy and way of life, such measures are necessary to prevent a flareup of new cases.\u00a0 \"People need to get back to work.\u00a0The state needs an economy.\u00a0We cannot\u00a0sustain\u00a0this for a\u00a0prolonged period of time.\u00a0Everybody agrees,\" Cuomo said. \"But everybody will also say how\u00a0you reopen is everything,\u00a0because of the first point, which\u00a0is we are now keeping down that\u00a0rate of infection.\u00a0And if you start acting\u00a0differently, you will see a\u00a0corresponding increase in that\u00a0rate of infection,\" he said.\u00a0 Cuomo also responded to criticism that he is being \"hyper-cautious.\"\u00a0 \"Oh really?\u00a0Go look at other countries that\u00a0went through exactly this,\u00a0started to reopen and then they\u00a0saw the infection rate go back\u00a0up again.\u00a0So let's at least learn from\u00a0past mistakes,\" he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he's working with governors from surrounding states on a plan to reopen the economy because \"the virus doesn't understand state boundaries.\" Cuomo yesterday announced that New York was working with six other northeastern states \u2014 New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts \u2014 on protocols for eventually reopening businesses.  \"The virus doesn't understand state boundaries\" Cuomo said today. \"It defies all of our norms.\" \"We're all connected,\" he added. ##Daily Life## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the growth of coronavirus cases outside of New York City is essentially flat.\u00a0 Hotspots in Long Island, Westchester County and Rockland County have been identified and tamped down by the state Department of Health using testing, isolation and tracing, according to Cuomo.\u00a0 \"Proportionately, upstate is very,\u00a0very low to everything else in\u00a0the state,\" he added. Another 778 people died across New York state from coronavirus yesterday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. That's up from 671 on Sunday.  At least 10,834 people in New York have died from coronavirus since the pandemic began. ##Health## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the three-day average for coronavirus hospitalizations is down slightly, adding that officials believe the apex is here.  \"We think we are at the apex, on the plateau,\" he said at a news conference. However, while the rates are down, the volume of patients coming in daily is still high, Cuomo added. \"We still had 1,600 new people come in yesterday,\" he said. \"The volume is still high.\" Watch: ##Health## New York City will purchase 50,000 coronavirus testing kits per week from Aria Diagnostics, a biotech firm in Indiana, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced this morning. \"The No. 1 issue from day one has been testing. When we started fighting the coronavirus here in the city, I said we needed the federal help with testing \u2014 it never came. We have scoured the world looking for test kits on the open market. It's been extraordinarily frustrating,\" he said. \"I'm sure New Yorkers wouldn't have thought the cavalry would have come from Carmel, Indiana, but it has. It's going to be a big piece of the solution going forward,\" he added. The test kit components include nasal swabs, viral transport medium (VTM), and tubes. This follows a previously announced a donation of 50,000 testing kits for New York City by Aria Diagnostics. ##Health## Italian police issued fines to more than 42,000 people during the Easter weekend for breaking coronavirus containment rules, the Italian Interior Ministry said today. The crackdown occurred\u00a0between Saturday and Monday.  On Monday alone, 16,545 containment fines were given. That's the highest daily number recorded by the Ministry since the lockdown was introduced in Italy in order to combat the coronavirus outbreak.   Italy was the first country outside of mainland China to implement strict restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus, even bringing in military personnel to help enforce those laws.  ##Daily Life## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that, as of Monday, hospitalizations for coronavirus are down, but both positive cases and ICU admissions are up. Here's how he spelled it out in a news conference:\u00a0 At least 326 people were admitted to hospitals on Monday for Covid-19, down from 383 the day before.\nAt least 850 people were in NYC Health\u00a0+ Hospitals ICU units for suspected Covid-19, up from 835 the day before. NYC Health\u00a0+ Hospitals is made up of 11 facilities and says it's the \u201clargest public health care system in the United States.\"\nCitywide, the percentage of people tested who are positive for Covid-19 59.6%, up from 58.1% the day before. At Public Health Lab, it's 84%, up 78.4% the day before. ##Health## President Trump has responded to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who told CNN this morning he would refuse and legally challenge a potential order from the President to reopen the state's economy if doing so would put its residents at risk of being exposed to Covid-19.\u00a0 Trump tweeted that Cuomo has been \u201cbegging for everything,\u201d and now \u201cseems to want independence.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cCuomo\u2019s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state\u2019s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc.,\u201d the President wrote. \u201cI got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won't happen!\" Trump tweeted. Some background: Trump told reporters yesterday that he had \u201ctotal authority\u201d to reopen state economies after coronavirus closures. Legal experts say that isn't supported by the Constitution. Cuomo, whose state is currently seeing the effectiveness of its restrictions as the number of cases there begin to level off, said a \"dictatorial\" and \"partisan\" order from Trump to reopen New York's economy \"would be the worst possible thing he could do at this moment.\" Cuba's second group of medical personnel landed in Turin, Italy, today at the request of Italian authorities and Italy's Ministry of Health.  Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio tweeted about the arrival, calling it \"good news.\" The medical team left Cuba yesterday, arriving in Turin, the regional capital of Piedmont this morning. Piedmont's Governor Alberto Cirio expressed his deep appreciation for the team's arrival on his Facebook page.  \"To support our doctors and nurses, who have been fighting relentlessly for weeks, today a team of operators specialized in emergencies has arrived from Cuba... They will stay in Piedmont for as long as necessary. Our heartfelt thanks to Cuba for this gesture of great solidarity and friendship.\"\u00a0 Italy is not the only country to seek help from Cuba during this pandemic.  Cuban health care \"brigades\" have received recent invitations from Italy, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Suriname, Jamaica and Grenada as those systems are strained to the point of collapse due to the coronavirus.  The first group\u00a0of\u00a0Cuban medical\u00a0workers\u00a0sent to help Italy\u00a0landed on March 22 and have been working there ever since. ##Health##  The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized a saliva test for diagnosing Covid-19 in emergencies.  Rutgers University, where the test was developed in collaboration with other groups, announced the FDA authorization today after formally receiving it over the weekend. What this means: Using saliva to diagnose novel coronavirus infections could expand testing capacities across the United States. So far, testing for Covid-19 has usually involved nose or throat swabs. \"It\u00a0means we no longer have to put health care professionals at risk for infection by performing nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal collections,\"\u00a0Andrew Brooks,\u00a0chief operating officer and director of technology development at the university's RUCDR Infinite Biologics lab, said in a news release.\u00a0 According to Rutgers University's news release, this is the first such saliva test to receive emergency use authorization from the FDA.\u00a0Brooks, a professor at the university, called the impact of the authorization \"significant.\" Across the United States, which has faced a shortage of tests, several other laboratories have been working on developing saliva tests and other types of diagnostic testing for Covid-19.\u00a0 So far during the coronavirus pandemic, the FDA has worked with more than 300 test developers who have said they plan to submit emergency use authorization requests to the agency for their diagnostic tests, the agency announced on Monday. According to the FDA, 34 emergency-use authorizations have been issued for diagnostic tests to date. ##Health## At least 12,107 people have died from coronavirus in the UK\u2019s hospitals, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health and Social Care. That\u2019s an increase of 778 since the last update. The figures are current as of 5 p.m. local time yesterday.  Remember: It only includes those who died in hospital. These numbers do not include the people who died in nursing homes or elsewhere.\u00a0 Other figures released by the UK\u2019s Office of National Statistics on today suggest the true death toll is significantly higher than the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s tally because there can be a lag in recording some deaths. The department says at least 93,873 people have tested positive to coronavirus. ##Health## Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan extended a \"partial lockdown\" across the country until the end of April.\u00a0\u00a0 In a nationally televised briefing today, Khan called for Pakistanis to stay indoors to ensure that the country continues to flattened the curve.\u00a0 To manage the surge of unemployment in the country, the government will reopen the construction sector in phases to ensure employment for daily wage earners in the country.  Domestic and international travel by rail and air will remain closed until the end of the month.  ##Daily Life## US stocks climbed higher at the opening bell as better-than-expected trade data from China\u00a0lifted investors' hopes that the world's second-largest economy may be starting to bounce back. Meanwhile, first-quarter earnings season got underway with the big banks reporting. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both reported\u00a0substantial\u00a0losses and shored up their reserves to prevent more pain during the coronavirus recession.\u00a0But that was widely expected, and their shares climbed 3% and 2%, respectively, at the market open\u00a0 The Dow kicked off 1.6%, or 385 points, higher.\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.8%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.9%. \u00a0You can follow live updates on the markets here. ##Business## Boston University is preparing for the possibility that in-person classes may not resume until 2021. The university has already cancelled all \"in-person summer activities on the Charles River Campus\" \u2014 and the school's coronavirus recovery plan includes protocols for if it's not safe for students to return to campus in the fall. Boston University explained it like this in an online statement: \"The Recovery Plan recognizes that if, in the unlikely event that public health officials deem it unsafe to open in the fall of 2020, then the University\u2019s contingency plan envisions the need to consider a later in-person return, perhaps in January 2021.\" The University will \"offer remote learning courses this summer\" and it plans to \"continue providing the minimal housing and dining services that are currently available.\" The White House is expected to announce a new task force \u2013 or multiple task forces \u2013 to deal with reopening the US economy after coronavirus closures. Here\u2019s what we know about the possible group so far: As of yesterday, membership had not been finalized: The White House said the composition of the new panel isn't finalized yet. The President has described the task force members as, \u201cThe best names in various businesses and professions and religions.\u201d\nWe know one member for sure: It'll be President Trump\u2019s new chief of staff Mark Meadows.\nThere could be governors and business leaders: The President and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have teased that there will be key figures from the private sector and governor. There's no indication yet on who that would be and\u00a0it's not a done deal yet.\nDetails are changing: One official tells CNN the details have already changed several times in recent days. No one wants to go out on a limb about the council\u2019s composition until President Trump has given final sign off.\nIt\u2019s increasingly unlikely that CEOs will play a formal role: A source who regularly advises CEOs is casting doubt on the notion that CEOs or business leaders have been asked to join a formal White House task force to reopen the economy.\nJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump will NOT serve on the task force: President Trump was asked during Monday\u2019s briefing if either of them would serve, and he said no, despite reporting that the President\u2019s daughter would play a role.\nThere could be multiple task forces: \u201cWe\u2019re actually calling it a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields, and we\u2019ll be announcing them tomorrow,\u201d President Trump said at Monday\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing. \u00a0##Business## The British economy could shrink by 35% in the second quarter if there is three months' worth of restrictions, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), UK\u2019s independent public finances watchdog, warned.  The OBR predicted the economy will eventually bounce back, leading to an annual drop in GDP of 13%. The watchdog said in a report that this is just a potential scenario: \u201cWe do not attempt to predict how long the economic lockdown will last \u2013 that is a matter for the Government, informed by medical advice,\u201d it said. A three-month lockdown \u2014 followed by another three-month period where movement restrictions are eased \u2014 would see unemployment rise by more than 2 million to 10% in the second quarter, OBR said.   The watchdog added the deficit would hit \u00a3273 billion in 2020-21 or 14% of GDP, before falling back close to forecast in the medium term. That would be the largest single-year deficit since the Second World War. ##Business## At least 589 sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for Covid-19, according to a US Navy official. One sailor died earlier this week, and four have been hospitalized. Some background: The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Roosevelt was at the center of a controversy that led to\u00a0the resignation last week\u00a0of acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly, who had dismissed the aircraft carrier's captain Brett Crozier\u00a0after the leak of a memo\u00a0in which he implored Navy officials to urgently evacuate the ship to protect the health of its sailors.  Crozier also flagged his concerns about challenges of trying to contain the virus aboard the ship and requested that sailors be allowed to quarantine on land. ##Health## Wells Fargo just announced a\u00a0deeper-than-expected 89% plunge\u00a0in first-quarter profit, driven largely by\u00a0a\u00a0$3.1 billion reserve build\u00a0to protect against bad loans. The reserve build\u00a0\"reflected the expected impact these unprecedented times could have on our customers,\"\u00a0Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry said in a statement. Wells Fargo's provision for credit losses spiked to nearly $4 billion, compared with $845 million the year before.  Here's why: The bank cited\u00a0\"forecasted credit deterioration due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\" Revenue dropped 18% to $17.7 billion, also missing estimates. Wells Fargo reported a 5% jump in period-end loans to $1 trillion. That growth could accelerate this quarter because the Federal Reserve\u00a0recently removed penalties on Wells Fargo\u00a0to free the troubled bank to lend to small businesses. Deposits also climbed 4% to $1.4 trillion. ##Business## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that easing coronavirus restrictions and opening up more businesses across the state will likely take months.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0not talking about the next two\u00a0weeks or three weeks, we're\u00a0talking about months, we're\u00a0talking about a phased reopening,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota.\u00a0\u201cIt means there is no light\u00a0switch.\u00a0 He continued: \"It\u2019s going to be a phased\u00a0process.\u00a0We have to bring in testing, so\u00a0that we\u2019re testing as we're doing\u00a0this reopening, so that we can gauge whether or\u00a0not we're increasing the virus\u00a0spread.\u00a0We have to start with really\u00a0what's an expansion of essential\u00a0services.\u201d Cuomo said coronavirus cases over the past five days or so seem to have plateaued in the state.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur behavior has stopped the\u00a0spread of the virus.\u00a0God did not stop the spread of\u00a0the virus.\u00a0And what we do, how we act, will\u00a0dictate how that virus spreads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe changed the\u00a0trajectory of the virus by our\u00a0actions.\u00a0And that's the real important\u00a0lesson to me,\u201d he added. Cuomo again cautioned that easing coronavirus restrictions too soon could have potentially disastrous results. \u201cI want to get out of the house, trust me.\u00a0Everybody does.\u00a0But if you move too\u00a0quickly and not smartly, you\u00a0will see the numbers go right\u00a0back up again and you'll have to\u00a0do another lockdown,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe federal government has\u00a0to be realistic about this.\u00a0You can't just wish it and then\u00a0it is so.\u201d Watch more: ##Daily Life## There\u2019ll be no decision until Thursday on whether to extend the UK\u2019s coronavirus restrictions, the Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesperson said.\u00a0 He said the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) will discuss social distancing rules at its meeting today, which the government will then consider.\u00a0 The spokesperson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson will continue to rest at the countryside retreat, Chequers, as he recovers from coronavirus.

And do health care systems have enough capacity to cope if case numbers were to rise again? The plan calls for an exit strategy based on science, coordinated between member states with \"respect and solidarity.\"  It says a successful exit strategy would also be dependent on measures being met, including an expanded coronavirus testing capacity to measure contagion and the population's immunity, along with a \"harmonized\" and \"robust\" system for contact tracing.\u00a0\u00a0 It notes that the exit should be gradual, starting at local levels. Gatherings of people should also be permitted gradually and economic activity should be \"phased in.\" \"Once the exit phase is successfully entered, the next phase would be the recovery, in which the economy needs to pick up pace and get back on a growth path,\" the four-page document concludes.\u00a0 \"What we have been working on over the past weeks is a roadmap with recommendations, to ensure that when they start to move out of these restrictive measures, they do so in a manner which is effective,\" Mamer said. He added that this includes, in particular, \"taking into account obviously the situation in other EU countries and \u2026 in particular in neighbor countries.\u201d Mamer said the Commission would be making recommendations as to \"what we believe are the main criteria which member states should use when they are taking these decisions.\" \u201cWe are not going to going to be saying to any specific member state: \u2018This is now the right point in time for you to start taking measures to ease the restrictions you have in place\u2019. This is really a decision for member states,\" Mamer said. \u201cWhat we are going to be recommending is a series of criteria and conditions that we think should apply when assessing and ultimately deciding whether it makes sense to start to ease the measures.\u201d At least 3,022 US service members have tested positive for Covid-19.

Farm workers are in fear. It's hard to get groceries. Health professionals -- doctors, nurses and everyone down the line -- are the rightful and obvious heroes of the pandemic, but if this dark episode has taught us anything about the way we live today, it could be that our society rests on the backs of a lot of people who cannot simply stay home and chill while the coronavirus blows through. Food workers are frontline workers too: You probably saw the headline recently that one of the largest hog processing plants in the country had ceased production for the foreseeable future. The reason? Employees at the plant, a Smithfield operation, account for about half of the coronavirus cases in South Dakota. Similar closures have hit plants in Pennsylvania and Iowa and the CEO of Smithfield said\u00a0the country's meat supply is at risk.

The 98 new deaths he announced bring Iran's death toll from coronavirus to 4,683. On Monday, Iran reported 1,617 new cases, and 111 new deaths. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in England is significantly higher than the British Government has reported in its daily updates, according to new data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The daily updates from the Department of Health and Social Care only include people who have died with coronavirus in hospitals, and not those who have died in nursing homes or other locations. They are also affected by a lag in reporting times. But more complete data, released weekly by the ONS, records all deaths where coronavirus is registered on the death certificate \u2013 regardless of whether a person died in or out of hospital. According to the ONS, the number of coronavirus-related deaths that occurred up to April 3 in England was 5,979. The comparative daily update released the following day by the UK Government reported 3,939 deaths in England. The ONS number represents an increase of 52% on the figures initially reported for that period. Confusion in UK death toll reporting: The disparity highlights the murkiness of Britain's recorded death rates during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of people who had died by April 3 has now been reported as three different figures. The first number -- 3,939 -- was revised upwards by the government on April 12, to 5,186. This was likely done because deaths can often take several days to record, so initial numbers effectively understate the true figure. Now, the ONS figure -- registered on April 11 and released on Tuesday -- has added the deaths which occurred outside of hospitals to the total, resulting in an even higher number. The newest ONS number is a 15% rise on the updated government figure, and a 52% on the initial government figure. Such confusion means that making direct comparisons between the UK's coronavirus curve and those of other European nations is difficult. But the numbers clearly highlight that the UK's headline figures for daily coronavirus deaths -- which already amount to the fourth-highest total in Europe -- are understated, and the true number can be significantly higher than the numbers revealed each day by ministers. \"Older people's lives are not worth less\": The conflicting data sets have also prompted calls for the government to include deaths in care homes when they announce the new figures each day. A number of leading British charities released a joint letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Monday demanding a \"daily update on coronavirus deaths in the care system, just like deaths in the NHS, so that as a society we can understand the scale of the challenge we face.\" \"Older people\u2019s lives are not worth less. Care home staff are not second class carers,\" the charities said. \"The Government must step in and make it clear that no-one will be abandoned to this virus simply because of their age, condition or where they live.\" Spain recorded a slight rise in daily deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday -- 567 over the past 24 hours -- according to Spanish Health Ministry data. It is an increase from the 517 reported on Monday, but remains the third-lowest daily rise in the past three weeks. The total number of deaths from coronavirus in Spain stands at 18,056. However, Spain also recorded a fall of 299 active cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total down to 86,981.\u00a0The decrease suggests the number of new \"recovered\" patients and the dead are outnumbering the increase in new cases.\u00a0 This fall in the numbers of active Covid-19 cases is the first recorded in Europe\u2019s coronavirus \u201chotspots\u201d -- Italy, Spain, France and the UK \u2013 since the pandemic began. Spain has now reached an accumulated total of 172,541 coronavirus cases since the start of the outbreak This post has been corrected to reflect that the fall in active cases recorded in Spain on Tuesday is the first such reduction in the European countries hardest hit by the pandemic. Some shops and business in Italy will be allowed to reopen on Tuesday, according to a government decree signed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, as the country tentatively seeks to emerge from its coronavirus lockdown.  Among the stores permitted to reopen are book shops, laundries, stationery shops and clothing stores for babies and children.\u00a0However, some regions have decided to delay lifting restrictions. The measures will be in place until May 3, according to the government decree. The government has also expanded the list of permitted production activities to allow some forestry, landscape care and maintenance and hydraulic works to resume. Computer manufacturers and wholesalers of paper and cardboard products can restart production.  These openings are in effect a preview of the larger scale openings expected to take place during \u201cPhase 2\u201d of Italy's three-phase plan to bring the country back to normal.  Phase 2 will only start sometime after other lockdown measures are lifted, at some point after May 3.  This week's easing of the lockdown \u201cis not phase 2\u201d, Gianni Rezza, Director of Infectious Diseases at the National Health Institute (ISS), said in a press briefing Monday evening.  The death rate and the epidemic curve in Italy show \u201cpositive signals that need to be consolidated in time,\u201d he said. In Lombardy and Veneto, the regions hardest hit by the pandemic, book stores and stationery shops are not allowed to reopen. In Lazio, the region including Rome, book stores will be allowed to open from April 20 \u201cto give time to the owners to organize security measures,\u201d such as guaranteeing minimum distances between people, providing disposable gloves at shop entrances and promoting the sanitation of the premises. The new decree says anywhere that reopens to the public must respect the rules, for example making hand sanitizer available, enforcing the use of masks in enclosed spaces, and in areas where distancing cannot be guaranteed, and the use of disposable gloves in the purchase of food and drink. Access to shops will be staggered to ensure the social distancing of customers. India is considering relaxing its shutdown rules in parts of the country with low numbers of coronavirus cases, following a review of the situation in individual states since the country went into nationwide lockdown. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country's current 21-day nationwide lockdown would be extended until May 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Modi said every district and state across the country will be evaluated in terms of restrictions being followed until April 20, calling it a \u201clitmus test.\u201d\u00a0 Areas that succeed and are less likely to turn into a hotspot could then be allowed to open up certain activities, he said.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, keep in mind, this permission will be conditional and the rules for going out will be very strict. Permission will be withdrawn immediately if lockdown rules are broken and the spread of coronavirus risked,\u201d he warned. The government will provide \u201cdetailed guidelines\u201d on the plan on Wednesday. Several states have already set up hundreds of \u201ccontainment zones\u201d in areas that have seen a concentration of cases.\u00a0\u00a0 Modi expressed his concerns over cases spreading into new areas. \"A single new patient at even the smallest local level should be a matter of concern for us,\" he said. \u201cTherefore, we have to be very vigilant about hotspots ... the creation of new hotspots will further challenge our hard work,\u201d Modi added. On Tuesday the number of confirmed cases in India crossed the 10,000 mark, reaching 10,363. At least 339 people have died. On Monday, the country reported it had conducted 206,212 COVID-19 tests. China will lift \u201chealth management\u201d restrictions on African nationals following a meeting with representatives from 20 African countries, according to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u00a0\u00a0 The change of policy comes after several African countries complained about the treatment of their citizens, following reports of alleged coronavirus-related discrimination\u00a0against African nationals in China and particularly in the city of Guangzhou. African students and expatriates in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou were last week subject to forced coronavirus testing and arbitrary 14-day self-quarantine, regardless of recent travel history, amid heightened fears of imported infections. Large numbers of African nationals\u00a0were also left homeless, after being evicted by their landlords and rejected by hotels in the city. China says the lifting of restrictions will not apply to those who are confirmed to have Covid-19, or those who have been in close contact with people who have tested positive. Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong spoke at the meeting and said Chinese people have always regarded the African people as partners and brothers,\u00a0and that the China-Africa friendship is deeply rooted and unbreakable. China has denied the discrimination accusations about\u00a0African nationals since Sunday.\u00a0Chen, along with\u00a0Guangzhou\u2019s director of foreign affairs\u00a0Zhao Lijian, have both said that the \"Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally.\"\u00a0 According to a statement from the Chinese government, African representatives expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Chinese side to prevent and control the epidemic situation. A total of 1.4 million people in the UK have claimed welfare support since the coronavirus pandemic began, the country's Work and Pensions Secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey said.  Coffey said the figure included those who\u2019d applied for help under the government\u2019s \"universal credit\" scheme, job seeker\u2019s allowance, or employment support allowance. \u201cWe are capable of processing and managing those claims,\u201d Coffey told Sky News. She also said that the country\u2019s welfare safety net is \u201cproperly functioning.\" \u201cPeople will start to receive financial support -- if they haven\u2019t already had an advance,\" said Coffey. ##Business## ##Daily Life## Germany is showing some positive trends in its bid to stop Covid-19 from continuing to spread, the head of the Robert Koch Institute -- the country's national agency for disease control and prevention -- said at a news conference Tuesday. \"We have some positive trends, citizens have helped here. I thank everyone. It is great that our efforts are showing results,\" said Lothar Wieler.   But he warned that there was no clear sign that the numbers of infections were decreasing. Wieler also said there were strong regional differences in Germany and advised citizens to remain disciplined. Germany's cases top 125,000: Another 2,082 coronavirus infections were reported by the Robert Koch Institute on Tuesday, bringing the national total to 125,098. The total includes 2,969 deaths. ##Health## One third of National Health Service staff and other key workers who\u2019ve been tested for coronavirus have returned positive results, according to data released by the British government. According to the figures released Monday, 16,888 people who fall into the category of \u201ckey workers and their households\u201d have been tested. So far, 5,733 \u2013 or 34% -- are confirmed to have the virus. The government has been under pressure to ramp up testing for NHS workers and their families, amid concerns about a lack of appropriate personal protective equipment.  Health minister Matt Hancock has previously said that NHS staff who show symptoms -- or live with someone who does -- will be able to get tested under the government\u2019s plan, with the ultimate goal to provide testing to all NHS staff regardless of symptoms. \u00a0##Health## Here's the latest on the coronavirus pandemic. Global cases are closing in on 2 million: The novel coronavirus has infected at least 1,921,369 people and killed 119,730 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. \nNearly another month of lockdown for India: Prime Minister\u00a0Narendra Modi\u00a0has extended a nationwide lockdown\u00a0until May 3 in a bid to contain the continued spread of the\u00a0coronavirus, but said that some states which have avoided outbreaks may be allowed to resume \"important activities.\" The \"complete\" 21-day lockdown for India's 1.3 billion people came into force at the end of the day on March 24 and was set to expire today.\nGloomy economic outlook for France: The economy is expected to shrink by 8% this year, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said. France is extending coronavirus emergency measures until May 11, President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday.\nSingapore's biggest spike: The Southeast Asian city-state reported 386 new cases on Monday -- all locally transmitted. It's the largest single-day increase since the outbreak began in the country, according to the Ministry of Health.\nPositive signs in the United States: Though the situation differs from state to state, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the country is \"nearing the peak right now.\" Cases in the US have topped 582,000, including more than 23,000 deaths.\nNew York preparing for what's next: New York Gov.

Cuomo said the state is looking at a plan to reopen after the shutdown that is in coordination with other surrounding states.\nHeated briefing: President Donald Trump\u00a0lashed out at criticism of his handling of the\u00a0coronavirus crisis\u00a0during a grievance-fueled appearance from the White House that featured a propaganda-like video he said was produced by his aides. \"Everything we did was right,\" Trump insisted.  French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said the country's economy is expected to shrink by 8% this year. \"Certain sectors such as hotels and restaurants will not be able to resume from May 11 for reasons of health security; partial unemployment will be prolonged,\" he said. The prediction comes on the heels of President Emmanuel Macron's announcement Monday night that France would extended coronavirus emergency measures for another month. In a live address to the nation, Macron said the strict measures will remain in place and the borders will be closed until May 11.\u00a0 ##Business## Acting US Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell on Monday shared a meme that appeared to mock the enforcement of\u00a0stay-at-home orders\u00a0in the US despite the overwhelming consensus of public health officials that such measures are crucial to slowing the coronavirus' spread. On his\u00a0Instagram\u00a0account, Grenell posted the meme that features an image of the US Constitution with the caption \"signed permission slip to leave your house.\" \"Love this!\" Grenell captioned the post. That message directly contradicts recommendations put forth by public health experts and government agencies -- including Grenell's own office. Read more about the post here: ##Daily Life## As the world watches and wonders when coronavirus pandemic stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures might end, some hope antibody tests might help provide a solution. Antibody tests -- also known as serology tests -- aren't meant to diagnose active infection with the coronavirus. Rather, they check for proteins in the immune system, known as antibodies, through a blood sample.  Their presence means a person was exposed to the virus and developed antibodies against it, which may mean they have at least some immunity -- although experts are not sure how strong the immunity may be or even how long it will last. In contrast, diagnostic testing, so far, has mostly used a laboratory technique known as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. These tests can diagnose active infections through a sample -- usually from a nose swab -- that is\u00a0then tested for viral genetic material.

The IMF trust responsible for the funds can provide $500 million in \"grant-based debt service relief.\" In her statement, Georgieva urged donors \"to help us replenish the Trust\u2019s resources and boost further our ability to provide additional debt service relief for a full two years to our poorest member countries.\u201d ##Business## In a normal year, China would have sold more than 6 million new cars by now. This year, the number is closer to 3.7 million, and now the government is handing out cash to help the\u00a0world's biggest auto market\u00a0get back on its feet after the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. Car sales declined 42% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to last year, according to data released late last week by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  While that is largely because of a whopping 79% plunge in February -- when the country of 1.4 billion people recorded just 310,000 sales -- the market remains very weak. Only 1.43 million vehicles were sold in China last month, a 43% decline over March 2019. Crucial economic role: More than 40 million people in China rely on the auto sector for jobs, either directly or indirectly. And the more than $1 trillion in revenue the industry generates each year contributes to nearly 10% of China's manufacturing sector. A healthy Chinese car market is also important to the rest of the world. Global automakers like\u00a0Volkswagen and\u00a0General Motors\u00a0sell millions of cars in China -- each of those companies, for example, depend on the country for roughly 40% of their total sales.

In one of the most unchained presidential tantrums ever captured on television, Trump's Monday display flouted every notion of calm leadership by the commander in chief in a crisis. He claimed powers never envisioned by the Constitution and insisted his \"authority is total\" to order states and cities to get moving again to break out of the frozen economy. His warning came as two blocs of Eastern and Western hot-spot states banded together in an implied challenge to his vow to get people back to work soon, setting off a brewing confrontation over the power of the federal government. During the news conference, Trump moaned that the press was not giving him credit because \"everything we did was right\" in the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. Raging at reporters, the President used the campaign-style video to mislead the nation about his sluggish recognition of the threat from the virus, after once predicting a \"miracle\" that would make it go away. He called up his top medical adviser,\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, to publicly repudiate his own words Sunday on CNN, which had been interpreted as criticism of early administration actions. When the Category Five presidential storm had blown out, Trump had offered no new guidance on the key issues -- for instance, the continued inadequacy of testing, which will hamper the nation's economic opening. He vowed that the economy would fire up \"ahead of schedule\" but did not explain how, when many states are at or are approaching their peak infection rates. And he appeared to warn he would try to force open state economies, including shops, schools and restaurants closed by governors and mayors. He did not explain, either, how he would convince the public to get back to normal if people did not feel confident they were safe. \"The President of the United States calls the shots,\" Trump said.

The carrier, which left on its current deployment in November, will complete what the Navy calls the \u201csustainment\u201d phase of its operation at sea, the officials said. Sustainment, during which the ship can quickly get underway to respond to any emergency, is normally conducted pierside, so sailors can get some time ashore with families and friends. \u201cThe Navy is taking this measure to maintain the strike group\u2019s warfighting capability while ensuring the safety of the crew,\u201d the Navy statement said.\n\u201cIn the face of COVID-19, we need to protect our most valuable asset, our people, by keeping the ship out to sea,\u201d Vice Adm.

The suit was filed Monday in the US District Court for the Central District of California by the Dhillon Law Group, which is led by Harmeet Dhillion -- a Republican Party official -- on behalf of four plaintiffs, three of whom are pastors. The plaintiffs include: Dean Moffatt, a pastor at an Indio church who alleges he was fined $1,000 for holding a church service on Palm Sunday\nBrenda Wood, a pastor at a Riverside church\nPatrick Scales, a pastor at a Fontana church\nWendy Gish, a member of Scales\u2019 church The group argues in the suit that Newsom and other state officials \u201cin a gross abuse of their power, have seized the coronavirus pandemic to expand their authority by unprecedented lengths, depriving plaintiffs and all other residents of California of fundamental rights protected by the US and California Constitutions, including freedom of religion, speech, and assembly, and due process and equal protection under the law.\u201d Newsom\u2019s office did not immediately return a CNN request for comment. The church leaders in the lawsuit are also suing state Attorney General Xavier Becerra and several Riverside and San Bernardino county officials, including the sheriffs and health officers. Orders ignored: On March 19, Newsom issued the first statewide stay-home order in the US, urging California\u2019s nearly 40 million residents to remain home to reduce the spread of the virus, and closing all non-essential businesses. Despite the orders, some congregations have continued to meet, including in Sacramento County, where 71 people connected to a single church were later infected with the coronavirus in one of the largest outbreak clusters in the country. Electronic worship: The suit comes after Dhillon sent a letter last week to San Bernardino County officials demanding it loosen restrictions around church gatherings following its order that all religious ceremonies be held electronically. Violating the order was punishable by a $1,000 fine or up to 90 days imprisonment. But after the letter, the county issued a \u201cclarification\u201d allowing for in-person church services \u201cif they choose to do so and make every effort to prevent contact between congregants.\u201d\u00a0 Praying safely: On Friday, Newsom also addressed church gatherings ahead of Easter, saying those planning to worship could continue to do so in a safe manner.\u00a0\u201cAs you pray, move your feet at least six feet apart from someone else,\u201d he said. \u201cPractice your faith, but so in a way that allows you to keep yourself healthy, keep others healthy.\u201d ##Health## ##Business## ##Daily Life## Authorities in New Zealand have extended the country's state of national emergency for another seven days in order to support the government's efforts to combat the spread of Covid-19.

The creator of an influential coronavirus model, Dr. Christopher Murray, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday that the country can essentially stop coronavirus transmission this summer. \u201cThe one thing we absolutely know for sure is that social distancing measures work,\u201d said Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \u201cIt leads to a situation where every case is infecting less than one other case, and that means if you keep the course, you\u2019ll get transmission essentially down to zero.\u201d Murray said that\u2019s happening in Italy and China and there\u2019s \u201cno reason it wouldn\u2019t work here.\u201d Murray\u2019s model, which is often cited by the White House, assumes that social distancing will continue through May. But experts have pushed back on the model\u2019s assumption that states can prevent any resurgence of the virus once those measures are lifted.\u00a0 Watch his interview below:  ##Health## Public health authorities in China recorded 89 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Monday, the country's National Health Commission reported. The new cases raise the mainland China total to 82,249. The death toll remains at 3,341. A total of 77,738 people have been discharged from hospital, authorities said. All but three of the new cases recorded Monday were imported from other countries, according to the NHC. \u00a0##Health## Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed several executive orders Monday, ordering several types of businesses to remain closed to the public for the time being. The orders will impact restaurants -- which are limited to carry-out and delivery orders only -- bars, gyms, theaters, casinos and other places of \"public accommodation,\" and will remain in place until April 30.  \"By extending these Executive Orders, we ensure that our state continues to do all it can to suppress the spread of COVID-19 by limiting in-person interactions and services as much as possible right now, while also ensuring that vital goods and supplies get to the people who need them most as quickly and safely as possible,\" Whitmer said in a statement. Whitmer's office also announced an executive order tasking the Michigan Liquor Control Commission with\u00a0initiating a spirits\u00a0buy-back program, in the hopes it would offer financial relief to bars and restaurants. \u201cMichigan\u2019s 8,500 on-premises liquor licensees continue to make unprecedented sacrifices to help slow the spread of COVID-19 across our state,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cThis buy-back program will help our bars and restaurants critical to Michigan\u2019s economy weather the storm through this challenging time in our history.\u201d ##Business## ##Daily Life## The New York Fire Department has reported no new cases of Covid-19 today -- the first time that's happened since the pandemic hit the city, according to spokesman Jim Long. New York City has been one of the hardest-hit places in the United States. More than 100,000 people have been infected there, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, and at least 7,349\u00a0people have died. FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said\u00a0during an interview with television station NY1 that about 650 members of the department have Covid-19 right now. That number doesn't include people that have gone back to work who previously tested positive for the virus.\u00a0 \u201cSome of our members have been sick with the virus themselves and got well and have come back to work to serve the city, serve the people of the city. I\u2019m really incredibly proud of them,\u201d Nigro said. \n\u201cMore people right now have gone back to work each day than go out sick.\" ##Health## It's just after lunchtime at a central Seoul market and a crowd in hot pink jackets is gathering. Pink is the color of the country's main opposition party, the conservative United Future Party, and this crowd of supporters is staging a legal campaign rally ahead of Wednesday's election of 300 members of the National Assembly. Large public gatherings are a jarring sight\u00a0during a pandemic. But South Korea has never postponed an election -- and the coronavirus is not stopping this one. Like many democracies around the world, South Korea has been faced with a predicament: how to hold an election during a pandemic without spreading the virus. At least\u00a047 countries\u00a0have postponed elections due to the coronavirus\u00a0outbreak, including Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, France and Ethiopia. Others, like the United States and New Zealand, are still deciding whether to proceed with their scheduled votes.

Abdullah said that the country is using two to 10 times more PPE than usual and asked that nongovernmental organizations donate equipment, according to the country's state-run Bernama News Agency. He said the country has enough ventilators. \u201cWhat is important is that we have to continue to procure the PPE. So far, we have enough to last for at\u00a0least\u00a0another\u00a0two weeks,\u201d\u00a0he said. ##Health## Singapore reported 386 new cases of novel coronavirus on Monday. It's the largest single-day increase since the outbreak began in the country, according to the Ministry of Health. This brings the country's total to 2,918, with all the new cases identified as locally transmitted cases, the ministry said. Among the new cases, 280 have been linked to known clusters, of which the vast majority are foreign workers residing in dormitories. Twelve others are linked to existing cases, while 94 are pending contact tracing. Meanwhile, a 65-year-old man died of complications resulting from coronavirus on Monday, bringing the national death toll to nine. ##Health## President Donald Trump lashed out at criticism of his handling of the coronavirus crisis during a grievance-fueled appearance from the White House. The appearance only affirmed the impression that some of Trump's chief concerns amid the global public health disaster are how his performance is viewed in the media and whether he's being fairly judged. He clearly did not believe that was the case Monday. He stepped to the podium armed with a video meant to frame his response in a positive light after his initial handling of the crisis has come under increasing scrutiny. After it aired, Trump grew increasingly irate as reporters probed the time line of his response, claiming the criticism wasn't fair and that he'd handled the outbreak effectively. \"Everything we did was right,\" Trump insisted after an extended tirade against negative coverage. Pressed later about his\u00a0authority\u00a0to reopen parts of the country, Trump delivered an eyebrow-raising statement asserting absolute control over the country. \"When somebody is president of the United States, your\u00a0authority\u00a0is total,\" he said.  He later added he would issue reports backing up his claim, which legal experts say isn't supported by the Constitution.

So the Census, we are\u00a0going to be asking for a delay, a major\u00a0delay,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Trump said that the Census Bureau will ask Congress for a 120 day extension -- an extension he feels is not long enough. \u201cIn addition as millions of Americans continue\u00a0to complete their questionnaire online,\u00a0the Census Bureau asked Congress\u00a0for a 120 day extension.\u00a0I don't know if you even have to ask\u00a0them.\u00a0This is called an act of God.\u00a0This is called a situation that\u00a0has to be -- they have to give\u00a0it and I think 120 days isn't\u00a0nearly enough,\u201d Trump said. Why the Census Bureau is asking for an extension: The late revisions to the census data collection timeline means officials need more time to compile the data that is used to apportion members of Congress among the states, as well as the data that states use to draw congressional districts.\u00a0 Federal law requires some of that data be compiled before the end of this year, so being granted the extension would allow the final counts to be delivered to the President in April and July of 2021. Watch: ##Business## Responding to criticism of his administration's response to the coronavirus, President Donald Trump touted his decision to limit travel from areas which had more coronavirus cases than the US at the time. Trump told reporters Monday, \"I did a ban on China, you think that was easy? Then I did a ban on Europe and many said it was an incredible thing to do.\" Asked later about whether he\u2019d be willing to lift travel restrictions as part of opening up the country, Trump added, \u201cRight now we have a very strong ban. We will keep it that way until they heal.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0It's misleading to call the travel restrictions Trump announced against China and Europe a ban because they contained multiple exemptions. Only foreign nationals who had been in China, Europe's Schengen area, the UK or Ireland within the past 14 days are outright banned from entering the US. As of\u00a0February 2, US citizens who had been in China's Hubei province in the two weeks prior to their return to the United States are subject to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days upon their return to the US. American citizens returning from the rest of mainland China may also face up to 14 days of quarantine after undergoing health screenings at selected ports of entry.\u00a0 The broader\u00a0European travel suspension\u00a0Trump announced on March 11 applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders without being subjected to border checks. While Trump initially identified the United Kingdom as exempt, additional countries that are not in the Schengen area and thus also exempt from the restrictions include Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Armenia, Montenegro, Belarus and Russia. As of March 14, the ban was\u00a0expanded\u00a0to include foreign nationals traveling from the UK and Ireland. The restrictions also did not apply to US citizens returning from Europe as well as permanent US residents and certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents.

The report says the Italian cluster \"showed worse clinical outcomes\" in elderly males with previous health conditions, resembling the most at risk patients in Wuhan. According to the institute, the initial reproduction number or R0 -- the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person -- was 2.96 in the northern region of Lombardy, one of the most affected. The study says that by mid-February, the R0 had edged up slightly to three. Silvio Brusaferro, head of the ISS had said during his weekly briefing that R0 levels should ideally be below one to flatten the Covid-19 curve.\u00a0 \"Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed. Overall Rt (the virus' transmission rate at a given time) in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures,\" the report says. ##Health##"], "Language": false}
