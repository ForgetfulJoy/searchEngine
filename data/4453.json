Plan A and Plan B each required two holes to be drilled - a small hole first and then a wider one about 26 to 28 inches (65-70 centimeters) in diameter. Golborne said the second pass would progress more slowly than the first pass.  Plan A involved using a drill placed directly above the shelter where the miners were holed up. Under Plan B, a hole was drilled at a roughly 80-degree angle into an area of the mine shaft that was used as a mechanical workshop. That distance, engineers estimated, was around 2,034 feet (620 meters). The drill used in Plan C needed to cut through some 1,969 feet (600 meters) of rock and earth.  Plan A drill was a Raise Borer Strata 950, usually used for drilling ventilation shafts in mines.  Plan B drill was a Schramm T-130, usually used for boring water holes.  Plan C drill was a Rig 421 drill, usually used for drilling for oil. "], "Language": false}
