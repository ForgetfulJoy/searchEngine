Along with his brother Robert, the former Barcelona forward was arrested by Paraguay's national police on March 4.  The prosecutor's office said that officials found various documents, including ID cards and Paraguayan passports in the men's names. Both men, who were being held in a prison in Asunci\u00f3n, appeared in court via a video conference on Tuesday.  READ: Radomir Antic, the only man to coach Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, has died aged 71 Judge Gustavo Amarilla announced the ruling, explaining that each man had paid a bond of $800,000.  Both men will remain in a hotel in the Paraguayan capital while they continue to be investigated.  The sentencing was broadcast live by Paraguayan news outlets.  Authorities claimed that Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, also known as \"Ronaldinho,\" was using authentic passports containing false content.  Documents were found during a search of the sports star's suite at the Yacht Resort Hotel and Golf Club in Lambar\u00e9, near the Paraguayan capital city of Asunci\u00f3n, prosecutors said in a statement published on Facebook. Authorities said that in order to have a Paraguayan passport, a person must live for a certain amount of time in the country. \"Ronaldinho and his brother entered the country at 9.05 a.m. on a commercial flight which landed at Silvio Petirossi International Airport. They entered using a Paraguayan passport which was authentic but contained false information,\" public prosecutor Federico Delfino said in a Facebook post at the time. \"We now know that the numbers of these passports belong to other people. They are real passports but with fake details. They were issued in January 2020, and the ID cards, which were given to them when they arrived, in December.\" Paraguayan authorities believed that their Brazilian counterparts had previously taken away the brother's Brazilian passports due to financial issues -- however, they were told that in fact the documents were returned to them in October 2019. Paraguayan Attorney General's Office told CNNE that Brazilian counterparts said both men departed their country with real Brazilian passports.
