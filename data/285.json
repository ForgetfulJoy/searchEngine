Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has extended the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown in three major states\u00a0\u2014Abuja, Lagos and Ogun \u2014 for another week until May 4. In a national address Monday evening, Buhari said the country will phase into an eased lockdown period, with some businesses and sectors being allowed to open after the total lockdown period ends on May 4. After this date, there will also be overnight curfews from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time in the three states.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the northern state of Kano will be place under total lockdown for two weeks because of a spike in the number of deaths in the region. These deaths have not been officially linked to coronavirus. However, autopsies have not been carried out because they are not in line with Islamic burial practices in the state, officials said. Nigeria first introduced lockdowns for the three worst affected states on March 30. This was then extended for a further two weeks by the President. Buhari added that Nigeria's Center for Disease Control on Monday accredited 15 laboratories nationwide with an aggregate capacity to undertake 2,500 tests per day across the country. Nigeria has only tested around 10,000 people so far, out of a population of 200 million. As of Monday, the country has recorded 1,273 positive Covid-19 cases and 40 deaths, according to the NCDC. ##Health## ##Daily Life##\u00a0 \u00a0 Global coronavirus cases have now topped 3,000,000, according to a running tally done by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly a third of all cases in the United States, the university reported. The United States has a count of at least 972,969 confirmed cases as of 2 p.m. ET, according to the JHU Coronavirus Resource Center website.\u00a0\u00a0 Spain follows the US as the nation with the second highest count of Covid-19 cases worldwide, with a total of 229,422 cases, according to Johns Hopkins.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Health## \u00a0 Paraguay President Mario Abdo Benitez announced Monday that in-person classes will remain closed through December.\u00a0 Benitez said that although there is \u201cscientific evidence suggesting children are less vulnerable to the virus,\u201d the government has a \u201cconstitutional obligation\u201d to care for the health of its citizens. \u201cWe know this decision is unprecedented,\u201d Benitez said. \u201cI would like to ask for cooperation, mainly from parents and from the education sector.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI know that it will be a difficult year, but we are confident that we will be able to develop and deepen our capacity in the use of technology within the education system,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The National Educators Union released a statement earlier this month, highlighting the difficulty teachers were experiencing to meet deadlines due to the \u201cdeficient coverage\u201d provided in order to reach students without access to internet or other technology.\u00a0 The Paraguayan Health Ministry launched virtual training courses for teachers last week to help develop curriculums for online classes, according to the Education Ministry\u2019s website.\u00a0The ministry said \u201cphysical materials\u201d would be distributed to students in areas with limited access to internet.\u00a0 Paraguay has confirmed at least 228 cases of coronavirus and nine deaths. \u00a0##Daily Life## Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organization Director-General said, the coronavirus pandemic isn't over. \u201cThe pandemic is far from over,\u201d he said at a news conference. He said the World Health Organization \"continues to be concerned about the increasing trends in Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and some Asian countries.\" \u201cAs in all regions, cases and deaths are underreported in many countries in these regions, because of low testing capacity,\u201d Tedros said.\u00a0 \u201cThis virus will not be defeated if we are not united, if we are not united, the virus will exploit the cracks between us and continue to create havoc. Lives will be lost,\u201d Tedros added.\u00a0 ##Health## Four million jobs have been furloughed in the UK and a quarter of businesses have stopped trading, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the UK Parliament today. He said that \"we should be in no doubt\" about the seriousness of the economic situation. \"We can't save every job and every business\" Sunak said,\u00a0adding that \"these are already tough times, and there will be more to come.\" Sunak told members of Parliament he understood and shared people's anxiety, but that the most important thing the government can do to protect the economy is to \"protect the health of our people.\" He said that the government's financial assistance package should act as a bridge, supporting viable businesses to stay afloat and protecting the jobs of people who would have otherwise been laid off during what he called a \"sharp and significant\" crisis.\u00a0 Sunak said 16 billion GBP \u2014 about $19.8 billion USD \u2014 has been paid out so far to the National Health Service and other public services, and around half a million employers applied for the job retention scheme, which guarantees to pay 80% of workers' wages up to the\u00a02,500 GBP (about 3,100 USD) if they are put on leave. ##Business## Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet tomorrow with regional governors to discuss the spread of coronavirus around the country. Asked in a conference call when Russians might expect an exit from self-isolation orders, Peskov said it was too early for predictions.\u00a0 \u201cIt is obvious that a decision remains to be made based on current dynamics and short-term forecasts,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cForecasts for the medium- and long term are hardly possible.

From March through April 26,\u00a0874 servicemen have tested positive,\u00a0the Defense Ministry said Sunday, adding that most of them were either\u00a0isolated at\u00a0home or in military hospitals.\u00a0 Another 971\u00a0cases\u00a0were found among cadets in military academies and schools across the country, and\u00a0245\u00a0civilians employed\u00a0by the defense ministry have tested positive. The majority of patients showed no\u00a0symptoms, the statement added. Over the past weeks,\u00a0reports had emerged in Russia\u2019s independent media outlets about coronavirus outbreaks in military academies,\u00a0including troops who took part in the Moscow rehearsals for the\u00a0May 9\u00a0Victory Day\u00a0parade.\u00a0 Last week, the head of the prestigious Kirov Military Medical Academy in Moscow was\u00a0fired for\u00a0failing to implement adequate coronavirus measures.\u00a0 \u201cThe academy made errors in implementing preventive\u00a0measures\u00a0at the faculty for the training of medics for foreign armies, which led\u00a0to infection\u00a0among some cadets,\u201d the defense ministry said, according to state-run agency TASS.\u00a0\"Given that \u2026 the head of the academy, Alexander Fisun, was\u00a0removed from his\u00a0position.\" The defense ministry did not disclose the exact number of cases at the\u00a0academy,\u00a0saying that cases were found in foreign students as well\u00a0as 55 cases in\u00a0students of other faculties.\u00a0 Several thousand servicemen have\u00a0also\u00a0been quarantined after they took\u00a0part in\u00a0dress rehearsals for the\u00a0Victory Day\u00a0parade in the Moscow region as late as April 6. At\u00a0the time,\u00a0Russia\u00a0had officially reported over 6,000 coronavirus cases and\u00a0Moscow officials\u00a0had already banned gatherings of more than 50 people.\u00a0 The massive parade marking the end of World War II in Europe, which\u00a0usually has around 13,000 troops marching on the Red Square, has since been\u00a0postponed\u00a0by President Vladimir Putin. The defense ministry is still moving ahead with\u00a0its annual\u00a0spring draft, with 135,000 army conscripts expected to be\u00a0called up\u00a0in May.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## In a small town, everyone pitches in, says Tim Putnam, the CEO at a rural hospital in Batesville, Indiana. So even as the coronavirus pandemic puts added strain on many rural hospitals' finances and resources, they are buoyed by the support and sacrifice of their communities and individuals. Neighbors leave encouraging messages, businesses make donations and medical professionals work around the clock in compromising environments. Even those at the top of rural hospital administration are getting into the thick of the coronavirus fight. For some CEOs, that means hitting the road to ensure their staff had the supplies they need to continue serving the communities that need them. John Henderson, CEO of Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals, formed part of a \"daisy chain\" transporting a supply of 70,000 surgical masks to 40 or 50 rural Texas hospital sites, he said. Adam Willmann, President and CEO of Goodall-Witcher Healthcare in Clifton, Texas, began frequenting local hardware stores, lumber yards and feed stores to stock up on N95 masks. \"I take this a lot more personally than maybe others do at a normal job because it's not a normal job to me,\" he said.

The group met Saturday but did not Sunday -- a rarity since the task force has met almost every day since it was assembled.\u00a0 Task force meetings usually last about 90 minutes at least as aides go over the latest data before the press briefing. But given there was no briefing this weekend, the meeting Saturday moved relatively quickly, a person who attended said. The\u00a0task force may soon begin slowly scaling back its number of meetings altogether, a separate person told CNN,\u00a0as President Trump and Vice President Pence schedule other events.\u00a0 The President spent the weekend venting about the negative coverage he received after he suggested last week there should be studies into whether disinfectants or light could be used to fight the coronavirus inside the human body. An exasperated President lashed out at aides, the media and Democrats in what multiple sources described to CNN as one of the most frustrated moments of his presidency.\u00a0 One of the things weighing heaviest on the president, people close to him say, are his sinking poll numbers. But being stuck inside doesn't help either. People who speak with the President often said he's internalizing negative coverage more than ever because he doesn't have his usual outlets, like golf.\u00a0 Divisions are also emerging among the staff in the West Wing. The new West Wing communications team has decided to retake control of the coronavirus messaging that Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff had been handling since he was tapped to lead the task force in late February.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## A village in the southern state of Kerala is distributing 10,000 umbrellas to residents to help maintain social distancing, according to a senior local council official. \"We hope the clouds of Covid-19 may clear soon but during the summer and upcoming days of rain let us keep social distancing by unfolding an umbrella,\" PS Jyothi, president of the Thannermukkom village council said.\u00a0 The idea is to stand next to one another with open umbrellas to maintain a distance of at least a meter, Jyothi added. Along with umbrellas, two masks each will also be distributed to citizens.\u00a0 Women's neighborhood groups will stitch 100,000 masks under the Kudumbashree initiative in Kerala. The initiative, which mobilizes community groups, was launched under the Kerala state poverty mission to empower women but is being repurposed to fight coronavirus at a local level, according to Jyothi.\u00a0 The state has used several innovative measures to help contain the spread of coronavirus and trace infected patients.\u00a0 Walk-in kiosks\u00a0were installed in a district in Kerala to facilitate sample collection earlier this month, and a\u00a0robot\u00a0is being used in a Kerala hospital to dispense medicines and food to patients in isolation wards to reduce human contact.\u00a0 Kerala was the first state in India to report cases of the coronavirus. The state currently has 458 cases of coronavirus including 4 deaths. India has a total of\u00a027,892 cases of the coronavirus, including 872 deaths,\u00a0according to the Indian Ministry of Health.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## Maatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China.\u00a0 The false claims are spreading across YouTube every day, so far racking up hundreds of thousands of apparent views, and have been embraced by Chinese Communist Party media. Despite never having tested positive for the coronavirus or experienced symptoms, Benassi and her husband are now subjects of discussion on Chinese social media about the outbreak, including among accounts that are known drivers of large-scale coordinated activities by their followers.\u00a0 The claims have turned their lives upside down. The couple say their home address has been posted online and that, before they shut down their accounts, their social media inboxes were overrun with messages from believers of the conspiracy.\u00a0 It's like waking up from a bad dream going into a nightmare day after day,\" Maatje Benassi told CNN in her first interview since being smeared online. The family's suffering highlights the potential for blatant falsehoods to be rewarded and amplified by social media platforms. It also serves as a powerful reminder that misinformation online, however wild or obviously untrue it may seem, can have real and lasting consequences offline.

So during the present pandemic, keeping your toilets, sinks, counters and showers as germ-free as possible is key to keeping you and your family healthy. The novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, is known to live on hard surfaces for up to three days,\u00a0according to data\u00a0published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Your bathroom has plenty of those. Start by washing your hands.\u00a0For your surfaces, you can use any household disinfectant, but the US Environmental Protection Agency released a\u00a0five-page list\u00a0of high-quality options -- including Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and certain Lysol sprays -- which can defeat \"harder to kill\" viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Focus on cleaning \"high-touch\" areas of your bathroom including light switches, door knobs and the sink areas in particular. Don't forget less obvious areas such as shower heads, shower curtains, the toilet seat, hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, shavers and other appliances. After you wipe down hard surfaces like sinks and counter tops, make sure to leave them wet for 3 to 5 minutes. The American Cleaning Institute recommends letting the surfaces air-dry before rinsing them with water.\u00a0 Read the full article here. ##Daily Life## The court hearing on whether Julian Assange will be extradited from the UK to the United States is set to be adjourned until September because of the coronavirus.  Citing fears around the virus, Edward Fitzgerald, QC, Assange\u2019s lawyer, said\u00a0the \u201cevidence is it would not be medically safe for Assange to attend a video conference,\" according to News Central UK, a British court reporting service. Fitzgerald said that for \u201cover a month\u201d his team have had no direct access to the WikiLeaks founder, who is being held at Belmarsh prison in south-east London, where visits have not been possible. He said \u201cthere have always been great difficulties in seeking access to Mr. Assange but with the coronavirus outbreak the preparation of this case goes from difficult to impossible,\u201d the court reporting service said. He said that should the hearing go ahead on May 18, Assange \u201cwould be fighting a David and Goliath battle with his hands behind his back.\u201d Assange\u2019s lawyer concluded that \u201cfor all these reasons we submit it is the fairest course to adjourn the matter from May to fix it for September when a realistic date can be settled on.\u201d The judge presiding over proceedings, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser agreed that the extradition hearing should be adjourned. An administrative hearing will be heard on May 4. Assange is wanted in America for allegedly conspiring with US military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to expose classified US intelligence back in 2010. He was granted political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 and was arrested in April 2019 in London. ##Daily Life## Prosecutors in the northern Italian city of Bergamo have opened an investigation into the handling of the coronavirus outbreak there, Prosecutor Maria Cristina Rotta\u2018s office\u00a0told CNN on Monday.\u00a0 Bergamo is in Lombardy, the Italian province worst-hit by the coronavirus, and was among the first areas to be put under restrictions to try to curb the spread of Covid-19. Bergamo citizen Luca Fusco, whose father died of coronavirus in March, started a Facebook group called\u00a0\"Noi Denunceremo\"\u00a0-- meaning \"we will denounce you\" -- to hold the authorities to account. The group, which has 48,000 members, wants to ''ensure that\u00a0the truth of what really happened gets out,\" Fusco said. We knew there was a problem, we saw the underestimation of the problem. We saw the cases in Codogno, we saw the cases in northern Italy, and no one was doing anything in the beginning,\" Fusco told CNN. Separately,\u00a0ANAAO, a doctors' union, has lodged formal complaints to prosecutors in 10 regions over what it described as a shortage of personal protective equipment for healthcare staff. \u201cThere's a lack of adequate personal protective equipment for doctors exposed to Covid-19. The high number of infections is linked to the failure to supply FFP2 and FFP3 filter masks,\u201d Carlo Palermo, national secretary of the ANAAO, told CNN on Monday. So far, 150 doctors\u00a0in Italy have died after contracting coronavirus, the Italian Association of\u00a0Doctors\u00a0said on Friday, adding that healthcare professionals constitute 10% of all infections.\u00a0 ##Health## Meryl Streep, Audra McDonald and\u00a0Christine Baranski, boozing in their bathrobes while singing \"The Ladies Who Lunch\": This was the\u00a0quarantine\u00a0moment the world didn't know it needed -- until now. The dressing gown-clad trio delivered internet gold when they joined a host of A-listers Sunday night to celebrate legendary composer Stephen Sondheim's 90th birthday and his vast contribution to musical theater. While Streep poured herself what looked like a martini (vigorously shaken, not stirred), her \"Mamma Mia\" co-star Baranski, 67, opted for a large glass of red, and Broadway diva McDonald, 49, went straight for the bottle. For many viewers, the boozy performance and disheveled vibe captured lockdown life perfectly.\u00a0 Read the full story here. ##Daily Life## The UK government\u2019s coronavirus restrictions are confusing and are making the job of police even harder than it already is, according to London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Federation chief Ken Marsh. \u201cMy colleagues are the ones being asked -- on an hourly, daily basis\u00a0-- to put this into practice,\u201d Marsh told BBC Radio 5. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re trying to ask two people not to sit on a bench, and my colleague looks over his or her shoulder and sees 300 people queueing to go to a DIY store without a piece of paper between them, then what do we do?\u201d He said there had been \u201cmixed messages\u201d coming from the government about what is allowed and what isn\u2019t. Marsh said that in the past few days, an increasing number of DIY stores had opened up and the volume of traffic on the roads had been increasing \u201cquite heavily.\" Meanwhile, the UK government is inviting members of the public to submit questions to the daily coronavirus press briefings via the website gov.uk/ask.  The government says an independent polling organization will choose one question a day, which will not be seen or heard by the ministers before it is asked live.\u00a0 The briefings have been held by a rotating group of government ministers, with journalists asking questions via video conference.  Members of the public whose submissions are selected can either record a video of themselves asking their question, or have it read out loud during the briefing.

The final test results for the drug, remdesivir, aren\u2019t expected until mid-to-late May, said Dr. Andre Kalil, a principal investigator for the trial.\u00a0But he said the team might \u201cpotentially have some early data in the next one or two weeks.\" Remdesivir was originally tested\u00a0by Gilead Sciences as a potential treatment for Ebola, and it showed activity against the novel coronavirus in test tubes. But whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19 remains unclear. The new study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial -- meaning neither the patients nor their doctors know who is receiving the real drug and who is receiving a placebo. Patients finished enrolling for the study last Sunday,\u00a0Kalil said, adding that their number had exceeded the\u00a0target of 572. The trial began at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where Kalil is a professor of medicine, but it has expanded to nearly 70 sites around the world, from South Korea to Germany.\u00a0 Data on remdesivir is confusing at best. Earlier this month, the maker of the drug, Gilead\u00a0released information\u00a0on 53 patients, most of whom showed improvement after receiving infusions of remdesivir. Information\u00a0leaked\u00a0to STAT News suggested that patients receiving remdesivir were recovering quickly, but the report\u00a0was based on a recorded discussion of a clinical trial, and\u00a0offered few details. Last week, the World Health Organization\u00a0accidentally published a summary of results\u00a0from a trial of the drug in coronavirus patients. A screenshot published by\u00a0STAT showed\u00a0 \"remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement.\" But that trial was terminated early due to low enrolment, and Gilead said it was inconclusive. ##Health## Volkswagen -- the world's largest carmaker by sales -- restarted\u00a0work at its biggest factory,\u00a0in northern Germany, on Monday.\u00a0 In a statement,\u00a0VW said 8,000\u00a0employees in the city of Wolfsburg began\u00a0building cars again on Monday, under tight\u00a0hygiene restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus.  The company says it expects 1,400 cars to be built this week.\u00a0Next week, production will be ramped up to more than 6,000 cars -- around\u00a040% of pre-crisis levels. \"Step-by-step resumption of production is an important signal for the workforce, dealerships, suppliers and the wider economy,\" said Ralf Brandstaetter, Chief Operating Officer of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand. \n\"In terms of managing the crisis, though, this is just the first step. Additional momentum is needed to stimulate demand in Germany and throughout Europe so that production volumes can be successively increased.\" The company says it has implemented extra hygiene measures at the factory. Employees are expected to check their temperature at home every morning, and to change into their overalls at home, to prevent crowding in factory changing rooms.  Markings on the factory floor will help workers maintain a 1.5-meter distance from each other. Where this is not possible, mouth and nose protection must be worn. VW says extra time is being provided to allow employees to disinfect tools and surfaces.  Volkswagen began producing components in several German cities in early April and resumed manufacturing in Germany and Slovakia on April 20. This week the company plans to restart production in Portugal, Spain, Russia, South Africa and South America and from May 3 onwards in Tennessee in the United States. ##Business## Carlos Davis used to have about 200 clients drop by his CUT-ology barbershop in Albany, Georgia, every day.\u00a0On Friday, the first day he was allowed to reopen since the coronavirus pandemic began, around 30 clients came in.\u00a0 Wearing gloves, a construction face mask and a face shield, Davis said he was taking precautions to protect staff and clients. A piece of paper on the door outlined the mandatory guidelines, saying clients must wear a mask and gloves in order to enter.\u00a0 Davis is afraid of the virus, but he also fears losing his business. \"If I don't cut, I don't eat,\" he said. Davis's decision to reopen comes as\u00a0a number of states have begun to loosen stay-at-home restrictions\u00a0-- even as the novel coronavirus continues to infect and kill people.  Across the country, more than 950,000 people have tested positive for the virus and more than 54,000 have died. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy allowed salons and restaurants to reopen in most parts of the state Friday. Oklahoma allowed some personal-care businesses to reopen for appointments Friday as well. Even in California,\u00a0some beaches that had been closed reopened\u00a0for public use, though with limitations. Georgia's\u00a0reopening has been the most aggressive so far. Gov. Brian Kemp ordered the reopening of hair and nail salons, gyms, bowling alleys, tattoo studios and massage therapists on Friday, with theaters and restaurants to follow on Monday.  The reopenings come despite warnings from health experts, local mayors and even\u00a0President Donald Trump.  The\u00a0influential Covid-19 model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, for example, says social distancing should not be relaxed in Georgia until June 22.

Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand's Director General of Health, said the low number \"does give us confidence that we've achieved our goal of elimination, which -- that never meant zero but it does mean we know where our cases are coming from.\" He added: \"Our goal is elimination. And again, that doesn't mean eradication but it means we get down to a small number of cases so that we are able to stamp out any cases and any outbreak that might come out.\"\u00a0 New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the coronavirus was \"currently\" eliminated but that the country needed to remain alert and could still expect to continue to see new cases.

French Grand Prix organisers announced on Monday that it was impossible for the race to go ahead as planned on June 28. French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this month expanded the country's ban on major events until at least the middle of July and imposed travel restrictions. The 2020 season has yet to begin -- the French Grand Prix is the 10th race to have been canceled or postponed in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Carey said in a statement that he was \"increasingly confident with the progress of our plans to begin our season this summer\" with a view to kicking off in Austria in July -- albeit in all likelihood behind closed doors. He added: \"We\u2019re targeting a start to racing in Europe through July, August and beginning of September,\u00a0with the first race taking place in Austria on 3-5 July weekend.\" \"September, October and November, would see us race in Eurasia, Asia and the Americas, finishing the season in the Gulf in December with Bahrain before the traditional finale in Abu Dhabi, having completed between 15-18 races.\" He said he hoped fans would be part of the events further into the schedule, adding that there were many issues to work out regarding travel to each country. British Grand Prix organisers announced on Monday that their event remains on course to take place on July 19 -- but that it will be held without spectators. ##Business## The UK could experience more than 100,000 coronavirus deaths later this year if the government eases restrictions to focus on just protecting those most at risk, according to one of the country\u2019s leading epidemiologists. Neil Ferguson is one of the scientists who has been advising the government in its response to the pandemic. \"The people most at risk of death are in care homes or have other health conditions,\" Ferguson said in an interview with the 'Unherd' website. \"I am very sceptical we can get to the level of shielding which would make that a viable strategy,\u201d he said, referring to the idea of easing restrictions for most people and focusing government efforts on those most at risk.\n\"If you just achieve 80 percent shielding -- 80 percent reduction in infection risk in those groups \u2013 we still project you\u2019d get well over 100,000 deaths later this year.\" The government is coming under pressure to ease some coronavirus restrictions. Positive signs: Ferguson, a\u00a0professor\u00a0of mathematical biology at Imperial College London whose modelling has influenced UK government policy, says the restrictions have been working. He said there has been an 80 to 90 percent drop in contact between people from different households, and this is believed to have brought transmission rates down.   \"We\u2019ve brought the reproduction number down somewhere in the region of 0.6 to 0.7, which (means) the epidemic is in decline now,\u201d he said. No time to relax: Ferguson said the challenge is that there isn't a lot of \"leeway to relax without other interventions.\" \"So, if we want to move away from lockdown -- reopen schools, reopen workplaces, let people go shopping again -- we have to substitute other measures.\" ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Travel UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned against relaxing the United Kingdom's coronavirus restrictions too soon in his first remarks since returning to work after contracting the disease, imploring the nation to \"contain your impatience.\"  Speaking outside Downing Street in London, Johnson said that the UK was making progress in tackling the outbreak, with fewer ICU hospital admissions for Covid-19 patients, and \"real signs now that we are passing through the peak.\"  The virus has killed more than 20,000 people in the UK. \"If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is, then this is the moment when we are beginning to wrestle it to the floor,\" Johnson said. But he warned that the UK was at a moment of \"maximum risk\" as people's patience might be fraying with the restrictive measures imposed to stop the spread of the virus.\u00a0 Johnson said he understood the worries of shopkeepers and entrepreneurs, and that without a functioning economy there was no way of funding the NHS.

It calls on communities to come together during hardship, adapt to challenging circumstances and provide a fair go for all. Anzac Day: For 15-year-old Australian Patrick Stibbard, mateship means looking out for one another. On Saturday, like millions of other Australians and New Zealanders, he stood on his driveway to commemorate Anzac Day and to\u00a0the lives lost during war. Traditional dawn services were canceled this year due to the coronavirus lockdown, but the 60 seconds of silence felt all the more poignant this year. It was a tribute not only to those who served and sacrificed on battlefields abroad, but also the frontline heroes fighting Covid-19 right now at home. Passing the baton: For 240 days over the summer, wildfires blazed across Australia, killing 33 people, over a billion animals, and destroying thousands of houses. Before flowers had time to sprout through the ashes, the nation was already grappling with a new crisis, the global coronavirus pandemic. Firefighters passed the baton to health care workers, in what will be remembered as the year of the frontline worker. From those in uniform to ordinary Aussies, mateship is \"understanding that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a huge difference,\" according to Erin Boutros, the co-founder of volunteer group Empty Esky.

The US\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0task force official has been caught in an unenviable spot, juggling her public health mission and reputation with the need to stay in the good graces of Trump, who has shown both a penchant for\u00a0touting unproven therapies\u00a0and a willingness to show his critics the exit. Birx, a physician and diplomat, came under scrutiny Thursday when she failed, in real time, to correct Trump's assertion at the White House briefing that injecting disinfectant into the body might combat the virus. She further compromised her science focus Sunday by\u00a0defending the President's remark\u00a0as an example of the way he processes information aloud. But Birx is facing what may become an even more difficult challenge to her credibility in the weeks ahead: the gap between the insufficient level of coronavirus testing -- a lynchpin to opening the economy -- and the federal government's failure to put a viable testing infrastructure and guidelines in place.

This comes after a photo surfaced on social media last week showing Ames in a nail salon soaking her hands in a bowl. At the time of the visit, there were executive orders in place requiring salons to remain closed because of the Covid-19 crisis. Ames told CNN affiliate KFDM that she was not having her nails done, but had gone to the salon to pick up solution needed to remove her\u00a0artificial nails because \"they hurt.\" Once at the salon, the mayor said\u00a0the owner\u00a0had her come in for a few minutes to show her how to perform the process.  Ames said she and the owner of the salon were alone in the closed salon, both wearing masks, at least six feet apart, before she left within minutes, according to KFDM.

The economy \u201cis likely to remain in a severe situation for the time being due to the impact of the spread of the novel coronavirus at home and abroad,\u201d the central bank wrote in a statement released Monday as it concluded a shortened policy meeting.  While it said Japan\u2019s economy is likely to improve as the outbreak wanes, the central bank added that \u201cfuture developments are extremely unclear.\u201d Officials had earlier predicted growth between 0.8% and 1.1% for 2020. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady Monday at its policy meeting, which usually lasts two days but was shortened to just half a day this month. But it did announce more easing measures as it tries to offset economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and address corporate funding strains.  The central bank said it would now buy an unlimited amount of government bonds, scrapping an annual cap of 80 trillion yen ($745 billion). The move was largely symbolic, since the central bank has in recent years been buying about a quarter of that amount annually, so it had a lot of room to increase its purchases even without removing the cap.  However, Monday\u2019s announcement sends the message that Japan will do whatever it takes to shore up its economy. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already committed roughly $1.1 trillion to protecting the country from virus-related fallout. Japan\u2019s economy had been flirting with recession even before the outbreak. The world\u2019s third-largest economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2019 as it absorbed a sales tax hike and grappled with the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, a powerful storm that hit the country last fall.  Japan will report first quarter GDP next month.\u00a0 ##Business## All hospitalized coronavirus patients in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, have been discharged from hospitals, Mi Feng, a spokesperson for China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Sunday. \u201cWith joint effort of medical professionals from Wuhan and from around the country, by April 26, all hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Wuhan have been cleared,\u201d Mi said. Wuhan was the first city in the world to go into lockdown due to the virus. It has been slowly returning to something that might be described as normal, after months of fear and anxiety. But the scars of the viral outbreak,\u00a0which for 76 days\u00a0shut down\u00a0the Chinese city\u00a0and much of the surrounding Hubei province, lie just beneath the surface. Many citizens are worried about a second outbreak and businesses are struggling to get back on their feet. The first known cases of the virus were detected in Wuhan in mid-December. In the weeks that followed, case numbers spiked and from January 23 until April 8, residents were unable to leave the city as the Chinese government attempted to contain the outbreak. But despite the attempts to halt the spread of the virus, it has now infected nearly 3 million people worldwide.

What it means: Under level 3, New Zealand will still essentially be under lockdown, but there will be an easing of restrictions. Schools can open. People will be able to buy takeaway food, and take part in more recreational activities, such as swimming at the beach. Up to 10 people will be allowed to gather for weddings and funerals.\u00a0 Alert level 3 does not permit more social activity, but would allow more economic activity like construction, manufacturing and forestry. Dwindling cases: The move comes as New Zealand has seen a dwindling number of coronavirus cases over the past few weeks.

Here's what he said: Warning: Just because some areas looking to reopen have experienced relatively small outbreaks doesn't mean they're not at risk, Gates said. Many are concerned that reopening too soon could prompt a\u00a0second wave of infections In stages: It will require thinking critically about which elements of society are most essential to get back to work, implementing safety measures as they are reopened and ensuring diagnostic testing and\u00a0contact tracing\u00a0are in place. Finding the cause of a rebound: \"What we don't know is, (if) we go slightly back to normal, which activities create the risk of a rebound?\" Gates said.\u00a0 Ramp up testing: \"We need to put in place a very dense testing regime so you would detect that rebound going back into exponential growth very quickly and not wait for the ICUs to fill up and there to be a lot of deaths. If you see the hot spot, you kind of understand the activities causing that,\" he said.  Planning for reopening: States should focus on \"high value\" segments of the economy such as schools, manufacturing and construction, and should figure out how to operate those things with masks and social distancing, Gates said.  Continue tracking: Once some schools and businesses get back to work, communities should continue to track the effects on infection rates, he said. But it will take time. \"The inequality has gotten greater in education, so if we can figure out how to do K through 12 in the fall, that would be good,\" Gates said.

Each individual claim represents a life on edge.  People who never had their hands out before are going to food banks, and the unemployment rate is suddenly approaching Great Depression territory. It's the same story around the world. President Donald Trump thinks pent-up demand will ensure that the US economy takes off when normal life creaks open and once customers are free to shop and spend again. But even if the virus were waning across the US -- which it isn't -- shops, restaurants, bars and movie theaters would likely reopen at reduced capacity.  And there's no guarantee those other jobs will ever come back. Fewer workers will mean fewer people with money to buy cars and go on vacation -- which will mean that industries like tourism, entertainment and hospitality have a long haul.

Contact with bat droppings or urine could expose them to some of the world's deadliest unknown viruses. Equipped with headlights, they set their nets up at the entrance of the dark opening overhung with bamboo trees, which is part of a vast system of limestone caves in China's south-western Yunnan province. Then they patiently wait for dusk. When the sun sets, thousands of bats fly out of the caves, looking for food -- and straight into their nets. Peter Daszak is a virus hunter. He presides over EcoHealth Alliance, an American NGO which specializes in detecting new viruses and pandemic prevention.
