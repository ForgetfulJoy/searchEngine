So when a bookstore with a cheeky name\u2014The Last Bookstore\u2014opened in Los Angeles, Chad Howitt was curious. He stopped by and did some research, and what he learned about the store and its owner compelled Howitt to make the documentary \u201cWelcome to the Last Bookstore.\u201d\n\nThe film depicts a small business success story. But it goes deeper than that, painting an inspiring portrait of Josh Spencer, The Last Bookstore\u2019s owner. Spencer has been paraplegic since he was hit by a car while riding a moped in the mid-\u201990s. As we learn in Howitt\u2019s film, it took him about 10 years to adjust to his reality.\n\nHowitt, a first-time documentary filmmaker with a background in visual effects and advertising, was eager to share Spencer\u2019s personal story. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in commercial production, TV commercials, visual effects, a lot of computer-based imagery. So I wanted to test myself and see if there was a way I could tell a human story and something without all the polish and gloss, or Michael Bay effects,\u201d says Howitt, who is currently creative director of the digital agency We Are Royale.\n\nPart of being a filmmaker is connecting with one\u2019s subjects and building trust, and Howitt and producer Matt Olson met with Spencer to talk before the bookstore owner agreed to take part in the film. \u201cHe wanted to meet first, which is completely understandable,\u201d Howitt says. \u201cYou never know anyone\u2019s motives, and you need to know who they are, what they\u2019re up to, what they\u2019re asking for. Especially when we were wanting to talk about him and his life as well.\u201d\n\nTo make the film, Howitt assembled a small crew of friends and colleagues, including James Laxton. Howitt had shot a few commercials with Laxton, who served as DP on \u201cWelcome to the Last Bookstore.\u201d (The cinematographer went on to shoot two of director Barry Jenkins\u2019s feature films\u20142017\u2019s \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which won the Oscar for best picture in 2017 and earned Laxton a nomination for best cinematographer, and \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d)\n\nVisually, Howitt and Laxton aspired to make \u201cWelcome to The Last Bookstore\u201d feel as raw and as real as possible. \u201cWe just wanted to prioritize the idea of observation over presentation. We wanted to make sure that we felt like we were a fly on the wall,\u201d Howitt says. \u201cAnytime there was a discussion, I tried to keep Josh right in front of the camera, having him tell the story facing towards the lens and making it as intimate as possible.\u201d\n\nWhen we\u2019re not making films, we\u2019re watching them.
