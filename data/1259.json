The findings, published in the medical journal The Lancet, detail the first known transmission of novel coronavirus in the United States, and suggest that the virus may transmit most easily through extended contact with infected people, not brief or casual exposures. Dr. Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer of the Chicago Department of Public Health, who co-led the research, stressed that health care providers should still \"rapidly triage and isolate individuals suspected of having [the virus]\" and notify local health departments. That's because, according to the study, \"infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response\" to these first cases might have prevented widespread coronavirus exposure. And it's possible that other patients \u2014 those with more severe illness, for example \u2014 may transmit the virus more easily. The researchers cautioned that their findings are preliminary and based on a single transmission event, which might not represent the population at large. The study had other limitations, too. Because they relied on memories to reconstruct people's movements, investigators might not have identified everybody who came into contact with the coronavirus patients. ##Health## Madison Square Garden and the Barclays Center could be closed for months, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference today.

But there is one big concern involving blood donations and coronavirus: the possibility that fewer people will come out to donate. \"If the outbreak of coronavirus continues to spread, additional challenges may arise, which could potentially reduce the number of eligible donors,\" the AABB said. ##Your Questions## The US Senate will be in session next week and will not go on a previously scheduled recess, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The Senate will be in session next week,\" McConnell wrote on Twitter. \"I am glad talks are ongoing between the Administration and Speaker Pelosi. I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong.\" This comes as Republican senators up for reelection did not want to go home without passing an economic relief bill.

The Trump administration did not have those concerns about the United Kingdom, the spokesperson told CNN, and\u00a0President Trump, during a press gathering Thursday afternoon, said he did not have concerns about the United Kingdom, which has \"very strong borders.\"\u00a0 The DHS told CNN they\u00a0have seen a lot of broken travel histories from individuals from some of those European countries, which makes it harder to track their movements.

During a House Oversight Committee hearing Thursday discussing the coronavirus response, Redfield said the \"real risk in general right now, and this is why the President took the action he did last night, within the world now, over 70% of the new cases are linked to Europe.

The US Department of Health and Human Services, the US Food and Drug Administration and US blood banks are urging blood donations and\u00a0trying to\u00a0calm fears. They said in a statement that coronavirus does not pose any known risks to blood donors during the donation process. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said\u00a0Americans need to \u201cstart turning out in force to give blood.\u201d The push comes as blood centers are seeing cancellation of drives and significant drops in donations. The American Red Cross said\u00a0300 Red Cross blood drives in the United States have been canceled because of coronavirus concerns. That translates to about 8,000 uncollected blood donations, the group said.\u00a0\u00a0 The FDA and HHS said the cancellation of blood drives means they are unable to keep the blood supply adequately replenished. \u201cWe need people to prevent the blood supply from getting depleted. We need it not to get to the point that surgeries are having to get canceled,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we absolutely do not want to have happen. To ensure an adequate blood supply we need people to come out and donate blood.\u201d The FDA said there \u201chave been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus and the virus poses no known risk to patients receiving blood transfusions.\u201d \u201cIt is safe to donate blood,\u201d said Admiral Dr. Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary for HHS.\u00a0\u201cPart of preparedness includes a robust blood supply. Healthy individuals should schedule an appointment to donate today to ensure that blood is available for those patients who need it.\u201d Kate Fry, chief executive of America\u2019s Blood Centers, which collects close to 60% of the nation\u2019s blood supply, urged people to donate before things get worse. \u201cBlood donors are needed now more than ever.

After Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was asked why people who wanted tests weren\u2019t getting them, Fauci spoke up and said this: \u201cIt is a failing.

But there have been problems with coronavirus testing \u2014 from\u00a0faulty test kits to major shortages and delays in getting tested. The flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms, such as fever and cough, but shortness of breath is a common hallmark of coronavirus. Of course, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms at all. And\u00a0asymptomatic people can still spread coronavirus\u00a0to others. So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said. Anyone who recently traveled to\u00a0a part of the world where coronavirus is widespread\u00a0should do the same. ##Your Questions## The ATP has initiated a six-week suspension of the men\u2019s professional tennis tour due to \u201cescalating health and safety issues\u201d surrounding the global coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 \u201cThe worldwide nature of our sport and the international travel required presents significant risks and challenges in today\u2019s circumstances, as do the increasingly restrictive directives issued by local authorities,\u201d said ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi in a statement. Effective immediately, Jersey City, New Jersey, is rolling out a curfew on large nightclubs in response to coronavirus concerns, the city's Mayor said. Mayor Steve Fulop said the fact that these clubs can welcome as many as 1,000 people each night is the cause for concern, but he did not elaborate on what capacity would fall under a curfew, nor what that curfew would be.

While Italy imposes a nationwide lockdown, and Ireland announces school suspensions, blanket bans aren't quite so simple in fellow European country Germany.  Essentially, German chancellor Angela Merkel does not have the sweeping power to close down large parts of public life across the entire country. Germany is a federal state. So when it comes to political decisions like canceling public events, closing down schools or implement new health regulations, those are taken at state level. Merkel and her national ministers can only make recommendations. Over the last few days, Germany\u2019s Health Minister, Jens Spahn, has repeatedly recommended canceling mass public gatherings with over 1,000 people.  Some of Germany\u2019s hardest-hit regions have implemented this ban already \u2014 but not all of them have. The same goes for the closure of schools and universities. Some have been shut, while others continue to operate.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## The US has canceled travel from 26 European countries to the US for the next 30 days, beginning Friday, as the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide.

Iran\u2019s estimates for the number of coronavirus infections early on in the epidemic are likely to be wildly inaccurate, according to research by a team from Toronto University.  The team estimated that Iran's official figures could be off by nearly 400 times.  The number of infected people in Iran could have been \u201caround 18,000\u201d \u2014 not the 50 that were officially acknowledged, according to assistant professor Ashleigh Tuite, one of the team members who modeled data from infections among people who had left Iran and been diagnosed elsewhere. She said that the estimates today, based on the work they published in February, would be up in the \"hundreds of thousands.\" \u201cBasically by looking at the number of infections that we were seeing in returning travelers, people who had been in Iran and then were diagnosed with COVID-19 in other countries, we were able to use that information, along with information that we have on the number of people who travel every month between Iran and different countries to estimate the number of expected cases that would have to be circulating within Iran,\" she said. ##Health## House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that House Democrats still plan to bring their legislative coronavirus response package to the floor for a vote today, even as she noted that talks are ongoing with the White House in an effort to reach a consensus deal.  \u201cToday we\u2019ll bring to the floor our Families First legislation,\u201d she said at her weekly news conference.

In a statement sent Thursday, the Toronto Raptors said those who traveled to play against the Utah Jazz on Monday have been tested for the virus and have all been asked to go into self-isolation for 14 days. Since returning from Utah on Tuesday morning, team members have made two public appearances. According to Toronto Public Health, being in close contact with someone who does not have COVID-19, but was exposed to someone with COVID-19, does not constitute a risk for getting COVID-19 and does not require public health follow up. People who attended these events should continue to monitor their health, practice social distancing and hand washing, and contact a health professional should they develop symptoms. The Washington Wizards also advised players, coaches and personnel to self-quarantine for the next three to four days. The decision was made with an abundance of caution due to the team\u2019s recent game schedule, which saw them play at Utah on Feb. 29 and against New York (who played Utah on Mar. 4) on Mar. 10.

Growing anecdotal evidence -- if the #emptyplane and #emptyflight hashtags on Twitter and Instagram are a reliable barometer -- indicates there's no shortage of empty airline seats. It's one consequence of anxieties surrounding\u00a0the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Crew and fuel are costly, and the environment plays a price, too. The reason airlines continue to operate these expensive flights, however, is because the industry is engaged in a slots game more high-stakes and lucrative than anything you'll find in Las Vegas. Even when passengers are staying away, airlines still need to protect their slots: their scheduled time on valuable routes.

Australian Treasurer, Josh Frydenburg, told public broadcaster the ABC that the best medical advice to the government has been to keep the current\u00a0travel restrictions in place and not to widen it out to the rest of Europe.\u00a0 He added that the country had already acted quickly to restrict travel from China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. ##Travel## Italian footballer Daniele Rugani, who plays for Juventus, said he was fine today after he tested positive for the coronavirus yesterday. \u201cYou've read the news, so I want to reassure everyone who's worried about me, I'm fine,\u201d Rugani wrote on Twitter.\n\u201cI urge everyone to respect the rules, because this virus makes no distinction! Let's do it for ourselves, for our loved ones and for those around us.\u201d Rugani has made seven appearances this season, including two in February. He was on the bench for last Sunday's win against Inter Milan, which was played behind closed doors at Juventus\u2019 Allianz Stadium. The Italian Football Federation said after a meeting on Tuesday that the Serie A season may not finish because of the outbreak. Alternative options being considered include staging play-offs, not having a champion for 2019-20 or declaring the current standings final. China remains by far the most affected country in terms of coronavirus cases and deaths; it has had 80,793 infections and 3,169 deaths since the pandemic began in December last year. But as the United States and Europe grapple with a growing number of cases, the rate of new infections in China has slowed significantly. China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the pandemic, was reporting thousands of infections per day just weeks ago. Yesterday, there were only eight new infections reported there, the country's National Health Commission said. Xi visits Wuhan: On Tuesday,\u00a0Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first visit to the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan since the outbreak began more than two months ago, an apparent sign of confidence that the country's preventative measures -- including sweeping travel restrictions -- are beginning to work. Hubei authorities\u00a0said in a statement Wednesday\u00a0that the government will gradually allow businesses to reopen and bring public transport back online, key steps in the push to get life back to normal. This will help the battered economy: Beijing's decision to keep factories shut and restrict the movement of tens of millions of people has affected everything from property sales, to local business operations and major supply chains in the world's second-biggest economy. Stock markets worldwide have reacted with wild swings in part due to coronavirus-related fears about the global economy.

So keep your numbers low but your spirits high and let\u2019s take one week at the time.\" The 17-year-old activist asked followers to join \"#DigitalStrike\" on Fridays by posting a photo of striking and using the hashtags #ClimateStrikeOnline #fridaysforfuture #climatestrike #schoolstrike4climate. ##Daily Life## The National Basketball Association was considering several different scenarios to keep players and fans safe as the novel coronavirus outbreak in the United States grew more severe. But when one of its players came down with the virus, North America's most progressive sports league went with the nuclear option: they shut it all down. The NBA chose to indefinitely postpone its regular season, a decision that will almost certainly cost the league millions of dollars in revenue in the short term. The decision was unprecedented. It left league insiders shocked. Players appeared to have no idea it was coming. Outspoken Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's jaw literally dropped when he saw the announcement. Few are faulting league commissioner Adam Silver for taking such extreme measures to keep people safe, but the financial impact will be massive. The NBA and its teams have television contracts worth billions of dollars to air games that may no longer take place. Thousands of fans have purchased tickets to watch those games.  Those revenues don\u2019t just help pay the multimillion dollar salaries for NBA players, coaches and executives \u2013 they help pay for janitors to clean arenas, the staff who sell food and concessions, and the security guards who keep fans and players safe. But perhaps even more importantly is what this decision means for the other big US sports leagues, and sports around the world. The NHL is in the middle of its regular season. Europe's soccer leagues are in full swing (save for Serie A in Italy, which is suspended while the country is on lockdown.) Major League Baseball kicks off later this month. Euro 2020 is this summer. The Tokyo Olympics kick off in July, and then the NFL will start up again in August. The NBA has in recent years enjoyed a reputation as North America's most progressive sports league and has not shied away from sacrificing profits to stand behind its values. Its decision to postpone games means the pressure is now on other sports leagues to follow suit, especially if the outbreak continues to increase unabated. If they do not, they risk appearing as if they value profits over player and fan safety. ##Daily Life## Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country has 140 cases of the coronavirus in a statement earlier today. He didn't provide any breakdown of the numbers and their corresponding states. It's a jump from just a few hours ago, when the country\u2019s Ministry of Health\u00a0released a statement reporting 126 cases nationwide. Morrison also unveiled an $11.4\u00a0billion economic stimulus plan today,  which will include wage subsidies and cash payments for small businesses, to counter the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  Several hours after he spoke, shock waves are still reverberating globally following President Donald Trump's announcement of a travel ban for much of Europe due to the coronavirus pandemic. Here's what has happened since our last catch-up: Global numbers: There are now 124,519 cases and 4,607 deaths globally, according to the\u00a0World Health Organization.\nThe cost of the travel ban: The US Travel Association estimated that Trump's travel ban could cost the US more than $3 billion. Stock markets from Asia to Europe fell sharply following Trump's announcement.\nTom Hanks infected: After the announcement earlier that actor Tom Hanks and his wife actress Rita Wilson tested positive, the Australian TV show \"Today Extra\" -- where Wilson made an appearance -- has put staff under quarantine.\nBeijing imposes quarantine: The Chinese capital will enforce a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all international travelers arriving in the city, after several new cases were imported from overseas this week.\nEuropean crisis: Greece reported its first coronavirus death today, as the virus continues to envelop the continent. Italy remains under lockdown, with Pope Francis urging Italian citizens to \"support\" the authorities. \nSouth Korea cluster: A new cluster was identified earlier this week at a call center in Seoul. Some 80 employees -- all on the same floor -- and others on different floors of the same building tested positive, authorities said today.  Correction: This post was updated to correctly identify actor Tom Hanks as having contracted the novel coronavirus Wyoming has confirmed its first coronavirus case, the state's Department of Health said in a news release. \u201cLab testing at the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory has identified the first known case of a state resident with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19),\" the release said. The patient is a woman from Sheridan County who has recently traveled domestically. The state health department said it is working \u201cto learn more details about the person\u2019s exposure risk and to identify and communicate with anyone who may have been in close contact with the patient.\u201d 44 states infected: That means 44 out of 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, have now reported coronavirus cases. The number of patients in the United States has doubled since Sunday. The new numbers bring the national total to 1,274 cases, including 70 cases of citizens repatriated from abroad. Canceling the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games would be \"unthinkable,\" Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said today. Speaking to reporters about the World Health Organization's (WHO) official declaration of a pandemic, Koike said: \"There will be an impact, but it is unthinkable that (the Olympics) would be canceled.\" Olympic organizers have insisted for the past month that preparations for the Games are proceeding as planned. On Thursday, the organizers said they were monitoring the situation. Here's their statement: \"The Organising Committee is aware of the World Health Organisation Director-General\u2019s remarks.\nAs we have done thus far, the Organising Committee, the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee will monitor the situation carefully while seeking the advice of the World Health Organisation.\nWe will continue to coordinate our response with the Government of Japan, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and other stakeholders as we prepare for a safe and secure delivery of the Tokyo 2020 Games in July this year.\" Cancelling or postponing the Games would be a massive and financially costly move -- but other major sporting events have been suspended amid the pandemic, including the NBA regular season. Tokyo 2020 is due to officially begin on July 24. ##Daily Life## Pope Francis dedicated Thursday\u2019s homily to Italian authorities, asking people to support the government during the coronavirus pandemic.  Authorities often feel \u201calone\u201d during times like these, but \u201cit\u2019s for everyone\u2019s common good,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cLet\u2019s pray for our leaders that have to take these decisions over these measures, let them feel supported by the people,\u201d he said. Italy was placed under total lockdown on Monday -- meaning schools are closed, movement restricted, events canceled, public services suspended, and many public spaces are empty as people stay home. Italy now has the most coronavirus cases outside of China. European shares have fallen sharply at the open, as investors react to new travel restrictions from the US. President Trump announced late Wednesday night local time that the US was suspending travel from 26 European countries for the next 30 days, effective Friday midnight. In the opening minutes of trade, Europe's main markets were all down. The FTSE 100 was down more than 2%, the German Dax was 5% lower and the French CAC 40 fell 3%.  Airline stocks were among the big fallers. IAG, owner of British Airways and Iberia, was down 7%, Lufthansa was down 9% and Ryanair was down nearly 10%. Shockwaves were felt in Asia too. Japan's\u00a0Nikkei 225\u00a0slipped into a bear market, defined as a drop of more than 20% from the most recent high. The benchmark index closed down 4.4%. Hong Kong's\u00a0Hang Seng Index\u00a0(HSI)\u00a0was last down 3.6%, while South Korea's\u00a0Kospi (KOSPI)\u00a0closed down 3.9%. Both indexes are flirting with bear market territory. These countries are affected: The 26 countries included in the ban are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\u00a0 ##Business## ##Travel## Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who turns 75 this month, will be tested for the coronavirus, according to a Facebook post by presidential aide Bong Go. Go said that both he and Duterte are undergoing testing to \u201censure that we are fit and healthy to engage the public and perform our duties.\" The decision was taken after some cabinet members were exposed to confirmed cases of the virus and are now under self-quarantine, according to the post. The\u00a0Philippines confirmed 15 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the national total to 35. Among 208 employees of a call center in Seoul, who all work on the same floor, 80 have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the South Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are also confirmed cases from other floors in the same building. The call center was identified as a new cluster earlier this week, with a spike in cases in Seoul after a few days of diminishing daily cases.  Some 553 other employees on different floors of the building are now under self-quarantine and are being tested, as health officials continue their investigation into the cluster transmission at the call center. The building has been closed and disinfected, and the area where it's located has been designated an \"infectious disease special zone.\" Health authorities are now trying to figure out whether the confirmed cases on different floors are linked or separate cases, according to Kwon Joon-wook, vice-director of the KCDC. The coronavirus has infected more than 124,500 people globally, according to the World Health Organization. Here's the breakdown: Global cases: 124,519\nGlobal deaths: 4,607\nCountries or territories with cases: 118 China remains the most heavily impacted country, with more than 80,000 cases, according to the WHO. Italy has the second highest number of cases, topping 12,000, and Iran follows, with around 9,000 cases. ##Health## Beijing has announced it will enforce a 14-day quarantine on all international travelers arriving in the Chinese capital, as the number of\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0cases outside Asia continues to rise. On Tuesday, Beijing reported six new confirmed cases -- all imported, including five from Italy and one from the United States. The move is one of several travel restrictions being introduced across the region, as governments step up efforts to prevent a surge in cross-border infections. The new ruling requires all passengers arriving in Beijing from overseas to self-quarantine, either at home or in a designated facility, for 14 days. International business travelers will be required to stay at a select number of designated hotels in Beijing where they will be tested for the virus. They will not be permitted to leave until their test results have been returned. It used to be the other way around: At the beginning of the pandemic, it was China and other Asian countries dealing with an exponential rise in cases and the ensuing travel restrictions enacted by countries and airlines around the world. Many of those restrictions are still in place -- but the tone of panic versus containment has completely flipped. China only reported 15 new cases yesterday -- six imported from overseas -- suggesting the virus was mostly contained within the country. By comparison, Italy is now under complete lockdown, 43 US states have confirmed cases, and every country in the European Union has reported infections, with numbers continuing to spike by hundreds every day.

The 30-day suspension, which begins Friday at midnight, marks a sharp escalation of measures taken to insulate Americans from the coronavirus outbreak. \"Temporarily shutting off travel from Europe is going to exacerbate the already-heavy impact of coronavirus on the travel industry and the 15.7 million Americans whose jobs depend on travel,\u201d said US Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow in a statement today.\u00a0 The travel restriction extends to countries in the Schengen zone, which includes Italy, Germany, France, Spain and 22 other nations. The United Kingdom is not included. Why this will hit hard: Thousands of Europeans visit America every month -- and during that time, they spend a lot of money. About 850,000 international visitors flying from Europe -- excluding the United Kingdom -- entered the United States in March 2019, accounting for about 29% of total overseas arrivals to the country, according to US Travel Association economists. Those visitors spent some $3.4 billion in the United States. US citizens and permanent residents who are in Europe will still be allowed back into the United States during the 30-day period, though will be screened upon entry and face quarantine or restrictions on their movement. Even so, it remains unclear whether airlines will still fly the routes if passenger demand from European nationals dries up because of the ban. ##Business## ##Travel## A 66-year-old Greek man is the first coronavirus patient to die in the country, the Greek Health Ministry said in a statement today.\u00a0 The Ministry said the man died around 3:15 a.m. local time today at a hospital in Patras. Greece has confirmed a total of 99 coronavirus cases.\u00a0\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence will be answering questions about the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus on CNN\u2019s New Day, which starts at 7:30 a.m. ET. The outbreak in the US has reached 43 states and the District of Columbia. President Donald Trump suspended travel from 26 European countries and announced additional measures late Wednesday night to help steady a rattled nation and diving markets. You can watch the show on air, on CNN and CNN.com and all digital platforms, and streaming devices on CNNgo. Viking Cruises announced today that it is temporarily suspending cruise operations until May, in response to the coronavirus situation.\u00a0 \"We have made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend operations of our river and ocean vessels embarking from\u00a0March 12 to April 30, 2020\u00a0\u2013 at which time we believe Viking will be in a better place to provide the experiences our guests expect and deserve,\" said the statement.\n\"This is a decision we made with a heavy heart, but with present circumstances what they are, we are unable to deliver the high-quality Viking experience for which we are known.\" The statement also said guests who already booked cruises during that period would be offered a voucher for a future cruise worth 125% the original cruise price, or a total refund for the amount paid. ##Travel## Staff from the Australian morning talk show \u201cToday Extra\u201d will be quarantined after coming into \u201cprolonged contact\u201d with actress and singer Rita Wilson, who was a guest on the program on Monday. The show airs on CNN\u2019s affiliated Nine Network. Rita Wilson and her husband Tom Hanks announced earlier today that they had contracted the coronavirus. The couple are now being treated in Australia's Queensland state, said the state premier. After the diagnosis, Nine Network enacted its \u201ccrisis response plan,\" it said in a statement. \"Today Extra\"\u00a0hosts David Campbell and Belinda Russell are now undergoing testing for the virus. Speaking on Radio 2GB today, Campbell added that he would pull his children . out of school while waiting for test results, and that Wilson \"didn't seem to have any symptoms of anything.\"\u00a0 A lot has happened in the past few hours. Here's the latest: This is now a pandemic: The World Health Organization has announced the new classification of the novel coronavirus as a pandemic, but cautioned that this doesn't mean the global health watchdog or individual countries will change their response. Calling it a pandemic just formally acknowledges that the virus is deadly, has spread worldwide, and has sustained person-to-person transmission.\nThe US has new travel restrictions: President Trump announced earlier today that travel from 26 countries to the US will be suspended for the next 30 days, beginning Friday at midnight. Several European ambassadors in the US say they had no warning of the announcement, and are still working to figure out what the restrictions mean.\nBasketball is on hold: The NBA is suspending its regular season, after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus. The test result was reported just before the tip-off of Wednesday night's game between the Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder at Chesapeake Energy Arena, which was immediately canceled.\nTom Hanks infected:\u00a0The two-time Academy Award winning actor and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, have been diagnosed with coronavirus and are being treated in Australia's Queensland state.\nCases rise worldwide: The US reported more cases today from several states -- 43 states and the District of Columbia have reported infections. Australia, India, China, and South Korea are among the countries also reporting new infections today. As cases rise, major events around the world are being canceled, schools are being suspended and classes moved online, and people are staying home under self quarantine. The United States has at least 1,272 cases of the coronavirus and 38 deaths, according to state and local health agencies and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 70 cases are repatriated citizens, like those evacuated from China or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. 1,202 cases were detected on US soil, spread out across 43 states and the District of Columbia. These include presumptive positive cases that are still pending final confirmation from the CDC labs. Charles Michel, the European Union's council president, tweeted that the EU would \"assess the situation today\" after President Trump's earlier announcement banning travel from 26 European countries to the US. \"Economic disruption must be avoided,\" Michel said in the tweet. Trump made the announcement in a televised address to the nation; European ambassadors in Washington say they weren't informed beforehand, and that the US State Department only began making calls to ambassadors with the news after Trump had spoken. ##Business## ##Travel## A total of 29 people have died after last week's collapse of a quarantine hotel in southeastern China, according to Chinese state media. A hotel being used as a coronavirus quarantine center collapsed Saturday night with 80 people inside the building when it came down. Nine people escaped, leaving 71 trapped under the rubble. All 71 are now accounted for, after nearly five days of search and rescue operations, according to state media.  At the time of the collapse, 58 of the 80 people were under quarantine in the hotel and all had tested negative for the novel coronavirus.  India has confirmed eight more coronavirus cases in the state of Maharashtra, according to the state's chief minister. Two of those cases were in the city of Mumbai, and six in Pune city. The patients are under observation in hospitals. That raises the state's total to 10 cases, and the national total to 68.  Maryland has announced three additional cases of coronavirus, bringing the state total to 12.  The three new cases are: A Montgomery County resident in his 20s who recently traveled to Spain, and is not hospitalized.\u00a0\nA Baltimore County resident in his 60s who worked at the recent American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference in Washington, DC, and is not hospitalized.\nA Prince George\u2019s County resident in his 60s whose travel history is under investigation, and is currently hospitalized. Last week, the AIPAC announced that some people may have become exposed to an infected case, including several political leaders at the conference in DC.\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence and many lawmakers and aides attended the conference.\u00a0 \u201cMarylanders should be taking this pandemic very seriously,\u201d said Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan in a news release. \u201cAll Marylanders need to understand that there may be significant disruption to your everyday lives for a period of time.\" American passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which was docked in California after infections were found onboard, landed early Thursday local time at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia. The passengers had been screened by the Department of Health and Human Services and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before arriving. They will now begin a 14-day quarantine as a precaution, in case they were exposed to the coronavirus aboard the ship. The CDC is responsible for all aspects of the quarantine operation, and Dobbins personnel will have no contact with these passengers\u00a0 The passengers who landed today are part of the second wave -- some passengers had been sent to Dobbins earlier this week, while others were sent to the Travis Air Force Base in California for their quarantine. ##Health## All Los Angeles City Council committee meetings will be canceled throughout March due to coronavirus concerns, said Council President Nury Martinez in a letter to council members on Wednesday. The city council will meet three times, but all other Wednesday and Friday meetings have been canceled in addition to all city council presentations. This comes after two nearby counties, Ventura and Riverside, confirmed new cases today. Actor Tom Hanks and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, are receiving treatment in Australia's Queensland state after testing positive for the coronavirus today, state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said at a news conference. \"Our experts will work very closely with him, (and) with all of the cast and crew,\" she added, stating that contract tracing is ongoing and anyone classified as a close contact will be isolated and tested for the virus. Quelling concerns over the couple\u2019s recent exposure to fans, Palaszczuk said, \"From what the chief health officer has told me it\u2019s over 15 minutes of being in close proximity. A selfie wouldn\u2019t count as that.\" Palaszczuk didn't divulge details of where the couple has been quarantined, but said, \"they will be getting the best treatment in our hospitals, just as we provide to everybody else\". She assured that their hospital is well equipped to handle their diagnosis, and that eight other coronavirus patients had been released from this hospital. She also called for public vigilance: The latest development \"clearly shows that coronavirus knows no boundaries,\" Palaszczuk warned, calling for the public to be prepared and informed. \"So, everyone, let\u2019s do the right thing, lets follow our health authorities.\" US Health and Human Services employees were warned yesterday of malware in a fake coronavirus mapping website, an HHS employee not authorized to speak on the record told CNN.\u00a0 \u201cA malicious website pretending to be a live map for coronavirus Covid-19 global cases by Johns Hopkins University is circulating on the Internet waiting for unwitting Internet users to visit the website,\u201d an email to employees read. The warning came in a department-wide correspondence that detailed the malware as an \"information stealing program which can exfiltrate a variety of sense of data,\u201d\u00a0adding that anyone searching for coronavirus information on the internet could unwittingly click on the fake map. \u201cOur cybersecurity team is working with numerous stakeholders to ensure this map is taken offline,\u201d the email read.\u00a0 HHS did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\u00a0 California confirmed two new coronavirus cases on Wednesday -- one in Ventura County, and one in Riverside County, both close to Los Angeles. That brings the state\u2019s total to 138 cases and four deaths. Ventura County case: The patient had traveled to Italy and was a presumptive positive case, meaning they had tested positive in public health labs. The patient remains under home quarantine in Ventura County. This is the county\u2019s second case. Riverside County case: There are no details available about the patient, except that this is the second locally-acquired case. The county has five cases in total. If United States officials are clear about one thing as they scramble to respond to the worsening coronavirus pandemic, it's where they feel the blame lies.\u00a0 Addressing the nation on Wednesday night, President Donald Trump emphasized that the \"foreign virus\" began \"in China.\" His comments come after multiple US lawmakers and officials have criticized Beijing's initial handling of the outbreak, or pointedly referred to the coronavirus as the \"Wuhan virus\" or \"China virus.\"\u00a0 Speaking earlier in the day, Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien said that \"this virus did not originate in the United States, it originated in Wuhan in Hubei province in China.\" \"Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,\" he added. \"It probably cost the world community two months to respond ... had a WHO team been on the ground, had a CDC team been on the ground -- as we offered -- I think we could have dramatically curtailed what has happened in China and the world.\" These statements couldn't have come at a worse time for Beijing, just as it is attempting to reframe the narrative around its response to the virus as one of success, and take something of a victory lap. New infections have slowed to a trickle, thanks largely to China's -- albeit often draconian, extreme -- response in recent weeks.\u00a0 Those moves however came as a rearguard action to a widely criticized initial response, including an apparent cover-up by officials in Wuhan, which may have cost precious time to rein in the virus before it spread through the country and the world.\u00a0 While there was a brief reckoning in China over these mistakes, particularly in the wake of the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, Beijing has begun pushing back hard against any criticism overseas and censoring discussion at home. State media has also started pushing the line that there is uncertainty where the virus originated, even though the first outbreak was undoubtedly in Wuhan.\u00a0 With US officials apparently determined to lay the blame at Beijing's door -- distracting from their own handling of the outbreak at home -- and their Chinese counterparts equally determined to avoid it, this argument will likely continue for some time.\u00a0 Australia now has a total of 126 coronavirus nationwide, the country\u2019s Ministry of Health said today.\u00a0 The death toll remains at three. \u00a0Here's how the cases break down across the states: New South Wales: 64\u00a0cases\nQueensland: 17 cases\nSouth Australia: 8 cases\nTasmania: 2 cases\nVictoria: 18 cases\nWestern Australia: 7 cases\nDiamond Princess cruise ship: 10 cases Australia has unveiled a 17.63 billion Australian dollars ($11.4 billion) economic stimulus plan, the country's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a news release on Thursday. The package includes wage subsidies and cash payments for small businesses, to counter the impact of the novel coronavirus. \u201cOur plan will back Australian households with a stimulus payment to boost growth, bolster domestic confidence and consumption, reduce cash flow pressures for businesses and support new investments to lift productivity\u201d, Morrison said. To achieve this the plan is split in four parts focusing on boosting business investment, providing cash flow for small and medium sized businesses, supporting affected communities and backing Australian households. \"Australia is not immune to the global coronavirus challenge but we have already taken steps to prepare for this looming international economic crisis,\" Morrison said\u00a0in the news release.\n\"Both this financial year and in the next two financial years, the gross impact of that stimulus is $14.82 billion US dollars (A$22.9 billion). That's 1.2% of GDP\". ##Business## Panic buying has been rife amid the global spread of the coronavirus, with shoppers stockpiling goods like toilet paper, hand sanitizer and canned food.\u00a0 In Japan, those who couldn\u2019t buy toilet paper have resorted to pilfering supplies from public restrooms.\u00a0 But one Japanese store has cursed its toilet rolls to prevent thefts.\u00a0 Mink Itachibe, who works at a convenience store in Niigata prefecture, noticed people stealing between three to five rolls of toilet paper each day. She sketched an image that shows three eyes and several kanji characters and stuck it up in front of the toilet rolls. Some store owners use images of eyes to give the impression that they are watching out for potential thieves, Itachibe told CNN. The kanji below imply that if someone takes the toilet paper from the store, a hungry monster will hunt them down and gobble them up.\u00a0 \u201cI did it as a joke, but it seems to have worked,\u201d Itachibe told CNN. \u201cAs people were stealing toilet paper, I wanted this to shock them and think they might get hexed. People can be quite superstitious in Japan.\u201d Itachibe has reported no thefts of toilet paper from her store since she put up the sketches.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## Prisons in California are suspending visiting due to the coronavirus, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) announced on its website today. \u201cNormal visiting will be canceled statewide until further notice,\u201d the department said. This includes non-contact visits, which occur with a glass partition between the inmate and their visitors. \u201cFamily visits will be held as scheduled,\u201d they added. These visits occur in private, apartment-like facilities on prison grounds, according to the CDCR. \"CDCR values visitation as an essential part of rehabilitation, but at this time the Department must make difficult decisions in order to protect the health and wellness of all who live in, work in, and visit state prisons,\" the statement said. ##Daily Life## The annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day\u00a0parade\u00a0in New York City has officially been canceled, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office.\u00a0 The statement said the governor had discussed the issue with the parade organizers, as coronavirus cases and anxieties ramp up in the city and state. \"Following those conversations, I recommended and the\u00a0parade's leadership agreed to postpone this year's\u00a0parade\u00a0due to the high density and the large volume of marchers and spectators who attend,\" said Cuomo in the statement.\n\"While I know the\u00a0parade\u00a0organizers did not make this decision lightly, public health experts agree that one of the most effective ways to contain the spread of the virus is to limit large gatherings and close contacts, and I applaud the\u00a0parade's leadership for working cooperatively with us.\" The parade was originally set to take place on March 17. New York now has 216 cases -- the second highest number of any state. Washington is the hardest-hit US state, with 373 cases and 30 deaths, and California follows New York, with 133 cases and four deaths, according to CNN's tally. ##Daily Life## South Korea confirmed six new deaths and 114 more cases of the novel coronavirus yesterday, according to the South Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).\u00a0 That raises the national death toll to 66 and the total confirmed cases to 7,869. The number represents a drop again in new daily cases -- on Monday, the country had recorded 131 new cases, the lowest single-day increase in weeks, sparking cautious hope that the worst of the outbreak may have passed. Then, a new cluster was identified in Seoul -- and the number of new cases shot up to 242 on Tuesday. The drop back down to 114 new cases on Wednesday appears to fall more in line with the previous downward trend. 73 cases were from Daegu: The southern city is at the heart of the national outbreak, and this is the lowest daily increase in Daegu since February 26. 8 cases were from North Gyeongsang province: This province surrounds Daegu -- about 89% of cases nationwide are from Daegu and North Gyeongsang combined. 19\u00a0cases were from Seoul: The capital has seen a recent rise, after a cluster was identified at a call center -- 102 cases had links to the office. The building where the call center is located has been closed and disinfected, and Seoul has designated the area an \"infectious disease special zone.\" A lot is happening right now in the US as organizations around the country prepare to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just tuning in, here's where things stand right now: US suspends travel from Europe:\u00a0President Trump announced Wednesday night that travel from 26 European countries will be suspended for the next 30 days, starting Friday at midnight. \n43 states now have coronavirus: North Dakota confirmed its first case today, making it the 43rd state (plus Washington, DC) to report coronavirus infections. \nTom Hanks infected:\u00a0The two-time Academy Award winning actor says he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, have been diagnosed with coronavirus.\u00a0In a statement posted to Instagram, Hanks said the two were traveling in Australia when they were tested.\u00a0\nNBA suspends season:\u00a0The NBA has announced Wednesday night that the season is being suspended after a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\nNumerous tournaments affected:\u00a0The NCAA\u2019s Big 12 and Big Ten conferences announced Wednesday that they will play their college basketball conference tournament games without fans in attendance. \nMore states declare state of emergencies:\u00a0As coronavirus continues to spread across the US, 23 states and Washington, DC, have declared a state of emergency. Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas and Washington, DC, all made their declarations Wednesday.\nCongressional staffer tests positive: An employee in Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell\u2019s office is the first publicly known case of a congressional staffer testing positive for coronavirus. The staffer had no known contact with Cantwell, who represents Washington state, or other members of Congress. There are at least\u00a01,267\u00a0cases of the coronavirus in the United States, according to state and local health agencies and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 70 cases are repatriated from overseas, like citizens evacuated from China or the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. 1,197 cases were detected and confirmed on US soil, spread out across 43 states and Washington, DC. These figures include presumptive positive cases -- meaning the patient tested positive in a public health lab and is pending confirmation from the CDC. The US death toll is now at 38, after another patient died in Washington state. Officials learned a player from Utah Jazz had tested positive coronavirus right before the tip-off of their game with Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, the Jazz said in a statement. The player's symptoms had \"diminished over the course\" of the day so a test for COVID-19 was performed, the team said. \"A preliminary positive result came back right before tip-off of the Utah Jazz-Oklahoma City game,\" the team statement said. \"Subsequently, the decision was correctly made by the NBA to postpone the game. When it was determined that the individual would be tested, we immediately informed the league office. The health and safety of our players, our organization, those throughout our league, and all those potentially impacted by this situation are paramount in our discussions.\" Because of the positive result, the game was postponed with the NBA later announcing that they were suspending the season.\u00a0\u00a0 The Jazz added that they are\u00a0\u201cworking closely with the CDC, Oklahoma and Utah state officials and the NBA to determine how to best move forward as we gather more information. The individual is currently in the care of health officials in Oklahoma City. In coordination with the NBA and state officials, we will provide updates at the appropriate time.\u201d Europe appears to have been largely blindsided by President Trump\u2019s announcement earlier today that the US was suspending travel from 26 European countries. Several European ambassadors in Washington tell CNN they didn\u2019t know this was coming, despite having been in contact with the administration over the past few days. One ambassador in DC said there was \u201cno indication\u201d Trump would go to the lengths he did, while another spokesperson said German officials had no advanced warning this was coming. \u201cWe knew something was coming on travel from Europe (more restrictive travel advice) but not this drastic,\" the Belgian ambassador told CNN. \"What is not understandable is the exception for the UK and the lack of national measures [domestically].\u201d The Trump administration notified ambassadors after the announcement: Several European ambassadors expressed a need for clarity as they worked to digest what these new measures mean. They had received calls from the State Department after the announcement -- but they \"have not yet answers to our questions,\u201d said one ambassador. State Department officials say they didn\u2019t know precisely what Trump was going to roll out, given the fact that multiple options were on the table.\u00a0 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the Australian Foreign Minister less than five hours before Trump\u2019s address -- and gave no indication of the announcement coming tonight, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Pompeo did acknowledge that things were going to continue to be painful, and increasingly so, for the next six weeks or so. ##Travel## Mainland China reported 15 new coronavirus cases yesterday -- continuing the week-long trend of dramatically falling numbers, according to China's National Health Commission. Six of those cases were imported from overseas -- meaning they weren't locally transmitted in China. Hubei province, where the coronavirus pandemic began back in December, reported eight new cases -- the lowest to be reported from Hubei since the outbreak\u00a0began. The drop in new daily cases is especially striking given that just a month or two ago, the country was reporting around 2,000 new cases per day. China has now reported 80,793 cases and 3,169 deaths. Of the total cases, 62,793 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the NHC.\u00a0 ##Health## In a primetime address to millions of Americans, President Trump misrepresented the travel restrictions he is imposing on travel between the United States and Europe. Trump said \"we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days\" before adding that there will be \"exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.\" Those exemptions are far more extensive than the President made them out to be.\u00a0They apply to all US legal permanent residents, citizens and some of their family members, according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security.\u00a0 The travel restrictions Trump is enacting are in fact far more similar to those enacted on China. The ban also does not apply to all of\u00a0Europe\u00a0but to nations in the Schengen zone. That includes\u00a0Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\u00a0 What this means: Americans and US permanent residents who are in Europe will still be allowed to fly to Europe and be allowed back into the United States during this 30-day period.\u00a0 They will simply be screened upon entry to the United States and face quarantine or restrictions on their movement in the US for 14 days.\u00a0 However, it is not\u00a0clear whether airlines will still fly the routes if passenger demand from European nationals dries up because\u00a0of the ban.\u00a0 Trump also\u00a0appeared to correct himself on a ban on cargo.\u00a0In his speech he said, \"There will be\u00a0exemptions for\u00a0Americans who have undergone\u00a0appropriate screenings\u00a0and these\u00a0prohibitions will not only\u00a0apply\u00a0to the tremendous amount of\u00a0trade and cargo, but various\u00a0other things as we get approval.\u00a0\"\u00a0 A few minutes\u00a0ago, the President\u00a0tweeted, \"...please remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.\"\u00a0 This is not to say the President is not taking an extremely severe step, but it is not the all-encompassing suspension on travel between the United States and Europe that the President portrayed. ##Travel## President Trump will no longer travel to Colorado and Nevada at the end of the week.\u00a0 \u201cOut of an abundance of caution from the coronavirus outbreak, the President has decided to cancel his upcoming events in Colorado and Nevada,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\u00a0 ##Travel## The NBA has announced that the season is being suspended after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus. Read the NBA's full statement: The NBA announced that a player on the Utah Jazz has preliminarily tested positive for COVID-19.\u00a0The test result was reported shortly prior to the tip-off of tonight\u2019s game between the Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder at Chesapeake Energy Arena.\u00a0At that time, tonight\u2019s game was canceled.\u00a0The affected player was not in the arena.\nThe NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight\u2019s schedule of games until further notice.\u00a0The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic. Sports world hit by virus: This is the latest -- and largest -- cancellation of a sporting event yet. Other sports events have also been affected by coronavirus; NCAA basketball announced that March Madness would be played to an empty stadium with no fans, soccer matches in Europe have been postponed or played behind closed doors, and there are calls to cancel the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, despite organizers' insistence that the Games will go ahead. ##Daily Life## Actor Tom Hanks says he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, have been diagnosed with coronavirus.\u00a0 In a statement posted to Instagram, Hanks said the two were traveling in Australia when they were tested.\u00a0 \"Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\" Hanks wrote.\u00a0 A representative for actor Tom Hanks told CNN the statement posted on Hanks\u2019 Instagram account on Wednesday is \"correct.\" Hanks shared the following image and message on Instagram: President Trump announced tonight that all travel from Europe to the United States will be suspended for the next 30 days, except for the UK. Trump made the decision in order to \"keep new cases from entering\u00a0our shores.\" \"We will be\u00a0suspending all travel from\u00a0Europe to the United States for\u00a0the next 30 days.\u00a0The new rules will go into\u00a0effect Friday at midnight.\u00a0These restrictions will be\u00a0adjusted subject to conditions\u00a0on the ground,\" the President said from the Oval Office. Trump said there will be exemptions made for certain Americans \"who have undergone\u00a0appropriate screenings.\" \"These\u00a0prohibitions will not only apply\u00a0to the tremendous amount of\u00a0trade and cargo, but various\u00a0other things as we get approval.\u00a0Anything coming from Europe to\u00a0the United States is what we are\u00a0discussing.\u00a0These restrictions will also not\u00a0apply to the United Kingdom,\" Trump added. ##Travel## El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced a nationwide 21-day mandatory quarantine in a televised address to the nation late Wednesday.\u00a0 Bukele explained all school activities at all levels are now suspended and any gatherings of more than 500 people will be prohibited.\u00a0 The 21 days of quarantine will not impact trade and \u201call people should continue to go to work as usual,\u201d Bukele said. All diplomats, Guatemalans with valid passports and Salvadoran residents will be allowed into the country as long as they undergo the mandatory isolation, according to the president.\u00a0 Currently, El Salvador does not have any confirmed cases of novel coronavirus. ##Travel## Robert O\u2019Brien, President Trump\u2019s\u00a0national\u00a0security\u00a0adviser, blasted\u00a0the\u00a0Chinese government for\u00a0their\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0outbreak in Wuhan, saying\u00a0they \u201ccovered up\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0outbreak and \u201cprobably\u201d\u00a0cost\u00a0the\u00a0world\u00a0\u201ctwo months\u00a0to\u00a0respond.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s lots of open source reporting from\u00a0China, from Chinese\u00a0nationals that\u00a0the\u00a0doctors involved were either silenced or, or put in isolation or that sort of thing so word of this virus could not get out,\u201d O\u2019Brien\u00a0told a crowd at\u00a0the\u00a0Heritage Foundation in Washington. \u201cIf we had those and been able\u00a0to\u00a0sequence\u00a0the\u00a0virus and had\u00a0the\u00a0cooperation necessary from\u00a0the\u00a0Chinese, had a WHO team been on\u00a0the\u00a0ground, had a CDC team which we\u2019d offered been on\u00a0the\u00a0ground, I think we could\u2019ve dramatically curtailed what happened both in\u00a0China\u00a0and what\u2019s now happening across\u00a0the\u00a0world,\u201d he continued. O\u2019Brien also\u00a0urged Americans\u00a0to\u00a0heed\u00a0the\u00a0warnings of\u00a0the US\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and take precautions\u00a0to\u00a0prevent further spread of\u00a0coronavirus. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a coworker who sneezes, send\u00a0them home,\u201d he said, adding that people should practice social distancing, wash\u00a0their hands routinely, and take other protective measures.\u00a0 O\u2019Brien, whose speech notably drew a smaller-than-usual crowd amid fears of crowded places, described\u00a0the\u00a0President\u2019s\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0outbreak in\u00a0the\u00a0US as \u201ccourageous,\u201d particularly for his decision\u00a0to\u00a0temporarily freeze air travel\u00a0to\u00a0highly affected areas.\u00a0 The\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0has currently spread\u00a0to\u00a0six continents, roiled financial and oil markets and led\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0cancellation of events, classes and other gatherings across\u00a0the\u00a0country. ##Health##"], "Language": false}
