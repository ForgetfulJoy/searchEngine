Singapore recorded 49 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Thursday, only eight of which had a travel history to Europe, North America or other parts of Asia. Some 26 of the remaining new cases are linked to previous patients or community infection clusters, according to a Ministry of Health news release. Fifteen of the new infections are currently unlinked and contact tracing is ongoing. Overall, there have been 1,049 recorded cases of the novel coronavirus in Singapore since the outbreak began. Like many other Asian countries, Singapore is currently experiencing a second wave of infections after bringing its initial outbreak more or less under control. As of April 3, 266 confirmed coronavirus patients have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals and community isolation facilities across Singapore.  Of the 779 cases still being treated in hospitals across the city, 23 are in critical condition. Four cases have died from complications due to the coronavirus according to the Ministry of Health. ##Health## CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta's two-hour special on the coronavirus pandemic has concluded.  Scroll below for some of the highlights from the meeting. Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, recently purchased 1.2 million N95 protective masks to donate to the state of Massachusetts and another 300,000 for New York state.  He joined CNN's coronavirus town hall to explain how it got done.  Kraft explained that his eldest son, who is the chairman of the board of Massachusetts General Hospital, is close with the state's governor, Charlie Baker. Baker asked if there was a way that the state could get the masks bought in China. So Kraft offered to use the team's jet, which was sitting idle. \"This was probably the most\u00a0challenging operation our\u00a0organization and team ever had\u00a0to do.\u00a0It was a lot of red tape,\u00a0but a lot of people cooperated,\" he said.\n\"Our crew flew probably more\u00a0hours than they should have,\u00a0but they knew how important it\u00a0was. It's like doing your job and\u00a0never taking time off when\u00a0something is really important.\" Kraft said he believes both Baker and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was on CNN at the time, were both doing a great job. Gov. Cuomo said the call he got from Kraft saying they were getting the extra masks was probably \"the only good call I've gotten in about 10 days.\"  Watch: ##Business## Japan reported 235 new cases of the novel coronavirus today, bringing the total number of recorded cases in the country to 3,329. The East Asian country also reported three new coronavirus-related deaths. Tokyo had its largest single-day rise yet, with 97 new cases. The number of cases reported in the capital is now 684. Japan\u2019s national total includes 2,617 cases on land and 712 related to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in Yokohama Bay for two weeks in February. A total of 74 people have died from Covid-19 in Japan, including 63 on land and 11 related to the Diamond Princess. ##Health## Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 response, chimed in on the current debate about when to wear face masks and who should be wearing them.  \"What we recommend is that people who are sick wear masks -- medical masks, not N95 masks with respirators. Those must be reserved for our frontline workers who are caring for patients,\" she said. \"We also need people who are caring for those who are sick to be wearing the masks,\" she said. She said right now, it's crucial that personal protective equipment in short supply be reserved for medical workers.  \"We have to prioritize the use\u00a0of masks for frontline workers,\u00a0if that is one thing I can\u00a0stress.\u00a0Medical masks, respirators,\u00a0gloves, gowns, these are people\u00a0who are putting their lives on\u00a0the line to help us, to care\u00a0for other people and they must\u00a0be protected,\" she said. The WHO has been one of the strongest holdouts when it comes to recommending the widespread use of masks. US health officials recommended the same, but may be shifting course. On Monday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert\u00a0Redfield,\u00a0told NPR that his organization was reviewing its guidelines and\u00a0may recommend general mask use\u00a0to guard against community infection. Trump said the US plans to release new recommendations on face masks in the coming days.  When asked about President Trump's suggestion that people use facial coverings like scarves, Van Kerkhove said the WHO is investigating. \"We are constantly looking at\u00a0evidence, all the time, for the\u00a0use of masks for anything that\u00a0is related to this and related\u00a0to health issues.\u00a0We are talking with scientists\u00a0around the world, including US\u00a0CDC scientists,\" she said.

Dr. Leana Wen, the former Baltimore health commissioner, said currently there is no evidence that the coronavirus can spread long distances. However, she added that the virus could spread through a defective plumbing system. This was a particular concern in Hong Kong. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, this method became a major source of transmission. At the\u00a0Amoy Gardens\u00a0housing estate, there were more than 300 infections and 42 deaths after defective plumbing allowed the virus to spread through the building.  Dr. Wen recommended that \"buildings should make sure\u00a0that they check their exhaust systems, their pipe systems. And I think for all of us who live in\u00a0apartment buildings, there are\u00a0additional steps you can take as\u00a0well, including don't get\u00a0into crowded elevators.\u00a0Try to make sure you are not\u00a0in an elevator with someone.\" Dr. Wen also recommended opening the windows to increase your own ventilation once the weather gets warmer and to wash your hands thoroughly after touching surfaces that are used often, like handrails or buttons in elevators.  Watch: ##Health## Peru will allow men and women out on separate days as part of a gender-based quarantine measure designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country. The new measures will begin in Peru today, President Martin Vizcarra announced to the nation on Thursday. So far, Peru has reported 1,414 cases of coronavirus and 55 deaths. \"Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,\" only men can be outside; \"Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, only women are allowed to circulate,\" said Vizcarra. The gender-based measure will be in effect until Sunday, April 12. It comes two days after Panama began restricting movement by gender, arguing the measure urges people to return home since their loves ones are not allowed to be outside. Peru said it would adopt the same system following the positive results the gender-based measure has yielded in other countries and due to its simplicity in visually detecting who should and shouldn't be out on the streets, Vizcarra explained. ##Daily Life## Cheryl from Jacksonville, Florida, asked CNN's coronavirus town hall if Covid-19 can be contracted by ingesting it from produce at a supermarket. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said that since the virus is respiratory, you can't get it from contaminated food.  \"It's more of a question of the\u00a0packaging.\u00a0You just have to think about,\u00a0is there any risk of\u00a0contamination in other ways. But\u00a0you are not going to get a GI\u00a0type thing from eating the\u00a0virus.\u00a0 Watch below for a guide on how to sanitize your groceries: ##Health## Wayne Whitcomb, an engineer from North Hampton, New Hampshire, asked CNN's coronavirus town hall participants if cell phones are contributing to the spread of the virus. \"As we touch our phones frequently, but probably don't think to disinfect our phones as often as we wash our hands, I haven't seen any discussion or guidance given on this topic and wonder if you think it's a real concern. How should we properly disinfect our phones as part of our routine precautions?\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said phones are probably \"the most common surface that we touch.\"  \"Cleaning the phone, and wiping the phone ... is a good idea. I've been doing that pretty regularly,\" he said. Gupta also said that hospital doctors often put their phones in plastic bags to keep them a bit cleaner.  Watch: ##Health## ##Daily Life## At CNN's coronavirus town hall, viewer Robin in Riverside, California, asked top public health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci: \"If we've been under stay-at-home orders for two weeks, why is the peak still yet to come?\" Fauci,\u00a0the country's top medical expert on the coronavirus pandemic and a member of President Trump's coronavirus task force, said that it's in part because there is a delay in seeing the order's effect, despite knowing that the virus' incubation period can be up to two weeks \"Even when you suppress or\u00a0stabilize the number of new\u00a0infections, it's still going to take\u00a0a little while before you\u00a0decrease in hospitalizations, a\u00a0decrease in intensive care and\u00a0a decrease and deaths.\u00a0And in fact, deaths are the last thing that lag. So you could be doing well, and having a good effect on mitigation, and still see the deaths go up,\" Fauci said. \"I guarantee, that's exactly what's going to happen in New York City.\" Watch: ##Health## At CNN's coronavirus town hall, a viewer asks Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, if warm weather will help slow or stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's what Fauci said: \"In general, viruses that are\u00a0respiratory-borne tend to\u00a0peter out a bit as you get into the warmer,\u00a0moist weather, because viruses like cold/dry versus warm/moist.\n\"But that's not going to guarantee that that's happening\u00a0because we have parts of our\u00a0own country -- you know in\u00a0Florida, where the weather is warm.\u00a0Florida is now what  Washington, DC, is going to be is in a few months.\u00a0So we can't count on that.\u00a0\n\"I think there will be some\u00a0effect. I think when the country, as a\u00a0country, gets into the summer,\u00a0that we're going to get some positive\u00a0effect.\u00a0But we really can't rely on that\u00a0being the mechanism where we\u00a0get out of that.\u00a0We just have to assume it will\u00a0not help, and still continue to\u00a0push on social distancing.\u00a0\n\"Outside the United States, places in the southern hemisphere or that have warm climate year-round are also proving telling examples of whether this theory is true.\" Read more about them here: ##Health## Dr. Anthony Fauci,\u00a0the country's top medical expert on the coronavirus pandemic and a member of President Trump's coronavirus task force, said that standing 6-feet (1.8 meters) from other people will help prevent the transmission of coronavirus. Fauci said tonight during CNN's coronavirus town hall that he would not tell people to change their behavior in terms of outdoor activities. \"This brings up a number of\u00a0issues.\u00a0First, it underscores why you\u00a0should continue to try and stay\u00a06 feet away from someone.\u00a0That would alleviate that\u00a0immediately.\u00a0The other thing it brings up,\u00a0and that you brought up on this\u00a0show, is the question on\u00a0whether the people should be\u00a0wearing some sort of facial\u00a0cloth or covering.\u00a0Not taking masks away from\u00a0people like health care\u00a0providers but that clearly\u00a0generates a question,\" Fauci said. Watch: ##Health## Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joined CNN's town hall Thursday to discuss the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Fauci said he believes that there should be a federally mandated stay-at-home order, something President Donald Trump has been loathe to do. \"I don't understand why that's not\u00a0happening.\u00a0As you said, the tension\u00a0between federally mandated versus\u00a0states rights to do what they\u00a0want is something I don't want\u00a0to get into.\u00a0But if you look at what is going on\u00a0in this country, I do not\u00a0understand why we are not doing\u00a0that.\u00a0We really should be,\" Fauci said.  Trump said Wednesday that he does not plan to issue such an order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases. \u201cStates are\u00a0different and I understand that\u00a0the governor of Florida, great\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis issued one today and that\u2019s good, that\u2019s great.\u00a0But there are some states that are\u00a0different.\u00a0There are some states that don't\u00a0have much of a problem,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states depending on how bad individual states situations might be. \u201cYou have to look -- you have to\u00a0give a little\u00a0flexibility.\u00a0If you have a state in the\u00a0Midwest, or if Alaska for\u00a0example doesn't have a problem,\u00a0it's awfully tough to say close it down.\u00a0We have to have a little bit of\u00a0flexibility,\u201d Trump said. Watch: ##Health## A group of firefighters with the FDNY showed up at Elmhurst Hospital\u00a0in Queens today to thank and cheer on medical professionals for all their work fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The firefighters showed up during as shift change, correspondent Erica Hill said tonight during CNN's coronavirus town hall. \"The health care workers were\u00a0visibly moved.\u00a0The firefighters, so\u00a0appreciative and moved.\u00a0I have to say, witnessing it,\u00a0or it was really quite a moment\u00a0to see,\" Hill said. Some context: Elmhurst Hospital in Queens\u00a0has become an apocalyptic illustration of a nation in crisis, its doctors and nurses struggling to keep up with a surge of infections.  Watch the moment:  Dr. Deborah Birx said she can tell by looking at the US curve of coronavirus cases that not every American is following the guidelines set out by the administration for people to stay home and be vigilant about washing their hands. \u201cJust to everybody out there across the country \u2014 when we say no gatherings of 10, we want to be clear \u2014 if you have a family of 10, we don\u2019t want you to be split up,\u201d Birx said, while noting that the guidelines mean people should be having\u00a0\u201cno dinner parties, no cocktail parties.\u201d Birx, who serves as the task force's response coordinator, said\u00a0\u201cI know you\u2019ve seen the slope on the US versus the slope in Italy, and we have to change that slope,\u201d adding,\u00a0\u201cWhat it means in the US is not everyone is doing it.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re only as strong as every community, every county, every state, every American following the guidelines to a T,\u201d Birx said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I can tell by the curve \u2026 that not every American is following it.\u201d President Trump has approved a disaster declaration for Tennessee in response to coronavirus.  This is the 35th\u00a0such declaration Trump has made in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including 30 states, the\u00a0US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta are hosting a two-hour special tonight on the coronavirus pandemic. There is no audience tonight due to ongoing concerns around the coronavirus.  CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta will host a two-hour special tonight focusing on the coronavirus. The town hall will begin at 8 p.m. ET. Facing a complete standstill across its entertainment empire due to the coronavirus crisis, the Walt Disney Company notified its employees that it would furlough employees \"whose jobs aren't necessary at this time\" starting on April 19. Disney has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic. Its theme parks around the world have shuttered, its cruise line is suspended and many of its biggest films of the year have been delayed. Live sporting events, the lifeblood of the Disney-owned ESPN, have also been suspended.  Shares of Disney have plummeted more than 30% year to date. The impact is hitting Disney's theme park employees especially hard. All of Disney's 12 theme parks have been shuttered since March 12, after which the company committed to paying salaries through April 18.  In the statement, the company said there was \"no clear indication of when we can restart our businesses,\" and that it was \"forced to make the difficult decision to take the next step and furlough employees.\"\u00a0 Among those impacted would be the Disney Parks' storied \"Imagineers,\" the designers of the parks, rides and hotels. The furloughed workers would remain employees of the company and keep their health benefits, while also being able to access federal and state aid like unemployment benefits.\u00a0 For third day in a row,\u00a0Brazil's health authorities reported a consecutive spike of more than 1,000 new novel coronavirus cases in a single day. During a press conference on Thursday, 1,074 new cases were announced, bringing the country's total number of cases to 7,910 and 299 deaths. Some context: On Wednesday, Brazil reported 1,119 new cases, and on Tuesday, 1,138 were announced. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator for the White House's coronavirus task force, said the task force is missing 50% of the testing data for coronavirus tests that have been conducted. Birx said that part of the economic stimulus measure,\u00a0that was signed into law,\u00a0requires that all tests conducted get reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but said she has not received that data yet. \u201cWell I'm telling you, I'm still\u00a0missing 50% of the data from\u00a0reporting. I have 660 (thousand) tests\u00a0reported in.\u00a0We've done 1.3 million, so there\u00a0is, and it could be those sites,\u00a0so we do need to see, the bill\u00a0said you need to report.\u00a0We are still not receiving 100%\u00a0of the tests,\" she said. When pressed about the possibility that one in three tests had produced false negatives, Birx said, \u201cI haven't seen that kind of\u00a0anomaly.\u201d Birx added that \u201cthe\u00a0number of positive tests is\u00a0tracking very closely with a\u00a0number of cases diagnosed.\u201d Watch: An Oahu resident is the second person in Hawaii to die of coronavirus, according to the state's Department of Health. The deaths come as the state has taken unprecedented steps to avoid spread of the virus, including asking tourists to stay away for 30 days, with everyone entering the state or traveling between islands required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell did not provide details Thursday on the person who died, but did say the local government is now asking all residents to wear masks when they go out in public.\u00a0 The mayor says people should not buy surgical-quality masks, but instead should use simple or homemade masks so that there will not be a run on supplies that are critical to healthcare workers. \u00a0 With more than 1,000 cases added in one day, there are now 9,191 people in California with coronavirus and 203 have died as a result of Covid-19, according to a release from the California Department of Public Health. Nearly 2,000 people in California are hospitalized, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Of those, 816 people are in intensive care units. Despite the 5.4% increase in the past day, Newsom says those numbers are well within California\u2019s current capacity to treat. More than 92,400 people in California have been tested, but results for at least 59,500 are still pending, the state health department says.\u00a0 Cases in Los Angeles alone have climbed to over 4,000.\u00a0 There are 4,045 people who have been infected with coronavirus in Los Angeles County and a total of 78 deaths, according to Health Director Barbara Ferrer. Roughly two-thirds of those hospitalized with coronavirus have been otherwise healthy individuals with no underlying health conditions. Ferrer emphasized that they are seeing people suffering very serious illness due to the coronavirus. Announcing 534 new cases on Thursday, Ferrer points out that more than 1,000 cases have come in just the past two days. President Trump tonight was asked whether Americans should wear masks to protect themselves from the coronavirus and again suggested scarves, saying \"If people wanted to wear them they can. In many ways, the scarf is better. It's thicker.\" Trump also said a new guideline on masks is coming.\u00a0 \"I think they're going to be coming out with regulations on that. And if people want to abide by them, frankly, I don't think they'll be mandatory. Because some people don't want to do that. But If people want to \ufffd\ufffd as an example on the masks \u2014 if people wanted to wear them they can,\" Trump said.\u00a0 Two people familiar told CNN that upon recommendation from the Coronavirus Task Force, the President was expected to more forcefully encourage all Americans to wear face coverings outside their house. Some more background: The administration was working Thursday to complete the recommendations, which would advise Americans to use a face covering when leaving their homes. However, Trump said Thursday night,\u00a0\"A recommendation is coming out. We'll see what that recommendation is but I will say this: They can pretty much decide for themselves right now. CNN reported on Wednesday that most members the task force have come to agree that Americans should begin wearing face coverings in public and could issue formal guidance on the matter soon. Watch: Peter Navarro said President Donald Trump will sign an additional order that will crack down on price gouging related to personal protective equipment.  \u201cThere is a black market which you have described, where we\u2019re having people bid against each other, brokers come in, they\u2019re bidding and bidding on all this different (personal protective equipment),\u201d Navarro, the White House\u2019s Defense Production Act policy coordinator, said during the White House briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s driving the price up and guess what? You know where it\u2019s going? The domestic sources here are being exported.\u201d Navarro said the order will \u201cempower Customs and Border Protection with the help of the people at the post office and express mail consigners like UPS to basically deal with that issue.\u201d \u201cWe are going to crack down unmercifully,\u201d he added. New York City has 49,707 coronavirus cases and 1,562 deaths,\u00a0according to the city\u2019s website. So far, there have been 4,000 new cases today and 188 new deaths. New York City needs 1,000 nurses, 300 respiratory therapists and 150 doctors by Sunday, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. The city has received 400 ventilators from New York State, the mayor said, and will need roughly 3,000 ventilators for the next week and 15,000 overall, according to de Blasio. President Trump said New York City's Javits Center will be turned into a coronavirus treatment center, following a request from the state's Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\u00a0 \u201cGov. Cuomo has asked that\u00a0the facility ... be\u00a0converted to a Covid hospital.\u00a0We had not done that yet.\u00a0We had not thought in terms of\u00a0doing that,\" Trump said during the White House press briefing Thursday. \"But their use is the real demand\u00a0is for that.\u00a0And we had meetings on it with\u00a0the task force.\u00a0We had meetings with the\u00a0military.\u00a0And I decided to say yes, I am\u00a0going to do that.\u201d\u00a0 The Army Corps of Engineers along with civilian staffers from the federal government have been working around the clock to convert the convention center into a working hospital. Watch: President Donald Trump said Thursday in additional to the issuance of a memorandum invoking the Defense Production Act to supply ventilator supplies to manufacturers, he has also invoked the act against 3M for face masks.\u00a0 \u201cI just signed against 3M for face masks,\u201d Trump said during the White House press briefing. \u201cWe signed an element of the act against 3M. Hopefully they\u2019ll be able to do what they are supposed to do.\u201d 3M, which is the\u00a0largest maker of medical face masks and more specifically the N95 respirator mask, said in a statement earlier this week that it\u00a0already doubled its global output in January, and also plans \"to double our capacity once again, to 2 billion globally within the next 12 months \u2013 and some of that additional capacity will begin to come online in the next 60-90 days.\"\u00a0 In the US,\u00a03M\u00a0said it\u00a0expects to produce 50 million\u00a095 respirators\u00a0per month in June, a 40 percent jump from current levels. Even with accelerated production, the company's CEO Mike Roman acknowledged in a statement that \"the reality is that demand for N95 respirators is much higher than the industries\u2019 ability to deliver. That is why we continue to explore innovative partnerships and solutions to help protect our healthcare workers in this extraordinary time.\" Watch: American Airlines is making multiple cuts to its schedule for this coming summer and winter \u2014 another sign from the aviation industry that it expects a long-lasting drag from the coronavirus and economic slump.\u00a0\u00a0 The cuts include suspending plans for new service additions until 2021, and suspending about 60% if its international capacity this summer, the company said in a news release. Projections from industry groups have indicated the decline in demand for air travel will likely extend into next year.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Business## The Health and Human Services Department said Thursday it used its authority under the Defense Production Act to distribute roughly 192,000 N95 respirator masks and a large haul of other scarce medical supplies that the FBI seized during the arrest of a Brooklyn man.\u00a0 These supplies were distributed to healthcare workers in New York and New Jersey, HHS said. Baruch Feldheim, 43, was arrested Monday after he allegedly coughed on FBI agents and told them he had the coronavirus. Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Feldheim sold the N95 masks to doctors and nurses at inflated prices; in one instance at as much as a 700% markup.\u00a0\u00a0 Justice Department prosecutors in Newark charged him with assaulting federal officers and making false statements to law enforcement.\u00a0\u00a0 Feldheim kept the items in a repair shop in Irvington, New Jersey, which contained enough materials to outfit an entire hospital, a doctor who purchased masks from Feldheim told authorities.\u00a0\u00a0 FBI agents, as part of the Justice Department's Covid-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force, seized the items, which in addition to the N95 masks also included: 598,000 medical-grade gloves, 130,000 surgical and other masks, surgical gowns, disinfectant towels, particulate filters, and bottles of hand sanitizer and spray disinfectants, the Justice Department and HHS said in a press release.\u00a0 Mayor Bill de Blasio said he told President Trump during a phone call Thursday that \u201ca full mobilization of the military is needed\" in New York City. \u201cI just think this is the only way we are all going to be able to get through this, and save as many lives as possible, is to use the military much more deeply,\u201d de Blasio added. Calling the coronavirus pandemic a wartime dynamic, de Blasio said, \u201cEveryone in Washington has to understand that right now, too much of what\u2019s happening is on a peacetime basis.\u201d De Blasio says he also told the President that it\u2019s time to enlist medical personnel on a national basis. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same kind of draft we used to have. But we\u2019re gonna have to create something new, right now, at this moment in history, to enlist all available medical personnel from around the country with medical training \u2014 and I mean civilians \u2014 anyone with medical training, anywhere in the country, who can be spared by their city, their town, their state, to come to to the front,\u201d de Blasio added. \u201cAnd right now it\u2019s New York City.\u201d Broward County Mayor Dale Holness said they will allow passage of 1,200 guests from the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships who are fit to travel per CDC guidelines. The guests will go straight from the port to the airport tarmac to a chartered flight home. There will be four charter flights leaving on Friday and a fifth flight on Saturday. The passengers will go through two sets of screenings and be cleared by Customs and Border Protection. Approximately 38 passengers that live in Florida will be provided private transportation to their home. All individuals will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival at their home. About 26 passengers who are displaying Covid-19 symptoms will stay on board the ship until they are able to travel. Thirteen passengers and one crew member will be taken to Broward Health. \u201cWe have taken every precaution necessary to protect and the well-being and health of the people of Broward County while at the same time being humanitarians,\u201d Holness said. President Trump announced a new set of guidelines for nursing homes to combat coronavirus in addition to previous guidance from the administration that instructed nursing homes not to allow medically unnecessary visitors. Trump said the administration would recommend\u00a0\u201call nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently\u201d to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, the President said the administration would recommend that nursing homes \u201cdesignate separate areas for healthy and sick residents.\u201d Trump said this is a practice that health agencies were likely to continue recommending \u201clong into the future.\u201d His guidelines come after more than 140 nursing homes across the country have been hit by Covid-19.  Watch: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced the state is working on plans to convert the fairgrounds in Louisville into a 2,000-bed field hospital for coronavirus patients. He said the state is working on doing this with the help of the Army Corps of Engineers. He also issued a new executive order Thursday that requests visitors traveling to Kentucky to quarantine for 14 days. The temporary hospital facility at the Javits Convention Center will now treat Covid-19 patients, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced this afternoon.\u00a0 \u201cThe state-owned Javits Center has been turned into a 2,500-bed emergency medical facility being run by the US Army. The original plan for Javits was that it be used to take non-Covid patients from hospitals to open up hospital beds,\u201d Cuomo announced. \u201cHowever, the number of Covid positive patients has increased so dramatically that it would be beneficial to the state if Javits could accept Covid positive patients.\" Cuomo added: \"I asked President Trump this morning to consider the request and the urgency of the matter, and the President has just informed me that he granted New York's request. I thank the President for his cooperation in this pressing matter and his expeditious decision making.\" President Trump's new chief of staff Mark Meadows has created a \"coronavirus hotline\" for lawmakers so they can call directly with concerns about the outbreak that are affecting their states or constituents, an official told CNN.  John Fleming, a former lawmaker and his new deputy chief of staff, will run the hotline.\u00a0 The White House sent a letter to congressional leadership alerting them to the hotline today.  Lawmakers can call the number with emergency requests about coronavirus efforts in case they have an issue that needs to be expedited outside the formal channels of the task force.\u00a0 President Trump tested negative for the novel coronavirus for a second time, according to a memo from White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released to reporters in the briefing room moments before the President walked in for his daily briefing. Grisham's note said he was tested this morning and received the results 15 minutes later. Watch: New Yorkers are now advised to wear a face covering when outside and near other people, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a press conference today. De Blasio stressed that it does not mean that New Yorkers should wear a medical mask when outside and that they should be left for healthcare workers. \u201cIt could be a scarf. It could be something you create at home like a bandana,\" de Blasio said. The guidance come after a study was released yesterday about asymptomatic spread of coronavirus. \u201cWhen you wear the face covering you are protecting everyone else,\u201d de Blasio added. The order to wear a face covering does not replaces social distancing orders, de Blasio said. ##Daily Life## New York state will conduct a nightly, hospital-by-hospital, supply inventory survey to see how each hospital is stocked when it comes to supplies needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced today. \u201cSupplies are an ongoing challenge. The PPE is an ongoing challenge. The gowns, the gloves and the ventilators,\u201d Cuomo announced. \u201cFirst of all, we have for the first time ever a hospital-by-hospital survey that will be done on a nightly basis of exactly what they have.\u201d All hospitals are also being asked to contribute supplies they don\u2019t currently need to a central stockpile so the state can distribute supplies to hospitals with the greatest need. \u201cRather than having all these regional systems and public systems, private systems, et cetera, we have a central stockpile. We are asking all the hospitals to contribute what they have to that central stockpile, and then we will disburse on a need basis,\u201d Cuomo added. \u201cYou know, some hospitals have more supplies than they're using. We're saying, don't hoard supplies. Let's put all the supplies in the central stockpile, and then we will draw down from the central stockpile, and we will monitor this literally on a daily basis. ##Health## The Life Care Center nursing home home in Kirkland, Washington, which was an epicenter of Covid-19 cases in the early days of the pandemic, now faces a fine of more than $611,000 and loss of its Medicare and Medicaid funding if it does not correct a variety of problems that stem from its handling of the disease\u00a0outbreak\u00a0at its facility. Inspectors for the\u00a0Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0found three \"immediate jeopardy\" deficiencies as well as several other, less severe, issues when they first visited the facility from March 6 to March 16, a summary for that visit shows. \"The facility failed to have a system in place that ensured timely action related to an identified respiratory outbreak within the facility,\" the federal agency wrote in the report, explaining why Life Care didn't provide its residents an adequate level of care.\u00a0 \"There was no evidence the facility recognized all possible systemic risks and concerns related to this known outbreak,\" the report adds. Other serious issues identified by inspectors were a failure to \"ensure timely notification of public health authorities\" and to make available \"emergency physician services 24 hours a day during the outbreak crisis.\" Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has not yet signed off on a statewide stay-at-home order, but indicated in a Thursday press conference that this could change soon. Parson noted Missouri's social distancing requirements are set to expire shortly. \u201cWe said we would evaluate (the next step) at the end of that order.\u00a0That time is coming,\" he added. Parson said he plans to announce more information on Friday.\u00a0He said officials are trying to determine whether \u201cessential businesses\u201d could be classified differently in urban and rural parts of Missouri if there were a statewide order. The state\u2019s most populous counties already have put their own stay-at-home orders into effect covering more than two million Missourians.\u00a0 \u00a0 After issuing a stay-at-home executive order on Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed another executive order today that overrides any conflicting orders put in place by local governments.\u00a0 \"This order shall supersede any conflicting official action or order issued by local officials in response to COVID-19,\" the order states.\u00a0 It's an about-face for the governor.\u00a0Earlier in the Covid-19 crisis, when he was criticized for not closing the state\u2019s beaches, the governor said the move was because he wanted cities and counties to make their own decisions.\u00a0\u00a0 Desantis said at a Thursday news briefing that he did not believe the government had the authority to close church. \"I think that in times like this, I think the service that they're performing is going to be very important for people, especially when you have difficult circumstances and so do it right. Make sure that you're following the mission. But I think, particularly coming up in the Easter season, I think people are going to want to have access to religious services, whether it's online, whether it's in a more socially distant type of service. But to have that available I think is very important,\" Desantis said. Remember: Hillsborough County is one of the local governments affected by DeSantis' superseding order.\u00a0The county enacted its own order limiting\u00a0social gatherings to ten or fewer people.\u00a0The county sheriff arrested popular pastor Rodney Howard-Browne for continuing to hold large church services in violation of the order.\u00a0 But the state's new stay-at-home order includes \"attending religious services conducted in churches, synagogues and house of worship\" as essential activities.\u00a0\u00a0 The stay-at-home order starts Friday and will expire on April 30.\u00a0 The commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt who in a memo warned Navy leadership that more action was needed for the Covid-19 outbreak on the ship is expected to be relieved of duty for being suspected of leaking the memo, a defense official tells CNN Capt. Brett Crozier wrote in the memo,\u00a0\"We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2014 our Sailors,\" Capt. Brett Crozier wrote in a memo to the Navy's Pacific Fleet, three US defense officials have confirmed to CNN. The US Navy aircraft carrier where an\u00a0outbreak of the coronavirus\u00a0has spread to over 100 sailors in recent days. \"Decisive action is required. Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure,\" he wrote in the memo. \"This is a necessary risk. It will enable the carrier and air wing to get back underway as quickly as possible while ensuring the health and safety of our Sailors. Keeping over 4,000 young men and women on board the TR is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those Sailors entrusted to our care.\" The US Navy declined to comment. Reuters was first to report this story.\u00a0 Watch: There are at least\u00a0236,339\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and 5,648\u00a0people have died,  according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States. So far, on Thursday,\u00a019,617\u00a0new cases have been reported and\u00a0511\u00a0people have died, according to the tally by Johns Hopkins.\u00a0 The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases.  Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. Gov. Mike DeWine announced today that Ohio's stay-at-home order will be extended until May 1. All travelers entering the state are also required to quarantine for 14 days. \"We understand that this is tough - it is very difficult. But, I would not be making these decisions if it wasn't a mater of life and death,\" said DeWine in a press release. \"We have to keep this monster down. It's not dead - it's very much alive.\"\u00a0 ##Daily Life## \u00a0All K-12 schools in Indiana \u201cshall provide instruction via remote learning \u201c for remainder of the school year,\" according to an executive order signed by Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb, All school buildings shall remained closed.\u00a0More in the order\u00a0here \u00a0 At a media briefing Thursday, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker touted the state response to Covid-19 and encouraged the people of Illinois to stay home to help prevent the spread of the virus. Pritzker also lamented, what he called, a lack of early action from the federal government to address the pandemic. \u201cI'm honestly upset about the lack of early action on a national basis. This will go down in history as a profound failure of our national government,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cI'm telling you this because I want you to know that in terms of state action, state orders, we've nearly exhausted every avenue available. Now the rest is up to you.\u201d US stocks closed higher and snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday. Investors shrugged off the largest number of initial jobless claims in history. Gains were driven by energy stocks, which rallied on soaring oil prices after President Trump called for production cuts. Here's where the markets closed today: The Dow closed up 2.2%, or 470 points.\nThe S&P 500 finished 2.3% higher.\nThe Nasdaq Composite ended up 1.7%. Remember: As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. ##Business## Lowe\u2019s is implementing a temporary\u00a0$2\u00a0an hour pay increase for all of its workers. The home improvement chain said in its announcement Thursday that the wage increase is for April only. It applies to all of the company's full-time, part-time and seasonal hourly workers who are employed at Lowe's stores, its contact centers and its fulfillment facilities in the US and\u00a0Canada. Lowe\u2019s CEO Marvin Ellison said the move was a \u201cway to thank our 300,000 associates for their heroic actions in serving the needs of our communities.\u201d Masks and gloves will be available to all associates. Lowe's also noted that it has halted sales of N95 masks which are instead \"being donated\u00a0to hospitals to protect frontline healthcare workers.\" Also, Lowe's will now close all of its stores at 7 p.m. to allow time for cleaning and sanitizing. ##Business## Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has announced his state is now under a stay-at-home order.  The order will stay in effect until April 14. In just 18 days this year, Connecticut has surpassed the total number of unemployment claims made in all of of 2019, Gov. Ned Lamont announced today. Connecticut had 180,000 total unemployment claims last year. Over the last 18 days this year, the state has received 220,000 claims, Lamont said. \u201cThat\u2019s something like 20 times the scale and obviously we are struggling to keep up,\u201d Lamont added. Addressing the overall budget issues, Lamont said, \u201cWe are prepared for a lot in this state but nobody is prepared for the scale of what we have been confronted over the last few months and what we can expect for at least the next three months.\u201d President Trump\u00a0says he is invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) to clear up supply chain problems encountered in the manufacturing of medical ventilators.\u00a0 \u201cToday, I have issued an order under the Defense Production Act to more fully ensure that domestic manufacturers can produce ventilators needed to save American lives,\" Trump said in a statement. The statement also said this order will help domestic manufacturers \u201csecure the supplies they need to build ventilators needed to defeat the virus.\u201d The use of the\u00a0DPA will remove supply chain obstacles that threaten the production of ventilators, the statement added. \u201cToday\u2019s order will save lives by removing obstacles in the supply chain that threaten\u00a0the rapid production of ventilators,\u201d the statement said. The order directs Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to\u00a0\"use any and all authority available under the Act to facilitate the supply of materials to the appropriate subsidiary or affiliate of the following entities for the production of ventilators:\u00a0\u00a0General Electric Company; Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.; Medtronic Public Limited Company; ResMed Inc.; Royal Philips N.V.; and Vyaire Medical, Inc.\"\u00a0 There are at least 1,002,159\u00a0cases of coronavirus globally, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. The total includes confirmed cases from 180 countries and regions. So far, 51,485\u00a0people have died worldwide from the virus. California Gov. Gavin Newsom was stern when asked today about California churches remaining open during the pandemic. \u201cWith all due respect,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s essential that we practice physical distancing everywhere. Period. Full stop.\u201d Newsom asked those not practicing physical distancing to reconsider and indicated social pressure is the first step to adherence. As far as enforcement goes, the governor deferred to local authorities, but promised specific offenders would be addressed. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he will extend the state's executive order to stay at home until April 30. In the order, Edwards listed all businesses and services that should be closed; he did not mention anything about religious services. Some context: Earlier this week, the pastor of a Louisiana church was charged with misdemeanors for holding church services despite the order on gatherings from the government.\u00a0 Edwards did say that there should be no gatherings in groups of more than 10. Schools will remain closed through April 30 and new guidance will come from the Department of Education in the coming days on what the rest of the school year will look like, Edwards said. Connecticut has 267 new coronavirus cases and 27 new deaths, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday afternoon. The state now has a total of 3,824 confirmed cases and a total of 112 deaths. A total of 827 patients are currently hospitalized. Job loss in California is climbing rapidly and stands at 1.9 million unemployment claims, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news conference today. Over the past week, claims have been coming in at a rate of about 111,000 per day, Newsom said..\u00a0 Unemployment checks usually take about three weeks to turn around in California. Through reorganization, about 1,000 workers are being brought in to administer the claims surge. Providing more support: The governor outlined a few of new programs for small businesses and independent contractors. The first is a one year reprieve on sales tax payments, a bridge loan with no penalties or interest.\u00a0 Another program \u2013 the Paycheck Protection Program \u2013 starts Friday and will lend up to $10 million to small companies in order to pay their employees. Those loans will be eligible for a federal repayment grant, but at least 75% of the money must be used for payroll. Additionally, the governor said $50 million is being added to the state\u2019s infrastructure bank for micro loans \u2013 those would be payable to people not eligible for small business loans. Newsom also noted a partnership between Fresno company Bitwise and Silicon Valley giants LinkedIn and SalesForce. That group has created onwardca.org, a website that matches unemployed workers with open jobs. It is specifically focused on healthcare, agriculture, logistics and grocers. Michigan has 1,457 new coronavirus cases and 80 new deaths,\u00a0according to the state's website. There are now 10,791 total cases in the state. So far, 417 people have died from coronavirus in Michigan. Gov. Asa Hutchinson defended his decision not to issue a stay-at-home order for the state of Arkansas this afternoon during a press conference. Hutchinson said that the aggressive measures that he has taken \u2014 including closing schools, closing restaurants and bars (except for delivery or takeout), closing salons, barbershops, massage parlors, movie theaters, bowling alleys \u2014 have helped curb the spread of Covid-19 in the state.\u00a0 \"So the strategy of a targeted response to this emergency virus situation Arkansas is proven to be successful in bending the curve, lowering the apex of the curve and reducing the number of cases and hospitalizations in Arkansas,\" Hutchinson said. Hutchinson said if he was to issue a stay-at-home order, it would put a 100,000 people or more out of jobs. Arkansas has 624 confirmed coronavirus cases and 10 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. The United Kingdom is \u201clooking at\u201d the idea of an \u201cimmunity certificate\u201d \u2014 or passport \u2014 for people who have had coronavirus and have got the antibodies, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Thursday. People with the passports would be able to show them \u201cand get as much as possible back to normal life,\" he said. Asked if an immunity passport is a possible way out of the lockdown, Hancock said: \u201cThat is an important thing that we will be doing, that we are looking at.\u201d However, he cautioned: \u201cIt's too early in that science to be able to put clarity around that. I wish that we could but the reason that we can't is because the science isn't yet advanced enough.\u201d\u00a0 Hancock said the \"number one thing people can do to get out of this as fast as possible\" is to stay at home and follow social distancing measures. ##Daily Life## Pennsylvania is reporting 1,211 new cases today of novel coronavirus, according to Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine.

Exceptions can be made based on locations and work schedules, according to DeWine. Additional provisions in the new order include a dispute resolution panel, stores establishing new occupancy numbers to account for social distancing and stores creating lines for social distancing, DeWine said. The dispute resolution panel is for cases where similar businesses are being treated differently in different health districts. There are 113 health districts in the state, DeWine said. The state will not be regulating weddings or funerals and will be leaving \"it up to people's good judgment,\" DeWine said.\u00a0Receptions have to follow rules, not more than 10 people coming together. State parks will remain open \u2014 but they could be closed if people don't stick to social distancing guidelines, DeWine said. ##Daily Life## Lisa Ling and Andrew Yang are live now, discussing coronavirus and racism.

Virginia has 1,652 confirmed coronavirus cases and 35 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There are at least\u00a0226,374\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and 5,316\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. The total includes cases from all 50 states, Washington, DC, and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases. Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. The state of Louisiana has reported 2,726 new Covid-19 cases today and an additional 37 deaths.  There are 1,639 patients hospitalized and 507 patients on ventilators, according to the Department of Health. Orleans Parish, which includes New Orleans, still has the most cases in the state with 3,148 cases and 125 deaths. Jefferson Parish had 2,178 cases and 73 deaths. In a radio interview this morning, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said there would be a huge spike in numbers today due to more test results coming back. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said today that based on projections, they estimate the state could see between 47,000 to 172,00 cases of coronavirus during the course of the pandemic. Baker said that\u2019s approximately 0.7% to 2.5% of the total population of Massachusetts. The modeling also indicated that hospitalizations would potentially peak between April 10 and April 20, Baker said.  The governor added that the model is based on Wuhan and Massachusetts has factors that could improve the projections, for example, they have less population density, less smokers, and they implemented social distancing measures. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has issued a stay-at-home order for all 77 counties in the state until April 30, Stitt said in a series of tweets Wednesday night.\u00a0\u00a0 All non-essential businesses will remain closed during this time; that includes, gyms, barbers, tattoo and massage parlors, Stitt said.\u00a0 \"I don\u2019t make these decisions lightly but based on the data, we need to take action,\" Stitt said.\u00a0 Oklahoma has 3.943 million residents, according to the US Census Bureau.\u00a0 The state of New Jersey has 3,489 new positive cases of Covid-19, Gov.

To date, 25,590 people across the state have tested positive for Covid-19, Murphy said.\u00a0\u00a0 There are 537 people who have died from the coronavirus in New Jersey. That number includes 182 additional deaths confirmed in the last 24 hours, the governor announced.\u00a0\u00a0 Americans likely won't begin to see direct payments from the coronavirus stimulus bill until at least April 13 and it could take 20 weeks for all the checks to be mailed, Trump administration officials told lawmakers, according to a House Democratic memo obtained by CNN. The timeline means tens of millions of Americans will have to wait to get badly needed assistance, despite repeated suggestions from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the money would go out as soon as April 6.  Mnuchin said this past Sunday after passage of the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that payments would not go out until mid-April. Some context: CNN reported in March that former IRS officials said the wait would likely be weeks or months. Initially, the IRS will make about 60 million payments, likely in the week of April 13, for taxpayers who provided their direct deposit information through their 2018 or 2019 tax returns, the memo from the House Ways and Means Committee says. Three weeks later, on the week of May 4, the IRS expects to start issuing paper checks to individuals whose bank information isn't already on file, a process that will take much longer. According to the committee, the paper checks will be issued at a rate of about 5 million per week, and that it could take up to 20 weeks to issue all the checks. Individuals with the lowest income, based on adjusted gross income, will receive their checks first. The United Kingdom will test 100,000 people per day for coronavirus by the end of this month, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced Thursday.  \u201cThat is the goal and I am determined we will get there,\u201d Hancock said. The UK has not currently been able to reach its current target of 25,000 tests per day. Hancock set out the government\u2019s order of priority for testing people for coronavirus: Patients first, expanding to NHS staff and their families, critical key workers thirdly and \u201cover time we will expand to community.\" \u00a0 The global death toll from coronavirus climbed past 50,000 on Thursday. So far, at least 50,230 have now died from the virus worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the creation of a new bipartisan House select committee on the coronavirus crisis that will exercise oversight of the federal response to the pandemic and be chaired by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. The speaker told reporters Thursday on a conference call that the committee's immediate focus will be on \"the here and now,\" not the Trump administration's initial response to the pandemic, though she said there will come a time when such a review will be appropriate. She said the committee will \"have an expert staff and the committee will be empowered to examine all aspects of the federal response to coronavirus and to ensure that the taxpayers dollars are being wisely and efficiently spent to save lives, deliver relief, and benefit our economy.\" Pelosi said the committee will be able to exercise oversight and would have the authority to issue subpoenas. \"It's no use having a committee unless you have subpoena power,\" Pelosi said. \"We would hope there would be cooperation,\" she added. \"We want to make sure there are not exploiters out there.\" Chicago Police Officer Marco Di Franco, a 21-year veteran of the department, died after testing positive for Covid-19 last week, Interim Police Superintendent Charlie Beck said Thursday at a briefing with officials.\u00a0 He worked in the narcotics section and was \"held in high esteem\" by his commander, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.\u00a0 Di Franco, 50, was hospitalized over the weekend and died with \"family by his side,\" city officials said. He had been using a \"one person\" patrol vehicle and it is not clear how he contracted the virus, Beck said.\u00a0 Lightfoot \"implores the small segment\" who has not \"gotten the message\" to stay home and save lives to honor Di Franco's life and service. He is survived by his wife and two children, ages 7 and 10, as well as his brother who worked in the same department. His family is currently quarantined, city officials say.\u00a0 Some general practice physicians in England are setting up so-called \"hot sites\" for people who have symptoms of Covid-19, according to Laura Sharpe, the chief executive of City & Hackney GP Confederation, a membership body for the GP surgeries in the City of London and Hackney borough. The idea is to keep people with symptoms, who need to see a doctor, away from those without and therefore to minimize the spread of the virus. \u201cIf they [doctors] feel like someone needs a face-to-face examination, and they have suspected Covid-19 symptoms, then we need somewhere for those people to be brought to, if we can\u2019t visit them in their home,\u201d Sharpe told CNN on Thursday. The first site in the City of London and Hackney is due to open next week, and they are looking at opening additional sites in north and east Hackney.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve had an amazing response from GPs,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cThey have signed up in droves to do a session here and there across the rota of the first hub that will open next week.\u201d There have been 2,373 coronavirus-related deaths across the state of New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday during a press conference. This is up from 1,941 deaths reported on Wednesday.

Officials stressed that the next two weeks will be crucial in determining the shape of the pandemic curve in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced questions Thursday about why modeling data had not yet been released in Canada, as the Trump administration has done in the US. \"I know a lot of people are still wondering when this will get better, or how much worse it might become,\" said Trudeau during his daily press conference in Ottawa. Trudeau said that modeling information would be released soon but stressed his government is reviewing data to ensure more accurate modeling. \u201cHow do we make sure the analysis that we apply to the data that\u2019s coming in, that\u2019s being published daily so Canadians can see it, actually makes sense and reflects what\u2019s going to happen in various regions across the country,\u201d he said. The vast majority of Canadians are now under \"stay at home\" orders and most public schools have been closed for more than two weeks. ##Health## The Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee is moving to week of August 17, a source with knowledge told CNN. \u201cIn our current climate of uncertainty, we believe the smartest approach is to take additional time to monitor how this situation unfolds so we can best position our party for a safe and successful convention. During this critical time, when the scope and scale of the pandemic and its impact remain unknown, we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of health care professionals and emergency responders,\u201d said Joe Solmonese, CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee said in a statement. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is holding a news conference on coronavirus. His brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, just joined the briefing video conference. Chris Cuomo was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this week. \"This is very tough. I get it now,\" the news anchor told the governor. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state has enough ventilators to last about six days if the rate of people needing them stays stable. \"If that rate continues, in our stock pile we have about six days,\" Cuomo said. \"If the apex increases, if the apex is longer, we have an issue with ventilators.\" Cuomo said he's working on finding more ventilators, but he has \"no desire to acquire more\u00a0ventilators than we need \"If a person comes in and needs\u00a0a ventilator and you don't have\u00a0one, the person dies.\u00a0That's the blunt equation here,\" he said. Watch: A \u201cCovid only\u201d temporary hospital in Staten Island is expected to open next week, New York Gov. Cuomo said.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the apex for coronavirus cases in the state is anywhere \u201cfrom 7 to 21 to 30 days,\u201d according to all of the models. The variable depends on how a specific model rates how effective social distancing is, he said.\u00a0 \u201cThe models that\u00a0think social distancing is going\u00a0to be more effective at slowing\u00a0the rate have a longer timeframe for the apex,\u201d Cuomo said. Cuomo said state experts believe that \u201cit is closer to the shorter end of the range\u201d but admits the window \u201cmakes it difficult to plan, frankly.\u201d Cuomo said that all of the models show that New York would come down from the apex quickly, but about 16,000 New Yorkers could die from coronavirus, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model cited by Dr. Anthony Fauci and the White House. Watch Here: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said there are at least 92,381 cases of coronavirus in the state. He said there has been 8,669 of them are new cases.

USNS Comfort docked New York City is treating \u201cabout three\u201d patients according to Capt. Patrick Amersbach, the Comfort\u2019s commanding officer. Remember: The ships are not treating coronavirus patients. Instead, they are being used for relocating shore-based patients undergoing treatments that are not coronavirus-related. Each ship contains 12 fully equipped operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, radiology services, a medical lab, pharmacy, optometry lab, a CAT-scan and two oxygen producing plants,\u00a0according to the Navy. ##Health## The US Food and Drug Administration wants to remind the public that there is no evidence of the coronavirus pandemic posing a threat to food safety. \"The food supply remains safe for both people and animals. There is no \u2014 and I emphasize no \u2014 evidence of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of Covid-19,\" Frank Yiannas, FDA deputy commissioner for food policy and response, said during a call with reporters today. Yiannas said it's \"much more likely that an infected person will spread the virus through person-to-person transmission than from contaminated food or food packaging.\" He added that if a person who works in a food facility tests positive for Covid-19, the FDA does not anticipate that there would need to be a massive recall or withdrawal of food products from the market.\u00a0 \"Specifically for consumers, we advise you that you follow many of the same guidelines that you heard before the spread of the disease,\" Yiannas said.\u00a0 \u00a0He urged people who go grocery shopping to \"adhere to good hygiene practices such as disinfecting grocery cart handles with the wipes often provided by retailers.\" \"Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose or mouth. After shopping, wash or sanitize your hands,\" he said. When asked if consumers should wipe down food packaging when they bring it home,\u00a0Yiannas said, \u201cAgain, we don\u2019t believe that food packaging is a common route of transmission.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI personally do not sanitize the exterior of food packages when I bring them into my home,\u201d Yiannas added, \u201cIf you feel so inclined you can always wipe the surface of the packages when you get home with a disinfectant wipe and then air drying them.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0##Daily Life## ##Health## An ice rink in the British town of Milton Keynes will be converted into a makeshift mortuary.

There are places where the coronavirus already poses a serious threat to its residents, like in Moscow, where, despite the regional and federal efforts, we so far have not succeeded in turning the tide,\u201d Putin said.\u00a0 So far, the country has not proclaimed the state of emergency or called a nationwide quarantine, instead imposing \"a paid holiday\" week, which was due to end on Friday. However, the majority of regions independently have imposed self-isolation regimes and ramped up measures to urge Russians to stay home. ##Daily Life## Conditional approval has been reached to allow the Zaandam and Rotterdam ships to dock in Port Everglades in Florida.

He said his letter was sent in response to a query from Kelvin\u00a0Droegemeier\u00a0with the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This letter responds to your question concerning the possibility that [coronavirus] could be spread by conversation, in addition to sneeze/cough-induced droplets,\" the letter states. \"Currently available research supports the possibility that [coronavirus] could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients' exhalation,\" it continues.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus spreads from person to person when people are within about six feet of each other. It spreads \"through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Fineberg\u00a0told CNN this is true \u2014 but that research shows that aerosolized droplets produced by talking or possibly even by just breathing can also spread the virus.\u00a0\u00a0 Fineberg\u00a0said it's possible that aerosolized coronavirus droplets can hang in the air and potentially infect someone who walks by later. How long coronavirus lingers in the air depends on several factors, including how much virus an infected individual puts out when breathing or talking, and also on the amount of circulation in the air, he said.\u00a0 He added, however, that coronavirus is not as infectious as measles or tuberculosis. \u00a0##Health## Germany will need \u201cbillions of masks\u201d to fight its coronavirus outbreak, the Bavarian state premier Markus Soder said Thursday. \u201cIn the long run, we will need enormous amounts of masks,\u201d Soder said. \u201cI believe that in the end we will need billions of masks in Germany.\u201d He said the masks would initially be needed by medical staff and then the elderly people in nursing homes. Germany\u2019s Health Minister Jens Spahn wants the country to become less dependent on masks made elsewhere, advocating that Germany should make more. \u201cWe must become more independent of the world market, for the security of our citizens. That is one of the lessons of these weeks.

The number of coronavirus cases in Germany is continuing to rise rapidly. The worse-affected region is Bavaria, which has more than 18,000 confirmed cases and 268 deaths, according to data from the Robert Koch\u00a0Institute.

Another 124 coronavirus-related deaths were reported in\u00a0Iran\u00a0on Thursday, bringing the total death toll to 3,160, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpoor said on state TV. The overall number of cases in\u00a0the country meanwhile\u00a0reached 50,468, with an extra 2,875 reported over the past 24 hours, Jahanpoor said.\u00a0 A total of 16,711 patients have recovered and been released from hospitals across the country, while 3,965 hospitalized patients remain in critical condition, he added. Iran has been the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, trailing only China, the United States and four European nations in Johns Hopkins University's tally of total confirmed cases. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta apologized Wednesday for violence and harsh tactics used by police last week to enforce a nationwide coronavirus curfew.\u00a0\u00a0 Police have been accused of using batons and tear gas to disperse crowds\u00a0in the city of Mombasa\u00a0to enforce the curfew.\u00a0 \"I know especially when we introduced the curfew, maybe in the initial stages, there were some challenges,\" Kenyatta said in a televised speech. \"And I want to apologize to all Kenyans maybe for some excesses that were conducted or happened,\" he said. \"But I want to assure you, that if we work together, if we all understand that this problem needs all of us, and if we all pull in the same direction, we will overcome.\"\u00a0 According to the latest figures by Johns Hopkins University, there have been 81 confirmed coronavirus cases in Kenya and one death. The Ritsona refugee camp in Greece has been placed into two weeks of quarantine after some of its residents tested positive to coronavirus, the country\u2019s Migration Ministry says. The camp, north-east of Athens, is home to more than 2,000 refugees. According to the ministry, 63 people in the camp have been tested. Twenty of those have confirmed cases of coronavirus. The testing was carried out when a woman at the camp was confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, after she gave birth in an Athens hospital on Sunday. It\u2019s unclear how she became infected. Under the new quarantine rules, no one will be allowed in or out of the camp for the next two weeks. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing a public backlash after he said the government would distribute two reusable cloth face masks per household amid growing concern over medical shortages, as the country faces a worsening\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0outbreak. The number of confirmed cases of the virus has spiked in recent weeks, after it appeared that Japan's initial response had got the virus relatively under control. As of Wednesday, there were more than 2,300 cases across Japan, and 57 deaths, according to a\u00a0Johns Hopkins University tally. That spike has seen a raft of new restrictions put in place in Tokyo and other major cities, and a run on protective gear, including face masks. On Wednesday, Abe said the provision of cloth masks to the worst-hit areas \"will be helpful in responding to the rapidly increasing demand.\" But Abe's proposal to send two masks to each household attracted outrage and mockery online Wednesday, with the hashtag \"Abe's mask\" and \"screw your two masks\" trending on Twitter. Many felt the move was lackluster and would not go into effect fast enough to have a chance at curbing the spread of the virus, with masks not due to be distributed until the end of the month. Others dubbed the policy \"Abenomask policy\" as satirical memes showing well-known cartoon characters sharing one mask between four family members popped up online. The anger comes as Abe resisted calls Wednesday to declare a state of emergency, saying that use of such powers was not imminent. Read more here. An Indian court has directed police to return the mobile phone and SIM card they seized from a doctor who criticized the government online for \u201callegedly deficient protective gear supplied by the government to its doctors.\u201d\u00a0 According to the order\u00a0issued on April 1 by the Calcutta High Court,\u00a0Indranil Khan, a private practitioner, wrote several posts on Facebook\u00a0on the issue. He was interrogated by police on March 29, and was booked under\u00a0Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code, which relates to \u201cpromoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language ... and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cFreedom of speech and expression which is granted under Article 19 of the Constitution of India has to be scrupulously upheld by the State,\" the order read.  \"If an expression of opinion brings the government into disrepute, it cannot defend this allegation by intimidation of the person expressing the opinion by subjecting him to prolonged interrogation, threatening arrest seizing his mobile phone and SIM card and so on.\" The order also observed that a tweet posted by Khan had received a reply from the Department of Health and Family Welfare thanking him for highlighting the issue. Along with directions to return his mobile phone, the order also states that Khan cannot be further interrogated without court approval. For the time being, he has been told to refrain from sharing posts on the matter. Spain passed another grim milestone in its coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, reporting that more than 10,000 have now died in the country as a result of the virus. The Health Ministry said it recorded 950 new deaths in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day increase the country has seen so far. Its total death tally is now 10,003. But there was some cause for cautious optimism in the country, whose devastating outbreak appears to be slowing.  The 10.5% rise reported Thursday is similar to Wednesday\u2019s increase, and smaller in percentage terms than any recorded in the past two weeks.\u00a0 It comes after the country's Health Minister said the curve of new cases in Spain has come under control, and that the drastic emergency measures put in place to lock down the country are working. \u201cThe data shows us that the curve has stabilized,\" Salvador Illa said in the government's Thursday press conference. \"That we have achieved the primary objective of reaching the peak of the curve and that now we are starting the phase of deceleration.\" Spain\u2019s government has come under criticism from opposition parties, some health workers and unions for reported shortages of ICU facilities, lack of sufficient personal protective gear and overstretched health workers. Illa warned that the country's health service remains under strain, saying: \"Even observing a decrease in the number of admissions, the long stays in these units produce an effect of accumulation of patients because of which there still remains difficult weeks for our health system.\" But officials have indicated that Spain's harsh lockdown measures are having the desired effect. Health official Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra said on Wednesday that the lower case numbers help \u201cevaluate the measures we\u2019ve been taking very positively,\" and that in many communities around the country the government has seen pressure on intensive care units ease. Spain has been one of the world's worst-hit countries, trailing only Italy in total deaths from Covid-19, and behind Italy and the United States in total reported cases. Meanwhile, Spaniards continue to grapple with the devastating economic impact of the pandemic. The nation registered an increase in unemployment of 302,265 people in March compared to the previous month, according to Spanish Labor Ministry data released Thursday. This increase represents the largest monthly rise since records began, Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz said at a press conference in Madrid on Thursday. She called the increase in unemployment \u201cabsolutely exceptional\u201d and \u201chistoric.\u201d The Philippine Ambassador to Lebanon, Bernardita Catalla, has died from complications of Covid-19, the embassy said in a statement on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0 Catalla, a career diplomat for 27 years, died in hospital in Beirut. Months before her death, she spearheaded\u00a0the\u00a0evacuation of nearly 2,000 Filipinos, mostly female domestic workers, from crisis-ridden Lebanon.\u00a0\u00a0 Lebanon has been in the throes of a financial and political crisis\u00a0since October 2019, and many African and Asian migrant workers in the country reported a large drop in earnings and the withholding of salaries. The Philippine embassy\u2019s evacuation program for Filipinos, many of whom were undocumented, received praise from humanitarian workers and international rights groups.\u00a0\u00a0 CNN interviewed Catalla twice about her repatriation program since December. \u201cThose who feel that they have to go back to the Philippines do so because they have nothing here anymore. Some have become homeless,\u201d Catalla told CNN in February.\u00a0 Women clamored for selfies with the ambassador as they waited for the bus to take them to the airport. Asked what she thought about the praise being heaped on the embassy for their evacuation program, Catalla responded: \u201cWe\u2019re just doing our jobs.\u201d\u00a0 Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodro Locsin Jr tweeted that before Catalla died he \u201cextended her a great job in a difficult post. I promised her Paris so she\u2019d hang on.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut she just laughed, \u2018Now I must learn French,\u2019\u201d wrote Locsin.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAmbassador Bernie Catalla\u2019s remains will be received with an honor guard and I am putting forward a nomination for Gawad Mabini and Sikatuna,\u201d said Locsin, referring to an honor conferred on Filipinos for distinguished foreign service.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot that she needs more honor than the profound regret and mourning of a grateful service, government, and I hope nation.\u201d\u00a0 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will enter self-quarantine for seven days, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office, after the country's Health Minister tested positive for coronavirus. It is the second time Netanyahu has entered self-quarantine. The 70-year-old Israeli leader self-isolated for a short period after one of his aides tested positive for coronavirus late last month. Netanyahu has twice tested negative for the disease. Health Minister Yaakov Litzman is in good condition, according to a statement from the Health Ministry. The 71-year old and his wife, who also tested positive, will remain at home, where the Health Minister will continue to carry out his job, the statement said.\u00a0 Senior members of the Ministry of Health and aides to Litzman will also self-isolate because of their close contact with the minister. That includes Health Ministry Director-General Moshe Bar Siman Tov, who has frequently held evening briefings with Netanyahu to answer questions and inform the public of new restrictions.\u00a0 Among others being considered for possible self-isolation by health officials, according to multiple reports on Israeli media, is Yossi Cohen, the head of the Mossad intelligence service. As of Thursday morning, Israel had 6,211 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 32 deaths as a result of the disease. There are now 4 million French employees on partial unemployment support and the number is still \u201cstrongly increasing,\u201d France\u2019s Labor Minister Muriel P\u00e9nicaud said Thursday. Under the scheme, firms can reduce their activity while asking the state for compensation to be redistributed to employees. Employees on the minimum wage or in a part-time job will receive 100% of their usual salary, the minister said. Other employees will receive 84% of their salary, P\u00e9nicaud added. The partial unemployment system should enable the country to recover as quickly as possible after the crisis, as it maintains the link between employers and employees, French PM Edouard Philippe explained on Wednesday. ##Daily Life## India\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology has issued a manual of instructions on how to make homemade masks in a bid to counter shortages or for those who lack access. \u201cThis is primarily meant for the people who want to wear masks but do not have access to them. They can make these washable and reusable masks at home\u201d said Dr. Shailja Vaidya Gupta, senior adviser at the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government in a\u00a0news release.\u00a0 Although the government has not issued a directive making it compulsory to wear masks, an increasing number of shops catering towards essential needs are demanding that customers wear a mask while on the premises. Sewing masks with a machine or by hand: The\u00a0manual\u00a0has been put together keeping in mind easy access to materials with instructions that are simple to follow. It has instructions for making masks with either a sewing machine or by hand, and instructions on how to wear and take care of them.\u00a0 Masks divide opinion: Opinion has been split on whether wearing a mask is an effective solution to curbing the spread of coronavirus. While it\u2019s been common practice in parts of Asia, in other regions of the world, public health authorities and politicians have urged people to focus on washing their hands and maintaining social distancing. ##Daily Life## The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in\u00a0Austria\u00a0has passed 10,000, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. A total of 10,769 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the country, and the death toll now stands at 146. Wearing face masks to become compulsory: Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced earlier this week that wearing face masks in shops would become compulsory. The health ministry says this measure will take effect from April 6. Shops and drugstores in Austria will be required to provide customers with a mask if they are not already wearing their own. The order puts Austria, along with the Czech Republic and Slovakia, at odds with some international medical authorities. WHO and US CDC experts have long argued that people who are not sick nor caring for someone who is sick should leave masks in the medical supply chain for health care workers who need them most. But some experts who have made the argument for people to wear masks have pointed to past research showing the effectiveness of masks against the spread of influenza and to early research on Covid-19. The top US general in South Korea says that he does not believe North Korea\u2019s claim it has no cases of novel coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cThat is an impossible claim based on all of the intel we have seen,\u201d Gen. Robert Abrams, Commander of US Forces Korea (USFK), said in a joint interview with CNN and Voice of America. \u201cHow many? I couldn\u2019t tell you but I do know by their actions that for about 30 days in February, early March, that their military was locked down and they took draconian methods on their border crossings and in their formations.\u201d North Korea has not reported any coronavirus infections, but it borders two of the most heavily affected countries in the region -- China and South Korea. While the 16th USFK-related coronavirus infection was reported today, Abrams said the military force has managed to keep that number low. \u201cWe've seen the worst but now is not the time to get complacent. Our worst is frankly not that bad,\" Abrams said. He added that the 16 USFK-related cases were reported out of 58,000 people in total, including\u00a028,500 active military personnel, dependents and support staff for bases around the country. As USFK was among the first US military forces to have to deal with the virus worldwide, Abrams said he has advice for those now grappling with the spread around the world.\u00a0 \u201cGo hard, go early, it will seem like over-reaction, it will seem a bit over-the-top, 'My gosh why are we having to do that draconian measure?' A week later your community will understand (and) your unit will understand why you had to do that,\" he said. Any sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier who test negative for the novel coronavirus will soon disembark the ship and begin their 14-day quarantine in Guam. So far, 93 sailors from the US Navy ship have tested positive for the virus, 86 of whom are symptomatic. None have required hospitalization so far. In total, there are more than 4,000 crew members on board the ship, only 1,273 of whom have already been tested. \u201cOver the next 12 to 24 hours, we plan to move the first group of Covid-19 negative asymptomatic sailors to approved commercial lodging for quarantine in accordance with the governor\u2019s executive order and CDC guideline,\" Joint Region Marianas Commander Adm. John Menoni\u00a0said at a news conference in Guam today.\u00a0 \"Sailors will only be permitted to depart the base following a negative Covid-19 test result.\u00a0They must remain in quarantine, in their assigned rooms for the duration of the mandatory 14-day quarantine.\"  Guam Governor Lou Leon Guerrero defended her decision to allow the sailors to disembark from the aircraft carrier and to come onshore.\u00a0\"The bottom line is our sailors go out and protect our freedom. We ask them to go out and sacrifice their lives for our protections, and they are asking us to help them get over this god-awful virus, and when I look at the opportunities and possibilities and space, I decided to say yes,\" she said. Iranian Foreign Minister\u00a0Javad Zarif slammed President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic today, saying he was using the crisis for political gain.\u00a0 \"We have not witnessed throughout history such heinous employment of a humanitarian catastrophe for revenge and to spread hatred and electoral exploitation as the current American president and his team do,\" Zarif said in a quote from state news agency IRNA.\u00a0\n\u201cIn order for the world efforts to yield fruit and in order for the world to return to (normal) life, we have to believe that all the planet Earth is a battlefield and in wherever part of the world we are defeated, the entire world will be defeated.\" Zarif also said on Thursday on his official Twitter account that \"Iran starts no wars, but teaches lessons to those who do,\" adding that Iran has \"friends\" rather than \"proxies.\"\u00a0 Echoing Zarif's comments, an\u00a0adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday that the US sanctions are contributing to the spread of the virus and urged Americans to join the global fight.\u00a0 \"Trump\u2019s economic sanctions equal further spread of the virus in Iran which equals further spread of the virus in the US! Help us help you,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Hesameddin Ashena,\u00a0head of the Center for Strategic Studies of the President's Office, as quoted by IRNA.\u00a0\n\"Dear Americans: If we don't fight the coronavirus globally it will reappear globally, again and again and again.\" Iran has recorded\u00a047,593 coronavirus cases and 3,036 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. In many ways it was just like any other wedding. On the day of the ceremony, the groom's parents got themselves prepared early in the morning, dressing in their best wedding clothes. When they were ready for the service to begin, they walked into the living room and joined other family members to watch on a two-way video stream as their son got married in Phoenix, Arizona -- almost 8,000 miles away. Several members of groom Nitin Mehta's family were due to fly over from New Delhi to see him marry fiancee Miranda Jenkins in Phoenix.  But the night before they left, Prime Minister Narendra Modi locked down the country to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. The trip had been planned for a year at least but now, unable to leave, they had to find another way to take part. \"My parents, my wife and kids (and I) woke up at about 4 a.m., put on our wedding clothes and joined the wedding virtually on a video call ... They could see us watching and talk to us,\" the groom's brother Nalin Mehta told CNN. They weren't the only guests to miss the wedding. About 150 people were scheduled to attend the ceremony, but fears of the coronavirus and lockdowns worldwide meant it ended up being limited to about 20 close friends and family. \"(The groom) Nitin himself was actually in the air on a flight from London to Phoenix for his wedding when (President Donald) Trump announced that no flights from the UK would be allowed to land in the USA. So he barely made it back himself for his own wedding,\" the groom's brother said. It might seem distant, but Mehta said it had made them all feel like they were together on the special day -- he even gave his best man's speech over WhatsApp. \"This allowed us all as a family to feel part of an intimate family event ... at this time of great disruption of the way we live,\" he said. ##Daily Life## Editor's note: Joe Lockhart was White House press secretary from 1998-2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\u00a0 President Donald Trump has received considerable criticism from many quarters -- governors, public health officials and doctors and nurses on the front line -- for being unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, and for not having a national plan to deal with it. Much of that criticism is well deserved. What is clear looking over the past two months is that the President and his team have had a sophisticated political strategy to deal with the fast spreading pandemic. That strategy began in January, where at every turn the President\u00a0downplayed the risks of the virus spreading in the United States. In interview after interview, and speech after speech, he assured Americans we were OK and any risk to the country was contained. President Trump pointed to the shutting down of some flights from China, and one of his aides\u00a0recently inaccurately said that Trump was the first to do it.\u00a0North Korea closed its borders on\u00a0January 22,\u00a0and Italy banned flights from China to Italy staring\u00a0January 31. The President's strategy was that if the US could avoid the pandemic, despite all the loud calls for more action, he would be seen as the wise leader who didn't overreact and didn't kill our economy. In an ironic twist, he co-opted former President Barack Obama's mantra of hope as a strategy. But I believe Trump had a fallback plan in case the deadly virus hit us hard and he had a political plan ready to deploy.

The organisation\u2019s medical director Paul\u00a0Cosford told Sky News that the UK is testing nearly 15,000 people a day and aims to reach 25,000 a day by the middle of April. In contrast, Germany leading virologist Christian Drosten says his country is testing 500,000 a week. \u201cI absolutely accept that we need to build this further,\u201d\u00a0Professor Cosford said. \u201cThere is a lot of work that is going on in order to get this testing capacity in place.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re in constant discussions with colleagues in Germany -- and other countries -- around what they\u2019re doing, where their sources are coming from, what their supply system is.\n\u201cOf course we need to build this further.\u201d He says only \u201cabout 2,000\u201d frontline National Health Service workers have so far been tested for the virus. ##Health## Infections near 1 million: More than 937,700 cases of the coronavirus have been reported worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally, with over 47,000 deaths. The US is the worst hit country, with more than 216,700 cases and over 5,100 deaths.  Death for quarantine breakers: Outspoken Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has warned that people who break quarantine and are \"unruly\" could be shot by law enforcement officers. During the address, Duterte said, \u201cMy orders to the police, the military and the barangays: If they become unruly and they fight you and your lives are endangered, shoot them dead!\u201d Fines for illegal PPE exporters: The Australian government will punish people convicted of illegally exporting masks, hand sanitizer or other personal protective equipment with hefty fines, officials said this week. It's part of an attempt to keep medical supplies inside the country.  Market forces at work: Only a portion of the medical supplies being flown into the US by the Federal Emergency Management Agency from overseas are being allotted to critical hot spots -- the rest are going onto the private market, multiple officials told CNN.  Pollution falls under lockdown: Data shows that India's main cities are recording much lower levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5, and of nitrogen dioxide, which is released by vehicles and power plants. Older patients with a low chance of survival could have life-saving ventilators removed so the machines can be given to healthier patients under new ethics guidelines issued by the British Medical Association (BMA). The guidance has been prepared for doctors who will need to make \"grave decisions\" about who should receive \"scarce lifesaving resources\" if the country\u2019s health system is overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. \"As such, some of the most unwell patients may be denied access to treatment such as intensive care or artificial ventilation,\" the BMA\u2019s ethics guidance note states.\n\"This will inevitably be indirectly discriminatory against both the elderly and those with long-term health conditions, with the latter being denied access to life-saving treatment as a result of their pre-existing health problems.\" Older patients given lower priority: The guidance says imposing an age cut-off would be illegal, but adds that older patients with pre-existing respiratory problems would have a \"very high chance of dying despite intensive care,\" and are therefore lower priority for admission. The guidance states: \"In dangerous pandemics the ethical balance of all doctors and health care workers must shift towards the utilitarian objective of equitable concern for all \u2013 while maintaining respect for all as 'ends in themselves.'\" The ethics guidance note was updated on April 1. The UK government has previously warned the country\u2019s health system could be overwhelmed if strict social distancing measures are not followed. ##Health## A 56-year-old man who died due to coronavirus-related illness is the first person to die from the disease in Asia's largest slum, Dharavi, in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai. The patient, who had no travel history, tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday and died the same evening while being transferred to a local hospital, Kiran Dighavkar, an official with Mumbai's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) told CNN.\u00a0 \"People who had been in contact with him and are perceived to be \"high risk\" have been asked to (be) home quarantined,\" Dighavkar said, adding the swabs of his family members and neighbors have been collected and sent for testing.\u00a0 The BMC will be providing food to the residents of the densely-populated Dharavi slum as they are not allowed to leave the area until all the test results come back, Dighavkar said. The BMC has been routinely carrying out disinfection drives in Mumbai's slums and public areas, according to the official. This is the second coronavirus-related death overall reported in Mumbai's slums since the outbreak began, BMC officials confirmed with CNN. Why it's a big deal: Home to around 1 million people, Dharavi slum has a population density almost 30 times greater than New York -- about 280,000 people per square kilometer. Doctors say the situation would be unmanageable if a sustained coronavirus outbreak spread rapidly through one of India's many slums, where there is little sanitation or running water and thousands of people live cheek by jowl -- making social distancing physically and economically impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge concern. They are packed together,\u201d said Dr. Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director of the Medanta-the Medicity hospital in Gurugram, near New Delhi.\u00a0 Trehan said it was vital that health authorities know if a slum has an outbreak.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t know the hot spots, and we don\u2019t know where these pockets are, the whole country is so huge, and there are so many people, it will not be possible to take care of them,\u201d he said.\u00a0 ##Health## The Australian government will punish people convicted of illegally exporting masks, hand sanitizer or other personal protective equipment with hefty fines, officials said. Home Minister Peter Dutton's office said in a statement yesterday that the fines were one of several new measures being adopted by the government to keep dwindling medical supplies inside the country. More than 5,000 people in Australia, including Dutton himself, have contracted the virus.  Authorities have amended customs regulations to \"stop exploitative exports of essential goods,\" and the country's Biosecurity Act to require the Australian Border Force to surrender medical supplies in their custody to the national stockpile. Violating the customs law is punishable by a fine of up to 210,000 Australian dollars ($128,275), while those found guilty of violating the Biosecurity Act could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 63,000 Australian dollars, Dutton's office said ($38,480). \"These measures have become necessary because we have seen a small number of individuals engaging in the bulk purchasing of essential goods from retail outlets in Australia, with the intent of profiteering from exploitative exporting and price gouging,\" the statement read. Like many countries around the world, Australia is currently dealing with a shortage of equipment needed to protect medical workers treating patients who have contracted the novel coronavirus. \"We've taken the steps to protect Australia's interest, to stop unauthorized, inappropriate exporting of those things that we rely upon for our health care and so on at present,\" trade minister Simon Birmingham said in an interview with Australia's ABC News yesterday. Other countries like the United States and South Korea have enacted similar measures or are considering them. ##Business## Panama is taking a new -- if somewhat unorthodox -- measure to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus: separation of the sexes. Starting on Wednesday, only women will be able to leave their homes to buy necessities on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Men in Panama will be allowed to venture outside to run errands on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Everyone will have to stay home on Sundays. The restrictions will last for at least 15 days,\u00a0according to government officials. Why are they separating men and women? The additional measures to the already-announced national quarantine in theory will make it easier for police in the Central American nation to limit the number of people going out in public. \"The great quantity of people circulating outside their homes, despite the obligatory national quarantine, has led the national government to take more severe measures,\" said a statement by\u00a0Panamanian President Laurentino \"Nito\" Cortizo on Twitter. Earlier, Panamanian officials had ordered all citizens to stay inside except for emergencies and to buy food. But alarmed by the number of people still going out, officials decided to divide the week by sex to further limit how much of the public is outside their homes at one time.

During a televised address on Wednesday, CNN Philippines reported\u00a0the Philippine leader urged people to cooperate with quarantine measures. But Duterte emphasized he would not tolerate those who threaten the lives of people working in law enforcement. During the address, Duterte said, \u201cMy orders to the police, the military and the barangays: If they become unruly and they fight you and your lives are endangered, shoot them dead!\u201d Hours before Duterte made the address, there were protests about government food aid in the capital city, Manila, CNN Philippines reported. ##Daily Life## As the number of coronavirus cases aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier approaches 100, some sailors will be quarantined in hotel rooms in Guam. The ship's commanding officer has issued a stark warning\u00a0to top Navy leadership about the need to get sailors off the ship as soon as possible. Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly said Wednesday that 93 sailors from the ship have tested positive for the virus to date, representing more than 10% of all cases across the entire US military. Cases expected to rise: A senior Defense official told CNN that the Navy expected the number of cases to rise as more test results come in. Modly said 1,273 of the ship's roughly 4,800 crew members have been tested for the virus so far and the Navy was still awaiting the results of some of those tests. He said about 1,000 sailors have been evacuated form the ship and moved ashore to Guam where the ship is currently in port. \"We already have nearly 1,000 personnel off the ship right now.

The 29-year-old midwife doesn't have a surgical mask to cover her face -- instead, she wears a cloth mask that provides insufficient protection from the virus, which has killed more than 47,000 people worldwide, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. \"I'm ready but not well-equipped (but) it's my duty to help in this time of pandemic,\" Abrias said. At least\u00a017\u00a0frontline coronavirus medics have already died in the Philippines, and more than 600 have been in quarantine, according to\u00a0CNN Philippines. As Abrias makes her daily calls, there is little to stop her from spreading the virus. One of her patients lives in a fruit and vegetable market, which as an essential service isn't subject to the same lockdown rules that have silenced busy streets across the island of Luzon since March 17. Abrias said the patient had a fever and body aches, so she told him to self-quarantine in his shop and avoid interacting with others. He hasn't been tested for the coronavirus, she said, because there are no testing kits. Abrias has to assume that he has the infectious disease, and that's what makes it so scary.

But grinding this country of 1.3 billion people to a near halt has also provided a temporary remedy to another pressing health issue: suffocating pollution levels. The\u00a0world's largest lockdown\u00a0means all factories, markets, shops, and places of worship are now closed, most public transport suspended and construction work halted, as India asks its citizens to stay home and practice social distancing.  India has recorded more than 1,998 cases of Covid-19, including 58 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Already, data shows that the main cities are recording much lower levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5, and of nitrogen dioxide, which is released by vehicles and power plants. \"I have not seen such blue skies in Delhi for the past 10 years,\" said Jyoti Pande Lavakare, the co-founder of Indian environmental organization Care for Air, and author of upcoming book \"Breathing Here is Injurious To Your Health.\"\n\"It is a silver lining in terms of this awful crisis that we can step outside and breathe.\" Read the full story here: ##Business## ##Daily Life## In the coming weeks, if they have not already, your government is likely to begin advising you to wear a face mask to protect against\u00a0coronavirus. For those living in Asia, such announcements will be a vindication of a tactic that has been\u00a0adopted across much of the region\u00a0since the beginning of the crisis and\u00a0appears to have been borne out\u00a0by lower rates of infection and faster containment of outbreaks. In other parts of the world, this message may be confusing, coming after weeks of public health authorities, politicians and media figures confidently claiming masks do not help and urging people instead to focus on washing their hands and maintaining social distancing. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\u00a0appeared before lawmakers in late February. Asked if people should wear masks, he had a straightforward answer: \"No.\" Now he's not so sure. On Monday,\u00a0Redfield told NPR that the CDC was reviewing its guidelines and\u00a0may recommend general mask use\u00a0to guard against community infection. It's likely only a matter of time before other mask holdouts, most prominently the World Health Organization, follow suit. Writing last month, Adrien Burch, an expert in microbiology at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that \"despite hearing that face masks 'don't work,' you probably haven't seen any strong evidence to support that claim. That's because it doesn't exist.\" In fact, there is evidence of the exact opposite: that masks help\u00a0prevent\u00a0viral infections like the current pandemic. Many countries and territories across Asia have been wearing masks for the entire length of the pandemic, and this strategy has been borne out by lower infection rates and more easily contained outbreaks. Now the rest of the world is finally coming around to this strategy.

The worker says he was reprimanded for wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) on March 18. According to a letter obtained from a spokesperson for Service Employees International Union Local 888, of which the worker is a member, the employee donned the equipment \u201cwithout permission or need.\u201d CNN is not naming the employee nor the individual who sent it, but it is on letterhead from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services Soldiers\u2019 Home in Holyoke.\u00a0 The news comes after the governor of Massachusetts hired an attorney to investigate the\u00a0deaths of 13 veterans\u00a0at the Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home. The worker -- a caregiver -- says he first came into contact with a veteran with symptoms consistent with Covid-19, who was not isolated, but rather walking around and coughing. It is unclear whether the PPE was personal or belonged to the facility. ##Health## More than 5,000 people have died from the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. It is a grim milestone for America, which has seen a rapid rise in coronavirus cases and fatalities in recent weeks.

Going forward, CNN will be reporting the Johns Hopkins University statistics on the coronavirus. ##Health## New Orleans jazz legend, educator and father of four musical sons, Ellis Marsalis Jr., died on Wednesday, Ellis Marsalis Center for Music director emeritus Quint Davis told CNN. The cause of death was\u00a0complications of Covid-19, his son Branford\u00a0Marsalis told the New York Times.\u00a0 \"Ellis Marsalis was a legend. He was the prototype of what we mean when we talk about New Orleans jazz,\u201d New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a statement Wednesday night. \n\u201cHe was a teacher, a father, and an icon \u2014 and words aren\u2019t sufficient to describe the art, the joy and the wonder he showed the world.\u201d\u00a0 A musical dynasty: Four of Marsalis\u2019 six sons followed in his musical footsteps, and established their own lasting careers in the industry. Ellis\u2019 son Wynton is\u00a0managing and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, and winner of multiple awards.  His son Branford is a jazz saxophonist who has recorded albums with Sting, among others. \u201cA huge loss,\u201d Davis told CNN. ##Health## The FBI reported a 41% surge in background checks on individuals attempting to buy firearms in the United States in the past month, as the country faces a growing coronavirus epidemic. According to newly\u00a0released data\u00a0from the FBI, 3.7 million gun purchase background checks were made in the month of March alone. It is the most checks conducted in a single month since the FBI\u2019s National Instant Background Check (NICS) system was launched in 1998. Which states have the most checks? By far, the state leading in federal firearm background checks in March was Illinois -- with over half a million checks conducted -- followed by Texas, Kentucky, Florida, and California.\u00a0 Under US law,\u00a0federally licensed gun dealers\u00a0must run checks\u00a0on every buyer, whether a purchase is made in a store or at a gun show.\u00a0 \u201cThe rise in gun and ammunition sales during this crisis is understandable as the fear of the unknown can drive purchasing far off their norms,\u201d said Jonathan Wackrow, CNN Law Enforcement Analyst and former special agent with the US Secret Service. \n\u201cResearch has shown that during a crisis, if individuals let fear, anxiety, and confusion spread, they will most likely begin to feel helpless. For many, the purchase of a weapon resolves that sense of helplessness.\u201d ##Daily Life## Only a portion of the medical supplies being flown in by the Federal Emergency Management Agency from overseas are being allotted to critical hotspots -- the rest are going onto the private market. Competition between states and the federal government has been a source of frustration for governors trying to shore up equipment to treat patients with coronavirus, according to multiple officials.\u00a0 The Trump administration has touted the incoming flights, billing them and the equipment they're bringing in as a reprieve to states desperate for supplies.  But states are not the sole recipients of the equipment, according to a FEMA spokesperson. Supplies will also be sent to the private market, where states have been in fierce competition with each other to get hold of hard-to-come-by supplies.\u00a0 \"These supplies will soon be distributed around the country. We have large cargo planes coming in from various parts of the world,\" President Donald Trump said during Wednesday's briefing, noting it includes gloves, gowns, goggles and masks. \"We're adding more and more.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump has suggested that states are overestimating their needs, previously saying, \"Some people frankly think they need them and they don't need,\" referring to ventilators.\u00a0 Read the full story here: ##Health## People leaving their homes for essential activities in California are not required to wear  surgical masks, according to new guidance by the state's Department of Public Health. \"The guidance does not require people to wear face coverings \u2013 and is not a substitute for the state\u2019s current guidance regarding social distancing and hand washing,\" the department said in a news release. \"The state also does not recommend Californians use N-95 or surgical masks, which are needed for our health care workers and first responders who will be there for when our lives at risk.\" The department also said that wearing a cloth face covering could provide some protection from the spread of the novel coronavirus. \u201cFace coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing or frequent hand washing, which we know are amongst the most effective ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health and state health officer, in the news release.\n\u201cWearing a cloth face covering could provide some additional benefit by acting as a reminder for other people to keep their distance, and it could help reduce the spread of infectious particles from those who could be infected but don\u2019t have symptoms.\u201d LA mayor asks residents to consider health workers: The official advice comes after Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti announced that residents should wear non-medical grade face masks or coverings when in public to save essential personal protective equipment for frontline medical workers. \u201cPlease do not get medical grade or surgical masks, or N95 masks.

About 70 people in their 20s chartered a plane from Austin, Texas, to Mexico for spring break two weeks ago. They went against the advice of White House officials who asked that people\u00a0avoid gathering in groups\u00a0of more than 10 and nonessential air travel. Now 44 of those people have tested positive for coronavirus -- all of them University of Texas at Austin students, a university spokesman told CNN on Wednesday. An elected official had a blunt message for the spring breakers. \"Quit being an a**,\" Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen told\u00a0CNN affiliate KXAN. \"Get over yourselves.

One of the biggest criticisms was that the government body charged with supporting women appeared to be ignoring concerns about a rise in domestic violence that may accompany stay-at-home orders to focus on things like how women should dress. The Malaysian All Women's Action Society called on the Women's Development Department to stop its sexist messaging and to focus on helping domestic violence survivors.  Women's Development Department director-general Akhma Hassan said the aim was to send out positive messages, according to state-run news agency Bernama.  \"The approach used was to share methods and practices to maintain positive relationships\u00a0within the family and during the\u00a0phase of working from\u00a0home,\" she said in a statement. \"We have taken note of numerous comments on some tips for women which were promoted through posters via our social media accounts. The Malaysian government and its leaders have faced accusations of sexism and misogyny on multiple occasions in recent years. During a debate on amending domestic violence laws in 2017, a member of parliament said husbands were \"abused\" when wives threw insults, withheld sex and denied consent for Muslim men to take another wife. ##Daily Life## Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top medical expert on the pandemic in the US, and a member of President Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, is facing threats to his personal safety. Fauci now requires personal security from law enforcement at all times, including at his home, a source has confirmed to CNN.\u00a0 A law enforcement official told CNN that the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General, the agency's law enforcement arm, asked the US Marshals Service for assistance following threats to Fauci.  The Marshals then deputized HHS officers to act as personal security for the doctor. The Washington Post first reported the threats to Fauci. Anger over lockdown measures: As Fauci's profile in the pandemic crisis has grown, so has the concern for his welfare.  The doctor's guidance to Trump for the country to remain as locked down as possible to help control the virus spread has not earned fans among some fervent right-wing voices. The exact nature of the threats and where they emanated from remains unclear.  Read the full story here: ##Daily Life## South Korea is nearing 10,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) announced 89 new cases in a news release today, adding that South Korea has now recorded 9,976 cases of the virus. Among the 89 new cases, 14 are from Seoul, 21 from Daegu, 17 from Gyeonggi province, 18 from airport screening, and the rest from other parts of the country, according to the news release.\u00a0 The national death toll is 169, after four deaths were reported on Wednesday. More than 58% of patients have recovered: South Korea, which just a month ago was the worst-affected country outside China, has recently seen a drop in new coronavirus  infections. Today the country reported that a total of 5,828 patients have recovered -- just over 58% of the total recorded. ##Health## Editor's note: Jeremy Douglas is the Regional Representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. To say the global novel coronavirus pandemic is causing chaos and affecting lives in real and tangible ways is certainly no understatement. But one impact that has not received significant attention is how its spread is hurting the efforts of governments to combat transnational organized crime and trafficking -- especially in Asia, where the outbreak began. The virus and the strong measures required to combat its spread are challenging the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) ability to bring Asia's law enforcement and justice authorities together to share information and intelligence, and to plan and conduct joint operations. Though the movement of people and goods across borders has slowed, international and cross-border cooperation is more necessary than ever given the presence of multibillion dollar trafficking syndicates in the region. Behind the scenes, Covid-19 has impacted how many governments and the United Nations run on a day-to-day basis, in ways not all appreciate and many are yet to understand.

Three inmates at the low-security prison have now died from the virus, including two on Wednesday.\u00a0 No details about the inmate were immediately available, the BOP said. All three deaths in the federal prison system have so far occurred at the Louisiana facility, which houses 980 male offenders.  Number of infected prisoners growing: As of Wednesday, 57 federal inmates have been officially diagnosed with coronavirus -- up from 28 on Monday -- in addition to 37 BOP staff members. Wednesday also saw the first day of a heightened state of lockdown at the nation's 122 federal prisons. Under a new BOP protocol, the fifth phase of its Covid-19 Action Plan, inmates began a two-week period\u00a0confined in their cells with limited exceptions for education programs, health treatment and some prison services.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Daily Life## ##Health## The US Treasury Department, clearing up confusion, said Wednesday that Social Security recipients will not have to file a tax return in order to receive the economic stimulus payments the government is preparing to send out. It was unclear in earlier guidance whether Social Security recipients who don\u2019t normally need to file taxes would have to in order to receive the money. However, those beneficiaries will automatically receive the money, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. The IRS will use the information that the Social Security Administration has on file. \u201cSocial Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account,\u201d\u00a0said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement. But those who do not receive their Social Security benefits via direct deposit will be sent a paper check. How much will people receive? Individuals are due up to $1,200 and couples will receive up to $2,400 -- plus $500 per child.\u00a0But payments start phasing out\u00a0for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000.  The amount will then be reduced by $5 for every additional $100 of adjusted gross income, and those making more than $99,000 will not receive anything. The income thresholds would be doubled for couples. ##Daily Life## The Trump administration will no longer ship personal protective equipment to allies overseas as the United States grapples with shortages of critical medical supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. A congressional source told CNN Wednesday that they were informed late last Friday night that the coronavirus task force -- led by Vice President Mike Pence -- was stopping overseas shipments of the medical equipment and instead asking that the supplies be distributed within the US. Asked about reports of the freeze on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said there was \u201cno truth whatsoever\u201d to them. However, minutes later, he noted that \"whatever we have, whatever we've committed to, we commit,\" but added \"we also need a lot for ourselves.\" \"Obviously we're not going to be shipping too much,\" he said during a White House briefing. Politico was the first to report on the freeze. CNN has reached out to the State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID) for comment. ##Health## Edging toward 1 million cases: The novel coronavirus has infected more than 932,000 people and killed over 46,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking World Health Organization figures and additional sources.  United States worst hit: The US has recorded more than 211,700 cases, according to a CNN count. At least 4,762\u00a0people have died nationwide -- over 1,300 in New York City alone. At least 928 new fatalities have been reported on Wednesday -- the highest single-day figures during the outbreak. Dwindling supplies: President Trump said the US Strategic National Stockpile is nearly depleted as hospitals across the country are in need of millions more masks, protective gear and thousands of ventilators. Aircraft carrier cases: Nearly 3,000 sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt will be evacuated from the aircraft carrier and quarantined in hotels in Guam after a desperate plea for help as the number of coronavirus cases aboard the ship approaches 100. The situation in Europe: Spain\u00a0has now recorded more than 104,000 cases, while the UK reported its highest number of deaths in one day, with 563 new fatalities. In Italy, a slowdown in the rate of coronavirus patients is a \"confirmation of a hope,\" officials say. Lockdowns extended: Italy, Germany and Pakistan are among countries that are extending their lockdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus. ##Health## ##Travel## ##Business## ##Daily Life## As the number of novel coronavirus cases in California approaches 10,000, doctors at a Los Angeles hospital say they are seeing an increase in patients showing Covid-19 symptoms, causing a reduction in capacity and the rationing of protective equipment for medical workers. \u201cWe know every day that we are likely to come in contact with someone with the virus,\u201d said Dr. Broderick Franklin, an emergency room physician in Los Angeles. Franklin, who works at Centinela Hospital Medical Center and two smaller hospitals in the area, said that while fewer people are showing up at the emergency department seeking treatment, more are showing coronavirus-like symptoms and being admitted.  Centinela Hospital, a private institution which treats more than 60,000 patients a year in its emergency room, has set up two Covid-19 curbside tents outside its ER as it prepares for the outbreak to intensify as it has in New York. About 80% of the ventilators at Centinela Hospital are now in use by patients, one hospital administrator said, and their supply is low. All of this increased need for hospital care is also impacting personal protection equipment supplies throughout Los Angeles County. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough PPE. They often have to be rationed out,\u201d Franklin said, noting that some hospitals will lock up the equipment in a drawer or cabinet.  ##Health## As the US health-care system has scrambled to track the spread of\u00a0coronavirus, one of the nation's largest commercial labs has faced a backlog of tests that ballooned in the past two weeks. Delayed results in some cases take up to 10 days. New Jersey-based Quest Diagnostics had about 160,000 coronavirus test orders waiting to be processed on March 25, which amounted to about half of the 320,000 total orders for the tests the company had received up to that date, according to Quest internal materials obtained by CNN. The company, which is now testing for the virus at a dozen labs across the country, referred to the orders as a \"significant amount of backlog,\" according to the materials. Although a vast network of labs at public health departments and universities are also testing for the novel coronavirus, the Trump administration has leaned on commercial labs, which have greater capacity, to roll out widespread testing Read the full story here: ##Health## President Donald Trump said he won't issue a national stay-at-home order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases. \u201cStates are\u00a0different and I understand that\u00a0the governor of Florida, great\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis issued one today and that\u2019s good, that\u2019s great.\u00a0But there are some states that are\u00a0different.\u00a0There are some states that don't\u00a0have much of a problem,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states, depending on how bad individual states' situations might be. \u201cYou have to look -- you have to\u00a0give a little\u00a0flexibility.\u00a0If you have a state in the\u00a0Midwest, or if Alaska for\u00a0example doesn't have a problem,\u00a0it's awfully tough to say close it down.\u00a0We have to have a little bit of\u00a0flexibility,\u201d Trump said. Some context: Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the 30 days to slow the spread guidelines should be viewed as a national stay-at-home order on Wednesday morning.\u00a0 \u201cMy advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay-at-home order.

On the Rotterdam, 14 passengers have exhibited flu-like symptoms. ##Travel## Dr. Deborah Birx said a coronavirus antibody test could be available \u201cwithin this month\u201d and says,\u00a0\u201cI've really called on every\u00a0university and every state to\u00a0develop ELISA\u2019s, you can buy the antigens and the\u00a0controls online, and really work\u00a0to test entire health care\u00a0communities in your state and\u00a0support them that way.\u201d The ELISA, or\u00a0enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,\u00a0detects and measures antibodies in blood. If successful, the test could help identify those who have already had the virus, but have since recovered. Experts say that if a person has had the virus and developed antibodies, it will most likely mean they have built up immunity and the chances of that person being infected again drops dramatically.\u00a0 Birx said that the test could help identify frontline medical workers who may have had the coronavirus and not know it. \u201cI think really being able to\u00a0tell them, the peace of mind\u00a0that would come from knowing you\u00a0already were infected, you have\u00a0the antibody, you are safe from\u00a0reinfection.\u00a099.9% of the time,\" Birx said.
