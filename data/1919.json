Coronavirus\u00a0 Any hopes that the Wuhan coronavirus was slowing down have been dashed after 242 deaths and 14,000 more cases of the virus were reported yesterday. The spike is partly due to the fact that doctors are now diagnosing patients based on their symptoms\u00a0and not just the results of a test. However, the World Health Organization says it's common during an outbreak to adapt the definition of a case. A vast majority of cases have been confined to mainland China, but the WHO cautioned that, at this stage, the virus would \"create havoc\" if it reached a country with inadequate medical infrastructure. Several major events in China have been shuttered over virus fears, including Shanghai's Fashion Week and the Hong Kong and Singapore legs of the World Rugby Sevens Series. The Tokyo Olympics, however, are still on track for this summer.\u00a0 2. Department of Justice\u00a0\u00a0 The fallout from the Roger Stone sentencing controversy, coupled with general post-impeachment uneasiness, is boosting tensions\u00a0at the Department of Justice.\u00a0Attorney General William Barr is under scrutiny from DOJ colleagues and Democratic opponents for\u00a0his role in requesting a lighter sentence for Stone, Trump's former associate, after the President complained. Barr has played a role in other high-profile cases of interest to Trump and regularly faces allegations of political tampering within the DOJ. The Stone incident just adds to those claims. Democrats want to investigate Barr's conduct, but Republicans say they see no reason to. However, Barr has agreed\u00a0to testify before the House Judiciary Committee next month\u00a0and will likely have to answer questions about the Stone sentencing and other\u00a0controversies. 3. Election 2020 Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price has resigned following last week's Iowa caucus debacle. Price and other Democratic officials agreed there was no way he could continue being the head of the state's party after a glitch delayed caucus results by days. The Iowa Democratic Party will soon begin a partial recanvass of voting precincts\u00a0flagged as having potentially inaccurate results. If there are\u00a0no major discrepancies, the party will declare Pete Buttigieg the winner, followed closely by Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg, who was not on the ballot in Iowa or New Hampshire, is facing backlash for a 2015 video in which he uses racially charged language to praise New York City's controversial stop-and-frisk\u00a0policy. Bloomberg said the comments do not reflect his thinking now or how he led as mayor.\u00a0 4. Israel Israeli leaders are furious after the United Nations published a\u00a0database of more than 100 companies it says are doing business in\u00a0Israeli settlements\u00a0in\u00a0occupied\u00a0Palestinian territories. That kind of business activity is a no-go since the settlements are considered illegal, having been built on land captured from Jordan by Israel\u00a0in the 1960s. (Israel and the US dispute these definitions.) Most of the 112 businesses listed are Israeli, but others include\u00a0Motorola Solutions, General Mills, Trip Advisor and Airbnb. Israel's\u00a0foreign minister said the list, which was commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council, is discriminatory against Israel. Palestinian leaders and others say it holds Israel and other nations accountable for actions in the highly contested area.\u00a0 5. Deepwater Horizon The catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill that ravaged the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was actually about 30% bigger than originally thought, according to a new study. Researchers say layers of\u00a0\"invisible and toxic oil\" that weren't detectable by satellites made the spill much worse than it appeared. This oil was discovered using computer simulations, and the results suggest that satellites and other observation equipment now in use may not be enough to properly determine the magnitude of oil spills. The 2010\u00a0spill began after a deadly explosion on a\u00a0BP-contracted Transocean Ltd. Deepwater Horizon rig\u00a0and\u00a0is considered one of the worst environmental disasters in US history.
