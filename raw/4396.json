Brooks was the only female staff photographer at Look, a biweekly American magazine that highlighted general-interest stories from 1937 to 1971.

It's encouraging now when students view past generations as trailblazers and realize these things can no longer deter them,\" Guzy said. \"I was fortunate to have editors that trusted me but were also hyperfocused on the stories. Most female photojournalists I've known early on were quite dedicated and just did the work, which spoke volumes.

It's what the workers do there as well, because they don't want the bears to get too familiar with humans. Vitale has traveled to more than 100 countries during her career, she said, bearing witness to not only violence and conflict but also surreal beauty and the enduring power of the human spirit. In recent years, she has shifted her focus to stories about wildlife and the environment. \"Storytelling and photography have the unique ability to transcend all languages and help us understand each other,\" she said. \"They remind us of our deep connection to all of life that we share this planet with.\"  Akili Ramsess, seen here in 1981, is executive director of the National Press Photographers Association. Before that, she held a variety of roles in newsrooms across the country. \"As much as I love being behind the camera, I came to see how necessary it was to be a voice in the newsroom as a visual advocate, particularly regarding images of people of color and women,\" she said. \"In the process of following my path and my passion, it never occurred to me I was a trailblazer. That as an African-American woman, I was treading a path that only a handful had traveled. It was always about telling the story and loving the craft of photography as my tool.\" Karen T.

She has been nominated twice for the Pulitzer Prize, and in 2001 she and her colleagues won a national reporting Pulitzer for their series \"How Race is Lived in America.\" She feels a responsibility to help mentor other young women of color who want to become photojournalists. \"It's kind of interesting because I walk into places and it's: 'There's the legend. There's our unicorn right there.' Because unicorns are rare, just as black women photojournalists are,\" she "], "Language": false}
