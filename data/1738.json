He's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a leader he's often been compared to for his strongman, nationalist\u00a0style. Trump and Modi shared a stage during a rally before large crowds in Modi's hometown of Ahmedabad, in the state of Gujarat. While Trump and Modi have been effusive in their praise of each other, relations between Washington and Delhi are not the strongest right now. The two leaders are expected to hash out disagreements on security and trade. The visit also comes at a turbulent moment for India\u00a0\u2014 Modi has faced criticism at home and abroad for what some view as attempts to move India away from a secular democracy and toward a Hindu nationalist\u00a0state. Trump's visit could help boost Modi and provide an endorsement of his\u00a0policies. 2. Coronavirus Authorities worldwide are rushing to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, as some countries outside China\u00a0experience a massive spike in infections and others report their first cases. The virus has reached more than 30 other countries and territories, and is spreading in Europe and the Middle East.\u00a0South Korea now has the most cases of the virus outside China, with more than 800. About half of the\u00a0cases there are linked to a branch of a controversial religious group. Italy\u00a0has the largest number of coronavirus cases outside Asia.\u00a0Infections there\u00a0jumped from three to 152 over the weekend, with three deaths so far. Fears are rising in the Middle East too.\u00a0Iran has confirmed 43 coronavirus\u00a0cases, including\u00a0eight deaths.\u00a0Lebanon, Israel, Kuwait and Afghanistan have also reported cases. The global death toll now stands at more than 2,600, while more than 79,000 people have been sickened. 3. Kobe Bryant Fans are set to pack the Staples Center in Los Angeles today to remember NBA legend Kobe Bryant, whose death -- along with the deaths of\u00a0his daughter\u00a0and seven others --\u00a0shocked the world last month. The Black Mamba\u00a0and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were laid to rest at a cemetery near the Pacific coast nearly two weeks ago. In the days following their deaths, the area in front of the Staples Center\u00a0became a massive fan memorial with flowers, jerseys and other mementos.\u00a0The memorial service\u00a0will be\u00a0a \"celebration of life\" on a symbolic date:\u00a0Kobe Bryant wore No. 24 in the latter part of his career, while his daughter Gianna wore No. 2 for her youth basketball teams. The service\u00a0begins at 10 a.m. PT. 4. Election 2020 Bernie Sanders is on a roll. After a massive victory\u00a0at the Nevada caucuses on Saturday, the Vermont senator has emerged as the undisputed frontrunner in the Democratic presidential race. He's well ahead of the other candidates in a new national poll released Sunday, and picked up an endorsement from former contender Marianne Williamson. Sanders is now poised to potentially pick up wins in South Carolina and then on Super Tuesday that could clear his path to the Democratic nomination. But Sanders' rise has set off alarm bells among the Democratic establishment and his moderate rivals in the race, who argue that Sanders' agenda would pave the way for four more years of Trump. But so far, moderate voters haven't united around a single candidate, making it harder to slow him down. The next nine days will determine whether Sanders' revolution will be able to help him clinch the nomination. 5. Russia A top election security official appears to have overstated the US intelligence community's formal assessment of\u00a0Russian interference in the 2020 election. Shelby Pierson told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia was trying to help Trump get re-elected. Now, three national security officials say she omitted some important nuance. Russia is interfering in the 2020 election and it does view President Trump as a leader it can work with, according to US intelligence.\u00a0But\u00a0the US\u00a0doesn't have evidence that Russia is interfering specifically to help Trump \u2014 right now, Russia's only clear aim is to sow discord in the US, one official said. Separately, intelligence officials have warned Bernie Sanders that Russia is trying to boost him in the Democratic primaries, though they have not determined that Russia wants him to win the general election.
