We've rounded up advice from over a dozen celebs who frequently share their fitness and nutrition routines on social media. The overarching theme? They work hard for those A-list bodies. They also stress health, wellness and \u2014 hooray! \u2014 self-care. From superhero-playing actors to busy moms who put women half their age to shame, here's a little motivation to make health a priority in the new year.  Serena Williams Serena Williams is considered by many to be the greatest female tennis player of all time, and was even named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade. She recently won the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, her first title since giving birth to her daughter three years ago. \"It feels good,\" Williams told CNN. \"It's been a long time. I've been waiting two years for this moment. I think you could see the relief on my face.\"  She also spoke about the importance of staying positive. \"You have to be your biggest cheerleader, especially if you're feeling you're not doing everything right \u2014 or even if you are doing everything right but things aren't working out for you,\" she added. Recently, Williams even tried out a little boxing with Mike Tyson to mix things up, and she's recommending her favorite health and fitness gear for 2020 in her Amazon store.

Jennifer Lopez Turning 50 in 2019 did nothing to slow JLo down. Not only did she bare nearly all as a stripper in \"Hustlers,\" and wow fans when she strutted down the Versace runway in the same dress she made famous 20 years ago, but she and fiance Alex Rodriguez started a viral fitness trend with their 10-day no-sugar, no-carbs challenge. Lopez told Ellen Degeneres that even though she works out a lot, her trainer suggested going carb- and sugar-free for 10 days to move the needle for her \"Hustlers\" role. \"He's like, 'Let's just cut it out.' I was like, 'Completely? Like cold turkey?' And he's like, yes,\" she told the talk show host. \"Ten days. It was really hard.\" But, she added, it worked.

Chris Pratt When you play a superhero, you need a superhero physique, and Pratt's open about sharing the fitness routines that got him there with us mere mortals. \"I like to mix it up...I'll lift weights. I do cardio, I'll do some yoga. I like to box...I'm always trying different things out,\" he says on Amazon, where he has a store featuring some of his favorite workout gear. \"Being active is more than just about getting fit -\u2014 the mental and emotional benefits go far beyond the physical.

Kumail Nanjiani Fans of Nanjiani who know him from \"Silicon Valley\" and \"The Big Sick\" were stunned when the comedian posted a couple of \"thirsty shirtless\" pics on Instagram last month. \"I found out a year ago I was going to be in Marvel's Eternals and decided I wanted to transform how I looked,\" he wrote. \"I would not have been able to do this if I didn't have a full year with the best trainers and nutritionists paid for by the biggest studio in the world.\" One of those trainers, Grant Roberts, told The Hollywood Reporter that Nanjiani's intense training sessions averaged four to five times a week.

(A full-on keto plan isn't for everyone, though: Talk to a health care provider if you're thinking about making changes to your diet.) Zac Efron When killer abs are part of your job (hello, \"Baywatch\"), fitness has to be part of your daily routine. Efron often shares gym \u2014 and shirtless \u2014 photos on social media, but getting that six-pack is no easy task. His trainer, Patrick Murphy, shared the \"Baywatch\" workout with Men's Health.
