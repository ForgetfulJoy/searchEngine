With all of that socializing, when's the last time you actually got a few peaceful moments alone? No, holing yourself up in the basement to wrap gifts doesn't count. Please, I beg of you, try and find at least one of those peaceful moments this weekend. Those gifts will be there when you come back. And if you run out of time, hey, stick 'em in a bag, wad up some tissue and call it a day. No one will judge you.  Our favorites this week Get going with some of our most popular good news stories of the week All hands on deck  Running a small business is hard enough, but when the unthinkable happens, it can become nearly impossible to do it alone. Dave McAdams and his wife Tina own The Local Coffee Company in Oak Grove, Oregon. Sadly, Dave has terminal cancer, and recently entered hospice care. Obviously, the last thing anyone wanted to think about was coffee, so the owner of a nearby coffee shop decided to step in and support the family. Tina says Pixie Adams, the owner of Moonlight Coffee, closed her shop for a day and ran the McAdams' shop, free of charge. It turned out to be a record day: Coffee lovers lined up for their usual lattes, cappuccinos and treats, and ended up raising $3,000 in sales and donations.

Mena has cerebral palsy,and uses a manual wheelchair and a reverse walker to get around. She first participated the holiday race six years ago but was so behind the rest of the pack officials had to open the course to traffic. She finished anyway and vowed to try again. \"I felt like it was a huge achievement,\" she said. She started training for the race in March, walking various routes with hills and inclines even though the 110-degree summer heat. In the run-up to the event, Mena decided to use her journey to inspire others. She created a fundraising page to raise money for Opportunity Village, a non-profit that helps people with disabilities find jobs or pursue their dreams. With one personal record smashed, she's now looking for new challenges. \"Be confident in yourself,\" she says. \"Achieve your end goal. And be happy about it.\" They go together  How do you surprise song and screen legend Olivia Newton John? How about buying her iconic black leather \"Grease\" jacket for $243,200 and ... return it to her as a gift? That's what an anonymous buyer did recently at a charity auction. Newton-John's reaction when she's presented with the mystery package is priceless, but it's what the buyer said afterward that will really leave your heart fluttering: \"This jacket belongs to you and the collective soul of those who love you, those for whom you are the soundtrack of their lives. It should not sit in a billionaire's closet for country club bragging rights,\" he said. \"For this reason, I humbly and respectfully return it to its rightful owner, which is you.\" The jacket was part of a huge collection of memorabilia Newton-John, a breast cancer survivor, auctioned off to raise funds for her cancer center. So now, the cancer center gets the money, and Newton-John gets the jacket, which she said she will proudly display in the center's halls.  Raise a glass to...

Dignified? No. Hilarious? Yeah, pretty much.   Wanna get away? Full disclosure: I am not a cold weather person. I once spent a weekend \"skiing\" in Vermont, and by \"skiing\" I mean huddled close to a wood-burning stove while snow piled up outside and my heartier friends trekked out to the slopes. I haven't been back since. So, for all of my fellow humans who would much rather look at a beautiful northern landscape than be in one, this idyllic scene in Stowe, Vermont is for you.
