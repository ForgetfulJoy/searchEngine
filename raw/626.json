Election 2020 Bernie Sanders has bowed out of the 2020 presidential race, clearing the path for Joe Biden to become the Democratic nominee and face off with Donald Trump in November. Sanders told his staff it was a matter of numbers: After some early primary wins, the Vermont senator fell behind a surging Biden and never quite regained traction. Now that Biden is the last candidate standing, some have urged his party to call off this summer's Democratic convention in light of coronavirus dangers. Now, national focus will shift to how Biden and Trump square up with each other. Easier said than done, in this mercurial coronavirus age, but one thing's certain: Trump is in danger of entering the election home stretch without the roaring economy that has been a cornerstone of his presidential promise.\u00a0\u00a0 2. Coronavirus\u00a0 With coronavirus cases ebbing and flowing around the globe, countries are preparing for the future when it comes to social distancing and preventative measures. Spain says they have reached the peak of their outbreak, and UK leaders have met to talk about a possible exit strategy from lockdown restrictions even as Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in intensive care with Covid-19. White House aides are discussing plans to reopen the US economy\u00a0as early May, but that plan could run afoul of advice from medical experts. Wednesday marked a new deadliest day for the US, with 1,922 coronavirus-related deaths. Meanwhile, Russia and Germany are seeing their coronavirus numbers rise. In India, the government has completely sealed more than 100 \"containment zones\" until mid-April. In Bangladesh, the world's largest refugee camp has been locked down to keep the virus from spreading among the camp's 1 million Rohingya refugees. Follow here for the latest.\u00a0 \u00a0 3. World Health Organization The WHO\u00a0is defending itself after President Trump repeatedly criticized the organization for its response to the coronavirus crisis and threatened to pull federal funding.\u00a0WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked Trump to not politicize the virus and instead promote unity in fighting its spread. French President Emmanuel Macron also defended the organization after a call with Ghebreyesus, saying the organization is critical to the global coronavirus response. The WHO has been criticized for their early response to the virus, when it was just beginning to spread in China. However, by the end of January, the organization had\u00a0designated the virus a \"public health emergency of international concern.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 4. Cruise ships\u00a0 Another lawsuit has been leveled against a cruise ship company for their response to the coronavirus.\u00a0A former passenger of the Costa Luminosa is suing the ship's operator, claiming the company put more than 2,000 people at risk by failing to warn them about potential exposure to the virus. Numerous passengers\u00a0from two separate journeys tested positive for Covid-19, and at least three have died. Meanwhile,\u00a0Australian police have\u00a0boarded the Ruby Princess cruise ship\u00a0to\u00a0investigate how thousands of passengers were allowed to disembark in Sydney last month. That influx resulted in a spike of coronavirus infections. More than 600 cases and 15 deaths have been linked to the ship. 5. Syria\u00a0 A chemical weapons watchdog group\u00a0has concluded that\u00a0Syrian government forces were responsible for a series of chemical attacks in the country that shocked the world in March of 2017.\u00a0The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons' Investigation and Identification Team said the sarin gas bombings could have only been authorized by members of the\u00a0Syrian Arab Republic military command. Human rights organizations and US officials agreed the report irrefutably shows the Syrian regime and the country's president Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against civilians, an act that\u00a0US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said rises to the \"level of war crimes.\" Chemical warfare is prohibited under the Geneva Protocol.\u00a0\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Linda Tripp, a pivotal player in Bill Clinton's impeachment scandal, has died\u00a0 Tripp was 70, and had battled breast cancer before being diagnosed with\u00a0late stage pancreatic/lymph node cancer.\u00a0 Baking can reduce stress and give comfort during these times\u00a0 At this rate, our kitchens are going to start looking like the bread aisle at a fully-stocked Costco.\u00a0 Waffle House started selling its signature waffle mix.
