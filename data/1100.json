Coronavirus\u00a0 The US government is now preparing for 18 months of the coronavirus pandemic, including multiple waves of illnesses. The ominous announcement comes after cases in the US spiked 40% in just 24 hours. About\u00a09,000 Americans have now tested positive for the virus, and at least 149 have died. Singapore also reported its biggest single-day jump in cases, and South Korea, which has been watching the number of infections slow\u00a0with reserved optimism, is now seeing a new spike in cases and clusters. Meanwhile, India is bracing for the arrival of 26,000 people from the Persian Gulf region, mostly blue-collar workers returning home from labor contracts in Gulf countries. The new arrivals will be quarantined for 14 days. And there is some brighter news out of China: The country has reported no new local infections for the first time since the pandemic began months ago, marking a critical step in containment. Follow along here for the latest.\u00a0 2. Election 2020 States are struggling with how to handle primary elections amid health fears and self-isolation. The debate has led Wisconsin Democrats to file suit to block state voting laws that they say would force people to choose between their health and their right to vote.\u00a0The plaintiffs\u00a0want to extend the deadline for online registration,\u00a0ease photo and absentee ballot requests, and extend the absentee mail-in ballot deadline ahead of the state's primary on April 7. If the regulations aren't eased, people will have to leave home to complete the paperwork necessary to vote. Other states have\u00a0postponed primaries over health concerns. 3. Immigration\u00a0 While Americans are adjusting to life under pandemic precautions, the Trump administration had made a dozen changes to the US immigration system in a little over a week. The Department of Justice closed immigration courts and postponed hearings. Guatemala\u00a0suspended its asylum agreement with the US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0adjusted its enforcement priorities, focusing on those who pose a public safety risk. ICE also said it will not\u00a0carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, except in \"extraordinary circumstances.\" And, refugee admissions have been paused. While some of these changes are temporary and in line with other public health measures, they also align with restrictionist policies that Trump officials have struggled to put into practice. 4. LGBT rights Idaho's legislature is moving forward with a controversial bill that would\u00a0effectively block transgender people in the state from changing the listed sex on their birth certificates to match their gender identity. The bill has attracted vocal opposition, and a federal judge even struck down a very similar attempt at a ban in the state two years ago. Critics and LGBT rights groups are not only frustrated that the bill may be approved by the governor, inviting further litigation, but also because many feel state leaders should be focusing on responding to the coronavirus instead. Most states, with the exception of Tennessee and Ohio, allow transgender people to change the gender on their birth certificates so they can get other official documentation, like driver's licenses and passports.\u00a0 5. Weather\u00a0 The winter storm threatening the US will\u00a0ramp up today. Blizzard conditions with heavy snow and high winds may blow\u00a0through parts of the Rockies into the Plains. From Texas to southern Indiana, the conditions may increase the risk of tornadoes. By tomorrow, the east and west sides of the US will look very different, with above average temperatures in the east\u00a0and below average temperatures to the west. But if you're in a warmer area, don't assume you're home free. Heavy rain and severe storms are expected\u00a0to bear down on\u00a0the southern Plains and\u00a0the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. BREAKFAST BROWSE These are the world's most expensive cities to live in\u00a0 And, of course, they all look beautiful.\u00a0 An earthquake shook a Mormon temple in Utah and knocked the trumpet from its iconic angel statue That doesn't seem foreboding at all.\u00a0 Apple unveils new iPad and MacBook Air products Now, of all times?!\u00a0 Meet Wonderchicken,\u00a0the oldest modern bird, which\u00a0lived with dinosaurs and survived their extinction\u00a0 Yes, we absolutely do want to meet anything called Wonderchicken.
