Coronavirus President Trump has put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the United States' coronavirus response amid growing concern\u00a0and criticism that the US is unprepared for a widespread outbreak. However,\u00a0Health and Human Services Secretary Alexander Azar\u00a0says\u00a0he is still in charge of the task force handling the disease. Azar, Pence and Trump have all downplayed the potential effects of the coronavirus, despite warnings from the US Centers for Disease Control. In California, a new case of coronavirus could represent the first instance of \"community spread\" in the US, a situation in which the patient didn't have relevant travel history or contact with another patient to explain their case. That would mark a new phase in the spread of the disease in the US, where there are at least 60 confirmed cases.\u00a0 2. Milwaukee mass\u00a0shooting An employee stormed the Molson Coors complex\u00a0yesterday and killed five people before turning the gun on himself. Police have not named the 51-year-old shooter or any possible motive, but they did\u00a0say he was an active employee at the brewing company. All the victims were Molson Coors employees; they\u00a0were found in the same building. The attack is one of Milwaukee's deadliest mass shootings and the 11th mass shooting in Wisconsin since 2004, the lieutenant governor\u00a0said. Molson Coors' CEO called the attack an unthinkable tragedy\u00a0and announced the company's corporate offices would be closed for the rest of the week, with\u00a0the brewery closed until further notice.\u00a0 3. Saudi Arabia Officials in Saudi Arabia have ordered the arrest of a rapper and her crew after their rap video, \"Mecca Girl,\" attracted attention online. The artist\u00a0goes by Asayel, and in the video, she's wearing\u00a0a headscarf and rapping about being a woman in Mecca, a city in Saudi Arabia that is considered the most holy place in Islam. The city's governor says the song \"offends the customs and traditions of the people of Mecca.\" Since the announcement, Asayel's YouTube presence has been wiped out. Saudi Arabia has been trying to modernize the strict social conventions it places on women. The country last year ended gender segregation in restaurants, and Saudi Arabian women in 2018 were finally allowed to drive. But\u00a0critics note\u00a0that the uproar over this music video shows the country's progress has some definite limits.\u00a0 4. 2020 Dems\u00a0 Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Michael Bloomberg, Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden all set aside their contentious debate strategies for back-to-back town halls last night in South Carolina. Warren said she is willing to take her campaign all the way to the democratic convention this summer if need be. It sounds like a pretty obvious claim, but remember that by the time the convention rolls around, a candidate has usually clinched a winning delegate majority. Theoretically, with this tight field of contenders, we could get all the way to the convention without a clear winner. That's when Warren says she'd make her final push. Meanwhile, after weeks of dodging and deflecting,\u00a0Bloomberg outright apologized for the controversial stop-and-frisk\u00a0policies\u00a0that peaked during his time as New York mayor. 5. DC sniper The US Supreme Court has dismissed the case of DC sniper Lee Boyd Malvo, who had requested\u00a0an appeal after he was\u00a0convicted for his role in the serial sniper shooting spree that rocked Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia 17 years ago. Despite being 17 at the time of the shootings, Malvo was handed several life sentences in relation to the killing spree, which left 10 dead and millions living in terror for weeks. However, a new Virginia law makes\u00a0juvenile offenders who were sentenced to life imprisonment eligible for parole after serving 20 years. In light of this new rule, both sides agreed any further court debate in this case isn't necessary. Still, Malvo still faces separate life sentences related to the killings in Maryland.
