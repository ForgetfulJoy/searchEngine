Beathard, has been arrested northwest of Nashville. Michael D. Mosley, 23, was arrested in a vacant house in Cheatham County, Metro Nashville Police announced Wednesday on Twitter. He was alone when he was taken into custody. Mosley is accused of  two counts of criminal homicide and one count of attempted criminal homicide, police said. Clayton Beathard, 22, and Paul Trapeni III, 21, were stabbed during a fight Saturday outside the Dogwood Bar. Speaking Monday, police spokesman Don Aaron said the investigation shows Mosley made unwanted advances toward a woman who was a friend of the victims. A verbal dispute occurred inside the bar, which led to physical fight outside the bar, Aaron said. It appears Mosley, armed with a sharp object, stabbed the victims, he said. Beathard and Trapeni were stabbed in their sides and taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where they died, police said. Autopsies showed the men died of stab wounds, Aaron said. Another 21-year-old man who was stabbed was hospitalized with wounds to his eye and arm, according to a news release from Nashville police. His identity has not been released and his condition was not immediately known. Police had said Mosley was among the four people wanted for questioning in surveillance video released this weekend.
