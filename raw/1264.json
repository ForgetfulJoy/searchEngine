The cancellations were initially focused in states and areas hardest hit by the virus, including the Seattle area, California and New York.  In some cases, online instruction is being offered for a limited period, or through the semester. Some schools are telling students to not return to campus for 14 days after their return, depending on the laws in their state. And many universities are issuing guidance on avoiding travel to China, Italy and South Korea, as students are on or about to go on spring break.  These are some of the major institutions that have taken action, including canceling or temporarily suspending in-classroom instruction: California \u2022 California Institute of the Arts  \u2022 Cal State Long Beach \u2022 University of California, Berkeley \u2022 University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) \u2022 University of Southern California \u2022 Stanford University Connecticut \u2022 Yale University Delaware \u2022 University of Delaware  District of Columbia \u2022 American University \u2022 Georgetown University \u2022 George Washington University Florida \u2022 University of Florida \u2022 University of North Florida \u2022 University of South Florida \u2022 University of West Florida \u2022 Florida Polytechnic University \u2022 Florida State University \u2022 New College of Florida \u2022 University of Central Florida \u2022 Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) \u2022 Florida Atlantic University \u2022 Florida Gulf Coast University \u2022 Florida International University Georgia \u2022  Emory University \u2022  Kennesaw State University \u2022  Georgia Southern \u2022  Georgia State University  \u2022  University of Georgia Illinois \u2022  Northwestern University \u2022  University of Illinois-Springfield  Indiana \u2022 Indiana University \u2022 Notre Dame \u2022 Purdue University Maine \u2022 Bowdoin College Maryland \u2022 Johns Hopkins \u2022 University System of Maryland \u2022 Morgan State University Massachusetts \u2022 Amherst College \u2022 Babson College \u2022 Boston College  \u2022 Boston University \u2022 Harvard University \u2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2022 University of Massachusetts \u2022 Tufts University  Michigan \u2022 Michigan State University \u2022 Eastern Michigan University  \u2022 Oakland University \u2022 Western Michigan University \u2022 Wayne State University \u2022 University of Michigan New Jersey \u2022 Princeton University \u2022 Rutgers \u2022 Drew University \u2022 New Jersey City University \u2022 New Jersey Institute of Technology New York \u2022 Columbia University and Barnard College \u2022 Cornell University \u2022 Hofstra University \u2022 Syracuse University \u2022 The City University of New York (CUNY) \u2022 New York University (NYU) \u2022 Yeshiva University  \u2022 Skidmore College North Carolina \u2022 Duke University \u2022 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u2022 University of North Carolina at Greensboro \u2022 Elon University Ohio \u2022 Ohio State University \u2022 Kent State University \u2022 University of Cincinnati \u2022 University of Dayton Oklahoma \u2022 University of Tulsa Pennsylvania \u2022 Penn State \u2022 West Chester University \u2022 University of Pittsburgh Rhode Island \u2022 Brown University  Tennessee \u2022 Vanderbilt Texas \u2022 Rice University  \u2022 Texas A&M University \u2022 Baylor University Virginia \u2022 University of Virginia \u2022 The College of William & Mary  \u2022 Virginia Tech Washington state \u2022 Seattle University \u2022 University of Washington Wisconsin \u2022 University of Wisconsin-Madison \u2022 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Study abroad programs A growing list of American universities have canceled study abroad programs as the novel coronavirus has spread around the world.
