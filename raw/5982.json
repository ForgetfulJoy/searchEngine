The singer put a spin on her classic, \"All I Want For Christmas Is You,\" with a new music video, released Thursday.  \"We wanted to make a modern classic,\" Carey said during a YouTube livestream for the video's debut. \"It's kind of the opposite of the original video.

Though it's been 25 years since the song debuted, Carey is still riding its wave of unfaltering success.  The single, which first premiered in 1994, just hit No. 1 for the first time on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. And Carey has earned more than $60 million in royalties from it, a 2016 estimate by The Economist found."], "Language": false}
