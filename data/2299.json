According to Lieutenant Nick Ward, the operation represents part of the Royal Navy's \"routine business\" and highlights their \"enduring commitment to uphold the security\" of the UK.  \"Portsmouth-based HMS Tyne spent more than a week working in the English Channel, in often challenging seas, keeping a close eye on the Russian vessels as they pass the south coast,\" the statement added.
