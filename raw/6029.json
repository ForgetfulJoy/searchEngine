I was there to participate in a panel alongside other women to talk about something we all had in common: abuse. We knew what it felt like to be hurt, to feel threatened, to feel forgotten by someone we loved. What was evident, though often forgotten, is that abuse doesn't only happen to \"certain people.\" Among the women who sat beside me that day was a TV executive, a musician, and a city leader. We all had our stories. Yet, when I looked around at the other women on the panel, I realized that I was the only white woman. In fact, I was one of maybe a handful of white women in the entire auditorium. Perhaps that's because 52% of people living in Atlanta are African American, according to the US Census Bureau. Atlanta ranks as the second largest majority black metro area nationally. The CDC also reports black women, on average, experience domestic abuse at a higher rate than white women. Whatever the reason for the makeup of that audience, there's one thing I knew: our commonalities were stronger than our differences.    And we must remember this: no woman, no matter her race, is a statistic. We're mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends. Our shared experiences and support for one another are far more potent and powerful than our physical differences. My fellow panelists and I talked about moments of intense fear -- of being called names we couldn't repeat, of being betrayed, and physically and mentally abused. We shared those moments we all had of feeling hopeless. The audience was silent as each of us spoke. These women who sat before us were fixed on what we had to share because they could each relate. When it was my turn to speak, I talked about being thrown into a wall and my ex threatening to bash my head into it. I talked about how he would come home in the middle of the night, rip the covers off of me, get right up in my face and scream at me like a drill sergeant. I talked about what it did to me emotionally. I felt unworthy of having anything good in my life -- my family, my friends, my job. I wore shame every day, disguising it with a smile. But one day, that changed. I sat in a church parking lot crying and begging God to tell me what to do. In that moment, something in me shifted. I don't know if it was because I finally got brutally honest with myself or because I was so desperate to feel peace again, but I know this: by the grace of God, it was the beginning of the end of that relationship. I also knew I couldn't do it alone. The kind of healing I needed was too big and too heavy. I confided in a friend who connected me to a counselor and with his help, along with that of my family and friends, I got stronger. And I found my faith again. Faith was a big topic in that auditorium. All the women on the panel had a story of faith and we all agreed we had to find our worth in who God says we are, not who our abuser said we were. But our message was also about finding the strength through whatever was meaningful to us individually to survive and seek help. After the panel, I was getting ready to leave when a young woman ran up to me, tears in her eyes, and grabbed my hand. I pulled her aside and we sat and talked for quite some time. She told me she was living the nightmare that I had once endured. She was scared, fatigued and fighting to identify any ounce of hope. Then I asked if she had kids. That's when she lit up. I watched as her face, so beautiful yet so full of fear, suddenly transformed. I saw in her the same strength and determination that I had found all those years ago in that parking lot.  She talked about her precious little ones with such hope and love. I told her that they are a gift to her, but she too was a gift to them. We discussed steps she could take to get herself and her kids out of that abusive situation and how she could stay safe while getting help. As we sat there together, she said something I'll remember for the rest of my life. She chuckled, shook her head and said, \"When I saw you walk onto that stage I thought, 'What's this little white girl going to tell me about my life?'\" We both smiled. \"Who would have ever thought you'd be the one I'd connect with,\" she said. It was a powerful moment for both of us. I tell this story to share what we learned from each other that day: we're all so much more alike than we often admit. It doesn't matter how much money you have, the color of your skin, the job you hold or how much education you receive -- we're all human. We all matter. And we can all be united by the experiences we share and the power of lifting each other through our most excruciating moments.  Now, we're at a pivotal time in history: The time of \"Me Too,\" Black Lives Matter, All Lives Matter. The world feels more divisive with each passing day. But we can all be there for one another if we choose to be. We will always see our differences. That's the truth. But we can also choose to see our humanity and our commonality first. I wish I knew where that strong, brave woman is now. The one who sat with me feeling weakness and shame, yet who possessed extraordinary courage and strength. If only we'd all be that courageous, that open, that human. I challenge you to be those things.  You may not know this but, as we head into the holiday season, this is a time of year that can be particularly tough and lonely if you're in an abusive relationship or in a home where you don't feel safe. I found beautiful moments of happiness and comfort in the music and decorations of this season. It took me back to my childhood where I felt safe and loved. But it was a temporary comfort. It didn't dull the pain and fear or stop the abuse I lived with then. And while victims of abuse don't always admit to what they're going through or want to talk about it, please know that offering them a simple \"I'm here for you if you need me\" can be more healing than you'll ever realize.  We're all walking around with scars. But we can all be healers. "], "Language": false}
