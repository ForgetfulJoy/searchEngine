But finding a reliable course in a sea swimming with thousands of options is easier said than done. Sure, YouTube and Pinterest are great for quick hits and inspiration. When learning something new, though, you want a vetted instructor who can provide more in-depth direction.  And that's where our guide to e-learning courses comes in. We've narrowed down the long, long list of e-learning courses down by interests: food and drink, coding, arts and lifestyle. We focused on three of our favorite sites \u2014 Udemy, SkillShare and MasterClass \u2014 due to their sleek user interfaces, a wide breadth of courses to choose from,  solid customer reviews to back them up and instructors with a wealth of knowledge.

Pull out your trusty writing utensil and some sheets of paper and get to learning.  Food and Drink Yes, there might be countless cookbooks in your home. And yes, there are tons of recipes online.
