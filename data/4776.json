This Rocketman journey has been one of the highlights of my life and I'm grateful to be sharing this honor with my longtime friend and collaborator, Elton.  We have personally and professionally supported each other for decades, and my goal in writing these lyrics was to honor his legacy, strength, and perseverance as both an icon and compassionate friend. To think that what started as a chance encounter over 5 decades ago in a London diner would take us both on the journey of a lifetime is beyond even my imagination.
