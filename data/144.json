Another influential coronavirus model often cited by the White House is now forecasting a death toll of 134,000 \u2014 nearly double its previous estimate.   The depressing new projections dashed optimism stirred by more than half the country taking various steps to return to normal life, Stephen Collinson writes. While stay-at-home orders slowed the virus and flattened the curve in hotspots like New York and California, they have so far failed to halt its broader advance, leaving the nation stuck at around 30,000 new cases a day for nearly a month.    With no vaccine in sight, the steep price of reopening the country is now clear: tens of thousands more lives will be lost. But as coronavirus costs mount, and the Treasury Department looks to borrow a whopping $3 trillion this quarter to cover the federal government's response, Trump appears ready to pay.    And as world leaders came together for a virtual summit yesterday, pledging billions of dollars to develop and mass-produce vaccines, drugs and testing kits to fight the virus, one nation was conspicuously absent: the US.   YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED Q: How can cities contain a second wave of the virus?  A: When Hong Kong was hit by a second wave of the coronavirus in late February, the government took quick, aggressive action: barring non-residents from entering the city, halting travelers from transiting through the airport, and implementing strict quarantine and testing measures on all arrivals, regardless of origin. Those under home quarantine were given electronic bracelets to track their location. Now that the worst seems to have passed \u2014 Hong Kong hasn't had a case of local transmission in more than two weeks \u2014 here's a look at what the city did right.     Send your questions here.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY Intel contradicts Chinese lab-leak theory  Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's claims that the outbreak spread as a result of an accident in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, continue to be met with skepticism. Intelligence shared among Five Eyes nations -- United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand --  indicates that theory is \"highly unlikely,\" and points instead to evidence that the virus originated in a market in the same region, according to two Western officials who cited an intelligence assessment. The World Health Organization has also dismissed the Trump administration's \"speculative\" assertion.     And in an interview with National Geographic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said he doesn't believe the virus came from a lab: \"If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, (the scientific evidence) is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated.\"   Covid-19 may have been in France since December Doctors at a Paris hospital say they've found evidence that one patient admitted in December was infected with Covid-19. If verified, this finding would show that the virus was already circulating in Europe well before the first known cases were diagnosed in France or hotspot Italy.
