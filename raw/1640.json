We're wrapping up our live coverage. In case you missed it, here's the\u00a0key takeaway from each candidate's town hall: Michael Bloomberg: The billionaire businessman was called to task once again over his controversial record on stop-and-frisk, which he repeatedly defended while serving as mayor of New York. Bloomberg said tonight, \"we just did it much too much and an awful lot of innocent people got stopped.\" Stop-and-frisk searches\u00a0peaked under Bloomberg at 203,500 stops during the first three months of 2012.The\u00a0practice was cut back\u00a0amid protests and lawsuits.\nJoe Biden: The former vice president said he has spoken to Anita Hill, who made sexual harassment accusations against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and \"apologized for not being able to protect her more\" during Thomas' confirmation hearings, which Biden oversaw in 1991. Biden was asked what would happen if President Trump loses in November but refuses to concede. Biden said the way Trump has treated the military, the intelligence community and the FBI, \u201cI have no worry about him being escorted out of the White House.\u201d\u00a0\nAmy Klobuchar: Klobuchar vowed to fire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0in her \"first 100\u00a0seconds\" if elected president. The Minnesota senator also said she would be able to work with progressive Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, if elected, and pointed out that they already do in the Senate. \nElizabeth Warren: The Massachusetts senator is ready for a convention floor battle this summer if none of the Democratic candidates reach a delegate majority during the primary. Warren made it clear tonight that she'd be willing to lobby superdelegates, who have a vote on the second ballot if there's no outright winner, when asked if she would continue her candidacy even if she was trailing in the delegate count. She also tackled the issue of coronavirus, pledging to divert funds from President Trump's border wall and use \"every dime\" of it to fight the escalating health threat. Elizabeth Warren isn't saying if her home state of Massachusetts is a \"must-win\" on Super Tuesday. \"I'm grateful for those folks\" and their support, Warren said when asked. \"Always grateful.\" But on Wednesday night, like she has in the past, Warren didn't give a clear answer as to whether she believes victory in the Bay State is a requirement for her campaign on March 3. \u00a0 Watch: ##Warren## Elizabeth Warren said Wednesday that the best way to take on Donald Trump is to stand up to him because \u201cyou never back down from a bully.\" \u201cYou just can't.\u00a0I won't let him get behind me on\u00a0a debate stage,\u201d Warren said, seemingly in reference to the way that Trump loomed over Hillary Clinton during a general election debate in 2016. The comment came in response to a question about the way Trump gives his opponents nicknames, including an offensive name used for Warren. \u201cSo, do remember whoever the\u00a0nominee is Donald Trump will\u00a0have ugly names, tell lies, and\u00a0make it his personal and nasty\u00a0as he can,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSo, we're just there.\u00a0That's what's going to happen.\u201d But, Warren said, that Democrats cannot be consumed by fighting with Trump. \u201cThe way we'll beat Donald Trump\u00a0is by making this election not\u00a0just about Donald Trump,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI think the way we'll do it is\u00a0by talking about our vision.\u201d Watch the moment: ##Warren## When it comes to working with Republican on passing legislation, Sen. Elizabeth Warren cited a bill she authored aimed at the 40 million Americans who suffer from hearing loss. Warren cited how \"one\u00a0out of every six actually gets a\u00a0hearing aid.\u00a0Why?\u00a0Because a couple of hearing aids cost you in the neighborhood of\u00a0$5,000, not covered by\u00a0insurance, not covered by\u00a0medicare for most people.\u00a0They just can't afford it.\" \"So I started asking the question\u00a0a couple of years ago, why are\u00a0those darn things so expensive?\u00a0They're not as fancy in terms of\u00a0what they do as your iPhone, but\u00a0they cost a whole lot more.\u00a0The answer turns out to be the\u00a0hearing aid industry is one more\u00a0industry that has managed to\u00a0capture government to keep\u00a0prices up and competition down,\" Warren said. Warren's plan was simple: Sell hearing aids over the\u00a0counter. That plan is now a reality. President Trump signed Warren's Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017, which aims to make hearing aids more affordable and had bipartisan support. It requires the Food and Drug Administration to allow certain hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter to Americans with mild to moderate hearing loss. \"This law will make a life changing difference for millions of Americans who experience hearing loss but can't access the hearing aid technology they need because of high costs and excessive regulations,\" Warren said in a statement at the time of the President's signing.

Elizabeth Warren wants to snuff out cigarette addiction in the US and tackle an industry rife with \"corruption.\" Warren's discussion on cigarettes was prompted by a question from Tracy Smith,  a professor in addiction sciences, who said \"cigarette smoking\u00a0still kills 50% of long term\u00a0users and still the leading\u00a0cause preventable death in the\u00a0United States.\u00a0And worldwide.\" \"What will you do as president to help end cigarette\u00a0addiction and the disease burden\u00a0of tobacco in the country,\" Smith asked. Warren's answer focused on a \"tobacco\u00a0industry that still calling the\u00a0shots too often in Washington.\u00a0And that leans on the FDA to stay out of doing science\u00a0based, health based regulations,\" she said tonight during her town hall. \"So, this is my commitment, it's\u00a0my commitment across the board.\u00a0I don't owe anything to the\u00a0tobacco industry.\u00a0Or the drug industry.\u00a0Or the prison industrial\u00a0complex.\u00a0We can go through the list,\" Warren said. \"But on yours specifically, I want to\u00a0see an FDA that is science based.\u00a0That is research based.\u00a0And they make recommendations\u00a0and they make regulations that our based on that science\u00a0and nothing else.\u00a0I will have a head of the FDA who believes in science.\u00a0And then I will back that person\u00a0up 100%. I don't care about the political\u00a0pressure from the outside.\" Watch the moment: ##Warren## Elizabeth Warren once compared the race for the presidency to a movie. She said it was lonely. Here's why: \"Well, there's nobody else who is\u00a0out on stage with you, except a\u00a0guy who wants to ask you hard\u00a0questions.\u00a0And it is,\" she said. She then detailed something that makes her campaign unique: A selfie line. Warren described the stories of hardship she's heard from Americans across the country during her selfie lines. She went on to say \"the reason I say that's lonely, every one of those, it's like it comes in between your ribs.\" Her campaign and the race to the White House is a culmination of her \"life's work,\" she said. Hear her comments: ##Warren## Elizabeth Warren is ready for a convention floor battle this summer if none of the Democratic candidates reach a delegate majority during the primary. Warren made it clear on Wednesday night that she'd be willing to lobby superdelegates, who have a vote on the second ballot if there's no outright winner, when asked if she would continue her candidacy even if she was trailing in the delegate count. Asked by an audience member why the person who gets the most votes shouldn't be awarded the nomination, Warren said that the rules set a higher bar \u2014 and she intended fight to the last. Warren also suggested that Bernie Sanders' argument that a candidate with a plurality should be declared the nominee was disingenuous, noting that his 2016 campaign, despite losing to Hillary Clinton, publicly argued that convention superdelegates should consider swinging the contest in his favor. In the aftermath of that primary, in which the superdelegates overwhelmingly backed Clinton, Sanders and others struck a deal to dilute their power. Unlike four years ago, they will only be able to vote on a second ballot in 2020.  But in this crowded field, that compromise could come back to bite Sanders. \"The way I see this is, you write the rules before you know where everybody stands. And then you stick with those rules. So for me, Bernie had a big hand in writing these rules. I didn't write them,\" Warren said.  \"When they were putting together the 2016 platform for the Democratic convention, those are the rules he wanted to write. And others wanted to write. Everybody got in the race thinking that was the set of rules,\" she added. \"I don't see how come you get to change it because he thinks that an advantage to him for doing it.\" Watch: ##Warren## Dana Lang, an attorney, has a son with autism who is about to graduate from high school and eager to become independent.  During Sen. Elizabeth Warren's town hall tonight, Lang asked the Massachusetts lawmaker what plan she has for \"integrating this generation of\u00a0young adults with autism who are\u00a0ageing out of school system\" and what can she do to ensure people like him have \"meaningful lives in the\u00a0community?\" Warren cited her background as a special education teacher and how housing remains at the crux of her plan for helping people like Lang's son. \"I think of it as we have to\u00a0think about how we let every\u00a0human being in this country have\u00a0an opportunity to be all they\u00a0can be,\" Warren said. \"Housing for example.\u00a0There are a lot of people who\u00a0face challenges who want to be\u00a0able to live independently.\u00a0We have a problem in America.\u00a0We don't have enough housing\u00a0period.\u00a0And we sure don't have enough\u00a0housing for people who have\u00a0special requirements on housing.\u00a0Maybe group housing or somewhat\u00a0more supervised housing.\" Warren went on to explain how the US is in need of 3.2 million new housing units to help \"middle class families, for\u00a0working class families, housing\u00a0for the working poor.\u00a0Housing for the poor poor.\u00a0Housing for homeless.\u00a0For people with disabilities.\u00a0Housing for seniors who want to\u00a0age in place.\u00a0For people who have been\u00a0incarcerated and making it back\u00a0into the community.\" Warren added: \"We need to treat housing like a\u00a0basic human right.\u00a0And safe accessible housing for\u00a0everyone.\" See the moment: ##Warren## Elizabeth Warren outlined tonight the first executive order she would sign to address gun violence. She vowed that her first action would be to go after gun dealers. \"We have let so many loopholes\u00a0slip through.\u00a0It turns out that most of the data suggest it's a handful of dealers and people who show up at gun\u00a0shows who are getting most of the guns into circulation,\" Warren said. The Massachusetts senator went on to say she wants to address gun violence as if it were a \"public health emergency.\"  \"That's what I want to see us do\u00a0on guns.\u00a0I want to see us do the things\u00a0that are obvious the background\u00a0checks.\u00a0Get assault weapons off our\u00a0streets,\" she said. Hear Sen. Warren's response: ##Warren## Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday pledged to divert funds from President Trump's border wall and use \"every dime\" of it to fight the escalating threat of coronavirus. \"I'm going to be introducing a plan tomorrow to take every dime that the President is now spending on his racist wall at the southern border and divert it to work on the coronavirus,\" Warren said.  She also criticized the administration's announcement that Vice President Mike Pence would lead the current effort to combat the spread of the illness, saying his past performance in dealing with a health crisis had \"disqualified\" him from the job. \"Do keep in mind that this Vice President has dealt with a public health emergency before \u2014 in Indiana. And what was his approach? To put politics over science and let a serious virus expand in\u00a0his state and cost people lives,\" she said. During his time as governor, Pence hesitated in green-lighting a needle exchange program designed to stop the spread of HIV in a rural Indiana county. Under his watch, the outbreak spread and at least 200 people were infected.\u00a0 See her response: ##Warren## Sen. Elizabeth Warren was emphatic in her denouncement of domestic terrorism following a question from the pastor of Charleston's Mother Emanuel AME Church, where, in 2015, a white supremacist killed nine African-Americans during Bible study. Rev. Eric Manning asked the Massachusetts senator during her town hall tonight what her response would be \"to the families to\u00a0the survivors of those who\u00a0suffer at the hands of so much\u00a0hatred and evil.\u00a0And racism.\" \"With an open heart.\u00a0I also understand that we are\u00a0called onto act.\u00a0A pure heart by itself is not\u00a0enough.\u00a0That we are called onto put\u00a0action behind that.\u00a0Faith without deeds.\u00a0And so I think of this as the\u00a0place with need to start is that\u00a0we need a justice department and\u00a0president who treat white\u00a0supremacy as the domestic\u00a0terrorism that it is that\u00a0threatens this United States\u00a0every bit as much as terrorism,\" Warren said.  Warren added: \"That we commit as a people as a\u00a0government that we will\u00a0aggressively pursue white\u00a0supremacists and that we will\u00a0bring them to justice.\u00a0I also believe that we have to\u00a0redouble or efforts on gun\u00a0violence.\u00a0And as you know more than\u00a0anyone, gun violence is an issue\u00a0of mass shootings.\" Watch: ##Warren## Sen. Elizabeth Warren just took the stage at her CNN town hall in South Carolina, just days before the state's primary and Super Tuesday. ##Warren## Amy Klobuchar has a message for Democrats worried about the party's progressive-moderate divide. Chill. Asked how, if elected, she could work with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Klobuchar pointed out that they already do in the Senate.  \"I'll bet you wish you were in\u00a0those meetings and we have\u00a0worked together on many, many\u00a0issues and I admire both of\u00a0them,\" she said. \"I\u00a0have worked with Elizabeth on a\u00a0lot of the financial reforms and\u00a0have supported the work that she\u00a0has done there,\" Klobuchar said.\u00a0\"I have worked with Bernie\u00a0extensively on pharmaceutical\u00a0issues ... in\u00a0bringing in less expensive drugs\u00a0from other countries to bring\u00a0the prices down.\" But the Minnesota senator did draw a line, noting that she opposed \"Medicare for All.\"  \"I think it's better to build on\u00a0the Affordable Care Act with a\u00a0public option,\" Klobuchar said, referring to her own health care plan. Watch: ##Klobuchar## Tammie Green is an attorney and public defender who filed for bankruptcy after taking out public and private loans to pay for law school.  Green, who \"is drowning in student loan debt,\" asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar tonight during her town hall what help she would provide as president to her and many in her situation. One of the things Klobuchar discussed was the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and how it is \"messed up.\" \"It says if you stay in a certain\u00a0area that you can get your loans\u00a0paid back in ten years.\u00a0It is so messed up and I have\u00a0found 137 things that I can do\u00a0in the first hundred days of my\u00a0presidency without Congress that\u00a0are legal and one of things that\u00a0I would do in the first 100\u00a0seconds is fire Betsy DeVos,\" Klobuchar said. \"That would actually go a\u00a0long way toward what we need to\u00a0do which is making that program\u00a0work and actually phasing it in.\" The repayment program allows borrowers who work in the public sector, like teachers and social workers to apply for debt cancellation after making 10 years' worth of payments, was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007. But the first time anyone would have made enough payments to qualify was the fall of 2017, under the Trump administration. Congress set aside $700 million to\u00a0expand the program in 2018\u00a0to address the low number of people qualifying for forgiveness, but the new report shows that fix hasn't had the desired results. More on DeVos: DeVos and the Department of Education were held in civil contempt by a federal judge in late October and ordered to pay damages to student borrowers who took out loans to attend a now defunct for-profit college. The judge had previously ordered the Department of Education to stop collecting on the loans. In September, the department admitted that\u00a0more than 16,000 borrowers\u00a0were incorrectly informed that they owed a payment on their debt after the court order. About 1,800 had their wages garnished and more than 800 were mistakenly subject to adverse credit reporting. Under DeVos, the Department of Education has\u00a0scrapped a rule that was intended to protect students from for-profit colleges, and is rewriting a rule about how defrauded students can qualify for loan forgiveness. DeVos and the department have also been\u00a0sued\u00a0over the high rejection rate in a debt forgiveness program for public sector workers. Watch her comments: ##Klobuchar## Amy Klobuchar explained tonight what she was thinking in a photo showing her in the middle of a heated debate between Joe Biden and Tom Steyer. The moment happened on stage at the Democratic debate in South Carolina on Tuesday. Here's how she explained the moment:  \"That moment with those two, they were\u00a0going at it and I stood there. And what was somewhat amusing\u00a0about it was that Tom Steyer was\u00a0so heated he was moving into my\u00a0little area right there, and so\u00a0I actually thought he was\u00a0flailing his arms that I\u00a0actually might get hit in the\u00a0process and then I thought,\u00a0well, if something happens and I\u00a0fall off my little stool I was\u00a0standing on because I'm the only\u00a0one who is truly 5'4\" despite\u00a0the fact that the President\u00a0called Michael Bloomberg, 5'4\",\u00a0I'm the only one that can hold\u00a0that and I thought to myself, at\u00a0least Steyer has deep pockets.\u00a0I'll be in good shape.\u00a0I can get something out of this\u00a0and it will be okay.\" Klobuchar went on to describe the debate as a \"slug fest.\" Watch: ##Klobuchar## Amy Klobuchar, whose home state of Minnesota votes next week on Super Tuesday, wouldn\u2019t say whether she would drop out of the Democratic presidential race if she loses there.\u00a0 \u201cI never set litmus tests and I know I'm going to win Minnesota. That's not a factor,\u201d she said.\u00a0 She pointed to polls that show her narrowly ahead there.\u00a0 \u201cThe key part is not necessarily the primary. The key part is the general election,\u201d she said, pointing to President Donald Trump\u2019s frequent visits to Minnesota, a state Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016.\u00a0 See the moment: ##Klobuchar## Amy Klobuchar, pressed on why she focuses so intently on reaching out to Midwestern voters, said she actually defines the Midwest as \u201cthe states that feel that\u00a0they've been left behind some in\u00a0terms of focus in the 2016 election.\u201d Klobuchar said she \u201cwould include states like South\u00a0Carolina\u201d in that description. \u201cDo you worry that this messaging\u00a0isolates voters in other parts\u00a0of the country such as south\u00a0Carolina,\u201d asked a voter. \u201cHow do you appeal to non-Midwest\u00a0voters?\u00a0 \u201cI\u00a0really think about the Midwest\u00a0and the states that feel that\u00a0they've been left behind some in\u00a0terms of focus in the 2016 election where we\u00a0weren't able to turn out our\u00a0vote the way that we should,\u201d Klobuchar said.  \u201cI\u00a0would include states like South\u00a0Carolina, and my plan is\u00a0actually to build a beautiful\u00a0blue wall of Democratic votes in\u00a0this coalition of independents\u00a0and moderate Republicans around\u00a0states including states like\u00a0South Carolina, and make Donald\u00a0Trump pay for it.\u201d Klobuchar regularly touts connections to the Midwest, arguing her \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201cdetermination\u201d come from her upbringing in Minnesota. Watch: ##Klobuchar## When it comes to black voters in South Carolina, Sen. Amy Klobuchar believes she is the better choice for president when compared to former Vice President Joe Biden. Klobuchar cited support she has received in her home state of Minnesota. \"I've\u00a0always had strong support in the\u00a0African-American community in\u00a0all of my elections and I have a\u00a0number of leaders in the\u00a0African-American community in\u00a0Minnesota that are supporting me\u00a0not only through the years, but\u00a0in my presidential race.\u00a0So the way I earn the support is\u00a0with the agenda that I just\u00a0talked about and it is also\u00a0earning the hearts and minds of\u00a0people,\" Klobuchar said tonight during her town hall. Klobuchar added: \"I think there have been so many\u00a0broken promises to the\u00a0African-American community, and\u00a0I'm not that person. I think\u00a0some of my colleagues, I'm not\u00a0referring to the vice president\u00a0here, but some of my colleagues\u00a0up on that debate stage were\u00a0promising a lot of things that I\u00a0don't think they can deliver. I don't want to be that\u00a0person.\" Why this matters: The former vice president made no secret of his need for a big win Saturday to keep his presidential aspirations afloat.  During his town hall earlier tonight, Biden addressed South Carolina's kingmaker status when it comes to the White House.  \"You pick presidents, the\u00a0Democratic primary here in this\u00a0state, picks presidents,\" Biden said tonight. \"You're the reason why Bill\u00a0Clinton was elected president.\u00a0You're the reason Barack Obama\u00a0was elected president.\u00a0You represent the diversity of the population. Going into Super Tuesday, look, no Democrat has ever won the\u00a0presidency without overwhelming\u00a0support from number one, the\u00a0African-American community, the\u00a0most loyal support that exists\u00a0in the Democratic party, and I\u00a0do not take it for granted.\" Hear her response: ##Klobuchar## Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar laid out her plan tonight to combat the spread of coronavirus in the US if she's elected president. The Democratic senator said she would ensure the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is strong and that the US had \"adequate\u00a0medical help and research.\"  Klobuchar went on to say she would invest in education \"because the next vaccine or the\u00a0next cure or the next way that\u00a0we reduce the risk is probably\u00a0right now in a college student\u00a0at your college.\" Watch: ##Klobuchar## Amy Klobuchar took issue with the fact that President Trump tapped Vice President Mike Pence to lead his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus on Wednesday. \u201cUsually\u00a0you might put a medical\u00a0professional in charge,\u201d she said. \u201cI would hope that the vice\u00a0president will be working, I'm sure he will be, with the\u00a0agency heads at Health and Human\u00a0Services and at the CDC, and\u00a0sometimes you elevate things by\u00a0giving them to the vice\u00a0president.\u201d Trump, during a briefing on Wednesday afternoon, announced that Pence would lead the government\u2019s response to coronavirus as criticism of the White House\u2019s handling of the outbreak has grown. There have been more than 80,000 cases of coronavirus globally and the death toll has risen to more than 2,700, the majority in mainland China. The US has 60 confirmed cases, US health officials said Tuesday, a number that is expected to grow. Klobuchar also said she believes Congress has a role in the coronavirus response. \u201cI think we\u00a0want to make sure that\u00a0everything is done in the right\u00a0way and that's the job of\u00a0Congress to perform oversight,\u201d she said Hear Sen. Klobuchar's response: ##Klobuchar## Sen. Amy Klobuchar's town hall in South Carolina has now started. ##Klobuchar## Joe Biden spoke about the importance of South Carolina's primary and the role it has played in predicting past presidents.  The discussion was prompted by a question from David Caughran, a lawyer, who called South Carolina Biden's \"firewall state.\" \"Here's the deal.\u00a0You pick presidents, the\u00a0Democratic primary here in this\u00a0state, picks presidents,\" Biden said tonight during his town hall. \"You're the reason why Bill\u00a0Clinton was elected president.\u00a0You're the reason Barack Obama\u00a0was elected president.\u00a0You represent the diversity of the population. Going into Super Tuesday, look, no Democrat has ever won the\u00a0presidency without overwhelming\u00a0support from number one, the\u00a0African-American community, the\u00a0most loyal support that exists\u00a0in the Democratic party, and I\u00a0do not take it for granted.\" Why South Carolina is so crucial to Biden: He has always said the state would be key to his winning the nomination because the large number of black voters is more representative of the Democratic electorate.  The former vice president's campaign\u00a0recently redeployed resources to\u00a0South Carolina, placing a heavier concentration in the state as Biden tries to regain his footing in the 2020 race following a pair of less than stellar finishes in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Biden trails Sen. Bernie Sanders, the current front runner, in many national polls.  Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress and an influential figure in South Carolina politics, endorsed\u00a0Biden today. Clyburn's endorsement comes ahead of Saturday's\u00a0South Carolina\u00a0primary, where Biden needs a win in order to keep his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination alive. Watch the moment: ##Biden## Joe Biden thinks Bernie Sanders is \"a great guy\" and \"decent, honorable man who means what he says.\" But the former vice president said on Wednesday night that Sanders, as the Democratic nominee, would hurt the party's Senate candidates in red states. \"Ask yourself the question: You're running for the United States Senate in Georgia, where we can win, in North Carolina, here in (South Carolina), in Pennsylvania, in Arizona. Do you think it helps you or hurts you to have a self-proclaimed socialist at the top of the ticket?\" Biden said. \"That's not going at (Sanders') character,\" he added, \"that's going at his position.\" Biden then touted his role in 2018 campaigning for successful Democratic midterm candidates, noting that Sanders, who stumped for Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in Florida among others, was much less likely to be invited to do the same. See the moment: ##Biden## Joe Biden was asked to address the controversial confirmation of Clarence Thomas and the sexual harassment accusations made against the Supreme Court justice decades ago by Anita Hill. Claire Wofford, an associate professor at the College of Charleston, asked Biden to speak to \"female\u00a0voters who were and perhaps are\u00a0still unhappy with how\" Biden handled Thomas' confirmation. \"Well, by the way.\u00a0I opposed Thomas Clarence from\u00a0the beginning.\u00a0I believed Anita Hill from the\u00a0beginning.\u00a0And I tried to control the\u00a0questions under the laws that\u00a0exist for the Senate.\u00a0And I was unable to do it,\" Biden said. Biden claims that following Thomas' confirmation, he made a commitment to have women on the judiciary committee.  \"So I went out and I campaigned\u00a0for two people.\u00a0Carol Mosely Braun, an\u00a0African-American senator from\u00a0the state of Illinois, and\u00a0Dianne Feinstein from\u00a0California, on the condition\u00a0that if they won, they would\u00a0join the committee,\" Biden added.  Some more context: Biden oversaw Thomas' confirmation hearings in 1991, during which Hill testified that Thomas had sexually harassed her. In April 2019, Biden told ABC he believed Hill did not get a fair hearing and was not treated well, and\u00a0said\u00a0he took responsibility. Hill\u00a0told CNN in October that she's \"ready to hold\u00a0Biden\u00a0accountable\" for his role in leading the confirmation hearing. \"Have I forgiven Joe Biden? I'm ready to move on, but I am also ready to hold Joe Biden accountable. Accountability means acknowledging your role in a problem and the harm it's caused. Acknowledging that you have culpability,\" Hill told CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the CITIZEN by CNN conference in New York. Watch: ##Biden## Joe Biden marveled at a question about what would happen if President Trump loses the November election but refuses to concede, asking the audience if it ever would have thought \u201cany person would be able to ask that question and be taken seriously.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOur democracy is at risk,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 He said the way Trump has treated the military, the intelligence community and the FBI, \u201cI have no worry about him being escorted out of the White House.\u201d\u00a0 Biden spoke directly to Trump, saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about someone interfering in our election, why don\u2019t you do something about Russia now?\u201d Hear his response: ##Biden## Joe Biden emotionally reflected on the loss of his son Beau on Wednesday, connecting the death of his oldest son to brain cancer to the loss that Anthony Thompson experienced when his wife was killed in the 2015 Charleston church shooting. The answer showcased Biden\u2019s ability to connect with voters emotionally and the depth that he feels the loss of his son. \u201cI kind of\u00a0know what it's like to lose\u00a0family.\u00a0And my heart goes out to you,\u201d Biden said with tears in his eyes. Biden recalled how he came back to Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the site of the shooting that killed nine people in 2015, the Sunday after the shooting \u201cbecause\u00a0I had just lost my son and I wanted some hope.\u201d \u201cWhat you all did was astounding,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAll of those who died, were\u00a0killed by this white\u00a0supremacist, they forgave him.\u00a0They forgave him.\u00a0The ultimate act of Christian\u00a0charity.\u00a0They forgave him.\u201d Biden\u2019s life has been struck with tragedy repeatedly. Biden\u2019s son died in 2015 and his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972. \u201cI\u00a0don't know how you've dealt with\u00a0it, reverend, but the way I've\u00a0been able to deal with when my\u00a0wife was killed and my daughter\u00a0was killed and my son died, I've only been able to deal with\u00a0it by realizing they're part of\u00a0my being,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son, beau, was my soul.\u201d Biden has said his late son urged him to run before his death. \u201cEvery day I get\u00a0up, I literally\u2026 I ask\u00a0myself, I hope he's proud of me\u00a0today,\u201d Biden concluded. Watch the exchange: ##Biden## Joe Biden and CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo took the stage with ashes on their foreheads in observance of the Christian holy day of Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent.\u00a0 Biden walked onstage and pointed to his own forehead when he saw the ashes on Cuomo\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cYou know, when you\u00a0come out here, the makeup artist\u00a0put stuff on you, you know.\u00a0I said, 'Don't fool with the\u00a0ashes.\u00a0My mother will come down from\u00a0heaven and smite me,'\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd I know your mom, and I know\u00a0what she would do to you, too,\u201d Biden said to Cuomo. \u201cThis was not a planned deal,\u00a0but, you know, it's kind of a\u00a0Catholic thing.\u00a0Anyway\u201d Cuomo joked, \u201cIn the break, we'll bump\u00a0heads and nobody will know.\u201d See the moment: ##Biden## Bernie Sanders has been harshly critical of Joe Biden over his vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq. On Wednesday night, Biden said Sanders should be held to similar account for his own votes against the Brady Bill and support for legislation that shields gun manufacturers from lawsuits. Both men have since admitted they regretted their votes.\u00a0 \u201cThe idea here is,\ufffd\ufffd Biden said, \u201cwhat is\u00a0the thing that motivates you to\u00a0make your judgments?\u201d Sanders has \u201cgone after every corporation in the world, which is -- I don't disagree on all of it with him, but I've not seen him go after the gun manufacturers,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd so here's the deal. What are you going to do about it now?\u201d Sanders is currently backs a bill that would reverse the current law and open up the firearm industry to lawsuits. \u00a0 Biden also accused Sanders of glossing over his record on the question of an assault weapons ban, saying that Sanders backed it in 1988, when he ran for and lost his first House race, then backed off the position when he won two years later. Sanders supported the assault weapons ban, but enjoyed some NRA support in 1990 because of his opposition to the handgun bill. Hear Former VP Biden's comments: ##Biden## Joe Biden faulted President Trump for cutting funding for the National Institutes of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, contrasting the Obama administration\u2019s ramped-up efforts against Ebola to the Trump administration\u2019s handling of coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve got good scientists and I just want the President to get on the same page as the scientists,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 He said Trump should have pushed more aggressively for American scientists to be on the ground in China to study the outbreak and help prevent it from spreading.\u00a0 \u201cWe should be allowed to do that and they should want us to do that because we have genuine experts who know how to confront these things,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 Watch the moment: ##Biden## Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken the stage at a CNN town hall event in South Carolina, just three days before the state's primary. ##Biden## Mike Bloomberg -- who has identified as a Democrat, a Republican and an independent throughout his political career -- defended his Democratic credentials on Wednesday. \u201cI come from Massachusetts\u00a0where there are no Republicans,\u00a0so I was a Democrat there for\u00a0sure.\u00a0I moved to New York City, where\u00a0there are no Republicans, so I\u00a0was a Democrat there,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cIt is true I ran as a\u00a0Republican twice and an\u00a0independent once because the\u00a0Democratic Party wouldn't let me\u00a0go out and get on the ballot.\u201d Bloomberg went on to say that he spoke in favor of Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden both in 2008 and 2012. \u201cHe says \u2018No,\u2019 \" Bloomberg said of Biden, who he is now running against, \u201cbut I was there\u00a0both times for them, thank you\u00a0very much.\u201d Some Democrats, including former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have used the fact that Bloomberg used to be a Republican against him. See the moment: ##Bloomberg## Michael Bloomberg stuck by his comment in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate that Chinese leader Xi Jinping is not a dictator.\u00a0 \u201cI think the question is, if your definition is a democracy where people vote and pick their leaders, that is not what China\u2019s about and they don\u2019t seem to want it. They like their system, and I think they\u2019re wrong \u2014 I think they\u2019d be better opening things up, having freedom of the press which they don\u2019t have,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cWe should work as hard as we can to change that, but you\u2019re not going to try to go to war and force them,\u201d Bloomberg added.\u00a0 He said: \u201cWe should get used to the fact that China is going to keep growing and become stronger, and we have to figure out a ways to work with them while protecting our industries and protecting our country militarily.\u201d\u00a0 Hear his response: ##Bloomberg## Michael Bloomberg touted his record as mayor of New York City, lobbying the state legislature to legalize same-sex marriage and improving schools there, when asked how he\u2019d bring a divided Democratic Party together.\u00a0 \u201cPulling people together, making them feel that they\u2019re part of the solution, is what management is all about,\u201d Bloomberg said.\u00a0 He said he pushed Republican state senators to legalize same-sex marriage by encouraging them to consider what they\u2019d want for their own children.\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to say no. It\u2019s your child,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might not be thrilled about it, but in the end you want to give your child what that child wants.\u201d\u00a0 He also said he shakes the hands of doormen when he enters buildings.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just a ways of giving people recognition and respect,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Watch: ##Bloomberg## Bernie Sanders has been a relentless critic of Michael Bloomberg, accusing him of trying to buy the nomination and railing against the former New York mayor as the embodiment of a rising oligarchy in America. Still, Bloomberg said on Wednesday night he will support Sanders if he wins the primary. And spend to help him, despite signals from Sanders' campaign that they don't want his help. \"I always thought it's\u00a0ridiculous to say I will support\u00a0the candidate no matter who it\u00a0is, because you might not agree\u00a0with him,\" Bloomberg said.\u00a0\"That's how we got Donald Trump.\u00a0The (Republican) party supported him no\u00a0matter how bad he was.\u00a0They shouldn't have done that.\" But for Democrats, Bloomberg added, it was different. \"It's easy to make the commitment\u00a0to support any of the Democratic\u00a0candidates if they get the\u00a0nomination,\" he said. \"It's easy to do it because\u00a0the alternative is Donald Trump,\u00a0and that we don't want.\" He also promised, again, to keep his campaign offices open after the primary, even if he loses it. \"Whoever is the nominee can\u00a0use those,\" Bloomberg said.\u00a0 Asked how much he would spend to help the eventual winner, Bloomberg didn't offer a specific figure. \"I haven't thought about that,\" he said, \"because I plan to be the nominee\u00a0obviously.\"\u00a0 See the moment: ##Bloomberg## Mike Bloomberg sought to explain his record on stop-and-frisk on Wednesday and delivered possibly the most fulsome apology he has made as a presidential candidate about the policing policy. \u201cWe just did it much too much and\u00a0an awful lot of innocent people\u00a0got stopped who didn't have\u00a0guns.\u00a0And it was my mistake, and I\u00a0apologized for it.\u201d Bloomberg said.  \u201cI've asked for forgiveness.\u00a0But I can't rewrite history and\u00a0I've got to make sure we don't\u00a0do it in the future.\u00a0And hopefully my successor has\u00a0learned the lesson from my\u00a0mistake.\u201d Why this matters: Bloomberg\u2019s mass implementation of stop and frisk has loomed over his campaign ever since he entered the race in November. Issues of criminal justice have been central to the Democratic debate, and Bloomberg\u2019s record has raised many questions about how the mayor will be able to win over black and Latino voters given how stop-and-frisk overwhelmingly targeted minority New Yorkers. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, more than 5 million stop-and-frisk stops were made during Bloomberg's 12 years in office, with nearly 686,000 stops in 2011 being the high point during his tenure. Blacks and Latinos accounted for more than 50% of the stops in 70 out of 76 New York precincts. Bloomberg, however, also left out key parts of his record of stop and frisk policy in his answer. Bloomberg claimed that he \u201cstopped the process, cut 95%\u201d of stop and frisks. Bloomberg is correct that there was a reduction of stop and frisk searches by about 95% during Bloomberg\u2019s time as mayor. But that only came in the last two years of Bloomberg\u2019s time as mayor and after he had presided over a six-fold increase in the number of stops during his first decade in office. Hear Bloomberg's comments: ##Bloomberg## Michael Bloomberg, discussing causes of gun violence, said \u201cwe have a mental health problem in the country\u201d and that all insurance plans should cover mental health services.\u00a0 But, he said, it\u2019s not enough to make up for guns being in one in four households.\u00a0 \u201cThe real answer is to just get the guns off the streets. What has happened in America in the last decade or so, the gun manufacturers have been working 24/7 making guns and selling them,\u201d Bloomberg said.\u00a0 Watch: ##Bloomberg## Michael Bloomberg slammed Bernie Sanders for his votes on gun control legislation, saying of Sanders' past opposition to the Brady Bill, \"If that isn't being in NRA's\u00a0pocket, I don't know what is.\" \"He voted against background\u00a0checks five times in a row,\" Bloomberg said. \"He also voted against the bill\u00a0that gives gun manufacturers\u00a0protections against you suing\u00a0them for misuse of their\u00a0product.\u00a0It's the only industry in\u00a0America that is protected, the\u00a0only one.\" Asked about Sanders evolution into being a vocal opponent of the NRA and proponent of new gun control measures, Bloomberg gave Sanders credit. \"I hope he changed his mind.\u00a0I don't wish him ill.\u00a0If he changed his mind to do the\u00a0right thing, that's good,\" Bloomberg said.  \"Look, people make mistakes and\u00a0if you fix them, that's better\u00a0than if you don't fix them.\u00a0It would be better off if you\u00a0hadn't made them in the\u00a0beginning.\" Hear his response: ##Bloomberg## Michael Bloomberg said he does not have confidence in the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper said, \u201cWe just heard from the\u00a0President.\u00a0He said that the US is very, very ready for\u00a0this, talking about the\u00a0coronavirus.\u00a0They've done a great job, he said, keeping\u00a0it at a minimum in the United\u00a0States and he's putting Vice\u00a0President Pence in charge of the\u00a0effort.\u201d Cooper continued, \u201cDo you have confidence in this\u00a0administration to handle a\u00a0potential pandemic?\u00a0What would you do differently?\u201d \u201cI feel so much better,\u201d Bloomberg said sarcastically.  \u201cNo,\" he added.  \u201cNo. 1, he fired the pandemic team two years ago,\u201d Bloomberg continued. \u201cNo. 2, he's been defunding\u00a0Centers for Disease Control, so\u00a0we don't have the experts in\u00a0place that we need.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is we are\u00a0not ready for this kind of\u00a0thing,\u201d Bloomberg said.\u00a0 Bloomberg said he handled several crises as mayor, including Hurricane Sandy, the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the swine flu.\u00a0 \u201cWe were ready\u00a0for it in the sense that we had\u00a0played out what would happen,\u00a0how we would communicate with\u00a0people, how we would distribute\u00a0drugs, how we would include the\u00a0hospitals and nurses and what do\u00a0you do about the seniors homes\u00a0and people with special needs\u00a0and that sort of thing,\u201d Bloomberg said. Earlier today: Bloomberg's campaign put out a new ad called \"Pandemic,\" highlighting reports that the US isn't prepared for the coronavirus and promoting Bloomberg's record on managing crisis situations and funding research to fight pandemics.
