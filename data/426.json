Three sources involved in the negotiations said that the details over how to spend billions over testing for Covid-19 remains unresolved in the talks over the massive relief bill under negotiation by top congressional leaders and the White House.  The measure will include hundreds of billions of dollars for the new small business loan program, Payroll Protection Program. Democrats and Republicans have different visions over a testing policy, one of the sources said. President Trump has increasingly said that testing needs to be done by the states, while Democrats have called for a testing program led by the federal government. As part of the deal to replenish the small business loan program, the two sides had agreed to $25 billion for testing.\u00a0 But the details are more complicated to sort out. It appears increasingly likely that talks will extend into tomorrow, but they are still negotiating tonight, the sources said. ##Health## US President Donald Trump on Sunday called people who are protesting their governors\u2019 social distancing measures \u201cgreat people.\u201d Trump said this despite the fact the states are following recommendations of federal health officials to institute the distancing guidelines. In recent days Trump has encouraged governors to relax those guidelines as soon as they feel it\u2019s safe to do so. Trump was asked on Sunday if he is worried that his tweets about liberating Kentucky, Michigan and Virginia are in any way helping to incite potential violence, as some governors have reportedly received death threats. Trump responded: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the people. I\u2019ve seen\u00a0interviews of the people.\u00a0These are great people.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He added that they have cabin fever and they want their lives back.\u00a0 \u201cTheir life was taken away from them,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people love our country, they want to get back to work.\u201d ##Daily Life## United States President Donald Trump has called the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's early work a \"mess\" -- but said things had improved. \u201cCDC had obsolete tests, old tests, broken tests and a mess,\u201d said Trump at a White House news briefing on Sunday. He was responding to a question about failures in testing at the CDC.  Multiple health officials told CNN this weekend that contamination in manufacturing at the CDC caused weeks of delays that slowed the US response to the coronavirus pandemic. The problem stemmed in part from the CDC not adhering to its own protocols, a Food and Drug Administration spokesperson said on Saturday. But things have since improved, Trump said. \u201c(The CDC) has done a very good job, and they've done it under pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure is -- they had to do this under pressure so we're very proud of the job they've done.\u201d Without citing evidence, however, Trump blamed prior administrations for the CDC\u2019s early failures during the pandemic. \u201cI told you we inherited a lot of garbage, we took, they had tests that were no good, they had all this stuff was no good,\u201d said Trump, who has been President for three and a half years.  ##Health## Iran reported 87 more coronavirus-related fatalities on Sunday, bringing the nationwide total to 5,118 deaths, according to the Iranian Health Ministry. Over the past 24 hours, 1,343 new cases have tested positive in the country, which brings the total number of reported infections in Iran to 82,211. As the coronavirus numbers slowly decline, the Iranian government is considering taking steps to reopen their economy in the coming weeks. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani urged Iranians to continue social distancing and abide by the recommendations of the health ministry on Saturday, according to the Iranian News Agency report. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro joined a rally in the country's capital on Sunday, where protesters called for an end to quarantine measures and some urged military intervention to shut down Congress and the Supreme Court. Congress and the Supreme Court have supported social isolation measures imposed by governors. The President didn\u2019t wear a mask and coughed several times while speaking to the crowd of a couple\u00a0of\u00a0hundred\u00a0supporters in Brasilia. \u201c(Everyone must) do whatever is necessary for the country to have the prominent place it deserves,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe will not negotiate anything.\u201d The rules in Brazil: National and local governments in the country have issued mixed messaging on how to behave during the pandemic. While Bolsonaro has been pushing against strict restrictions, state and local governments in some of Brazil's hardest-hit areas have closed schools and all but essential businesses, with firefighters and police in the streets urging people to stay indoors. Last week, Bolsonaro fired his health minister after weeks of clashes over social isolation measures. During a news conference to introduce his new minister, he reiterated that businesses need to be reopened to ensure that the economic fallout isn\u2019t worse than the virus. Polls, however, show that a majority of Brazilians support social isolation. On Sunday, Bolsonaro's supporters also organized caravans in different cities. The background: Brazil has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in Latin America. As of Sunday, the country had reported 38,654 cases and 2,462 deaths, according to health officials. ##Daily Life## President Donald Trump admitted Sunday that he excluded Sen. Mitt Romney from the bipartisan congressional task force focused on reopening the country because he maintains a grudge against Romney who voted in favor of Trump\u2019s impeachment. When asked at Sunday\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing if the decision to shut Romney out of the task force shows that he still holds a grudge against Romney, the only Republican senator left off the congressional task force, Trump said yes. \u201cYeah it does. I\u2019m not a fan of Mitt Romney at all,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Mitt Romney, I don\u2019t want his advice.\u201d Romney voted to convict Trump on the first article of impeachment -- abuse of power. Romney was the only Republican Party senator to vote in favor of either articles of impeachment. Seema Verma, administrator for The Centers for\u00a0Medicare\u00a0and Medicaid Services, has announced that nursing homes will be required to report to patients, their families and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) when they have any coronavirus cases. Verma added that the government will be paying labs to go to nursing homes to collect samples. \"It's important that patients and\u00a0their families have the\u00a0information that they need, and\u00a0they need to understand what's\u00a0going on in the nursing home,\" Verma said. \"This will support CDC's efforts\u00a0to have surveillance around the\u00a0country and contact tracing so\u00a0we can mitigate the spread of\u00a0the virus in the communities\u00a0that show spread starting in the nursing homes.\" Hospitals that want to move toward reopening for elective surgeries and other non-covid medical procedures still need to be able to handle potential surges from coronavirus infections, according to new guidelines announced Sunday by Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Verma said that since some hospitals said they have unused capacity, the new guidelines will be folded into phase one of reopening the US. \u201cEvery state and local official has to assess the situation on the ground. They need to make sure they can still address surges, they need to make sure that they have adequate supplies and a plan for conserving supplies. They need to be able to screen patients and healthcare workers for Covid virus. And they need to make sure that patients feel safe when they come in to seek healthcare services by assuring that they have the appropriate cleaning in place and they observe social distancing inside the facilities,\u201d Verma said. Verma said that this will be a \u201cgradual process\u201d and that \u201chealth care officials across the country and health care systems need to decide what services should be made available, and ultimately doctors and patients need to make decisions about their health care services.\u201d When pressed by CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond as to why he was taking time during the daily coronavirus task force briefing to discuss praise he has received while more than 22 million Americans are currently unemployed and more than 40,000 people have died from coronavirus, Trump said he was \u201cstanding up for the men and women who have done such an incredible job,\u201d not for himself. \u201cI'm sticking up for those people,\" Trump said. \"I am also sticking up for doctors and nurses and military doctors and nurses.\u201d When further pressed by Diamond, Trump said \u201cthose people have been excoriated by the fake news.\u201d \u201cIt's not about me. Nothing is about me,\" he said. \"You are never going to treat me fairly, many of you, and I understand that.\u201d The clips Trump played at the briefing praised himself and not health care workers. President Trump announced Sunday that he will compel a US company to make swabs under the Defense Production Act. Two people familiar with the decision told CNN\u00a0that company is Puritan Medical Products, which is based in Maine. It\u00a0is known for making \"flocked swabs,\" which it says are better at collecting specimens than other types. Trump said the administration had experienced \"difficulty\" with the company, but did not elaborate further. Puritan did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. \"We\u2019ve had a little difficulty with one so we'll call in -- as we have in the past as you know -- we are calling in the Defense Production Act and we'll be getting swabs very easily,\u201d Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday that the\u00a0White House task force\u00a0overseeing the coronavirus pandemic believes several\u00a0large metro areas continue to stabilize and see progress.\u00a0He also said there are several cities the task force is watching. \u201cAreas that we continue to watch carefully on the task force include the Chicago metro area, Boston metro, and the Philadelphia metropolitan area,\u201d Pence said. As for the areas that have made progress he listed several: \u201cThe New York metro area, including New Jersey, New York, Long Island, Connecticut and Rhode Island all appear to be past their peak. The Detroit metro area also appears to be past its peak and is stable, New Orleans metro area actually is the most stable of all areas where we had a major metropolitan outbreak. The Denver metro area is stable,\u201d Pence said. The rates of California and\u00a0Washington states remain \u201clow and steady,\" Pence said  Chile has reported 10,088 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus, Paula Daza, Chile\u2019s public health undersecretary, said in a televised statement\u00a0on Sunday.\u00a0 In the past 24 hours, 358\u00a0new cases and seven new deaths have been recorded, according to Daza.  As of Sunday, there have been 133 coronavirus deaths in Chile.\u00a0 President Donald Trump said Sunday the US still wants investigators to go to China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak. The US has previously made requests, which have been rebuffed. The White House has continually accused China of withholding accurate information about the extent of the virus within the country. \u201cWe are talking to China. We spoke to them a long time ago about going in. We want to go in,\u201d Trump said Sunday at a coronavirus task force briefing. About 14% of the New York Police Department were out sick on Sunday -- that\u2019s down from a high of 19.8%, according to a daily NYPD report. To date, 4,371 members of the NYPD have tested positive for Covid-19. Of those, 2,270 members have recovered and returned to work, and 2,073 are still out sick, the report said. Those out sick include 1,706 uniformed members and 367 civilian members. President Donald Trump said he is planning to use the Defense Production Act again, this time to help with the production of swabs needed to conduct coronavirus tests. Trump said the administration is close to finalizing a deal with a company that will convert its plant to produce 10 million swabs per month, but that he would use the DPA to force another company to do the same. \u201cWe also are going to be using\u00a0and preparing to use the Defense\u00a0Production Act to increase swab\u00a0production in one US facility\u00a0by over 20 million additional swabs\u00a0per month.\u00a0We\u2019ve had a little difficulty with\u00a0one so we'll call in -- as we have\u00a0in the past, as you know -- we are calling in\u00a0the Defense Production Act and\u00a0we'll be getting swabs very easily,\u201d Trump said. Trump did not name either company. Governors on both sides of the aisle have complained that one of the reasons states cannot conduct enough coronavirus tests is that they lack the materials needed to conduct such tests, including swabs. Trump said last week 5 million swabs were going to be sent to the states but did not provide specifics. President Donald Trump opened Sunday\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing by saying negotiations over adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the Paycheck Protection Program are continuing to make progress, and that a deal could be announced Monday. Trump said he thinks the sides are getting close to a deal. \u201cI would like to begin by saying we are continuing to negotiate with the Democrats to get our great workers and small businesses all over the country taken care of. I think we are getting close to a deal. It could happen. It could happen. A lot of good work has been going on and we could have an answer tomorrow and we are going to see what exactly does take place,\u201d Trump said. The President also said there will additional aid in the package. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d earlier Sunday that $75 billion will be included for hospitals. \u201cWe are also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals who have been hurt very badly. The rural hospitals for a long time have not been treated properly. We are looking to help them and beyond. So we are looking at hospitals also as part of the package\u201d Trump said. Trump said he had just gotten off the phone with Mnuchin and concluded by saying, \u201cI think you will have a nice answer tomorrow.\u201d About 12,000 coronavirus testing kits distributed by the Washington Department of Health have been recalled because of possible contamination, according to a news release from the health department. Friday, University of Washington Medicine notified the state health department that there may have been a quality control issue after a\u00a0small number of vials of viral transport media (VTM) fluid appeared to have an unusual color, according to the release. The testing kits in question were sent to local health jurisdictions, tribal nations, and state agency partners across the state, the news release said. Jurisdictions that received the kits are encouraged to contact the health department for a new shipment of swabs and VTM transport tubes, according to the release. A large shipment of swabs and VTM from a different vendor are expected to arrive in the state this week, the release said.\u00a0 There are at least\u00a0755,533\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the United States and at least\u00a040,461 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0\u00a0 View CNN's interactive map tracking the coronavirus in the United States.  Illinois\u00a0Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that while the state has machines to complete coronavirus testing, it doesn't have all of the resources needed to analyze all tests on a larger scale. Testing kits are available and machines are available, but there are key components needed to analyze all collected samples, Pritzker said.\u00a0 Such components include swabs, viral transport mechanisms to send swabs for testing,\u00a0reagents, RNA extractors and available lab technicians to complete testings, according to Pritzker. A total of 995 patients have been treated at the Javits Convention Center field hospital in New York since it opened\u00a0at the end of March, according to Northwell Health spokesman Terry Lynam. Of those 995 patients, 254 remain hospitalized, Lynam said. About 172 patients have been treated on the USNS Comfort since the ship arrived in New York Harbor\u00a0on March 30, Lynam said, and\u00a063 patients remain on board. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to work better with the New York Police Department on social distancing and monitoring the number of people that can be on each car. His comments Sunday came after he was asked about some city council members urging the governor to shut down the subways to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 The mayor also said he doesn\u2019t know another way people could get around if trains were shut down. MTA spokesman Shams Tarek released a statement Sunday saying \"even with subway ridership down more than 90 percent, we are making it possible for doctors, nurses, first responders, grocery and pharmacy workers, and other essential personnel to get to work and save lives.\" Shutting down mass transit during this unprecedented crisis would be dangerous and could lead to even more deaths.\"  Tarek also said \"MTA has led the nation in its efforts to protect its employees and customers, disinfecting its stations and full fleet of rolling stock and even breaking away from federal guidance and providing hundreds of thousands of masks to our heroic workforce before the CDC recommended it.\u201d A\u00a0UK\u00a0government\u00a0spokesman has refuted wide-ranging claims made by The Sunday Times in a\u00a0damning article that criticizes the\u00a0government\u2019s early response to the coronavirus pandemic, arguing Sunday that the article contains a \u201cseries of falsehoods\" that \"misrepresent\" the\u00a0government's actions. This article contains a series of falsehoods and errors and actively misrepresents the enormous amount of work which was going on in\u00a0government\u00a0at the earliest stages of the coronavirus outbreak,\" the\u00a0government\u2019s spokesman\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0 \"The Prime Minister has been at the helm of the response to this, providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation,\" the statement added.\u00a0 The\u00a0spokesman\u2019s response comes after Cabinet minister Michael Gove acknowledged\u00a0that -- as reported by the Sunday Times -- Prime\u00a0Minister\u00a0Boris Johnson did not attend five national security COBR meetings focused on\u00a0coronavirus in January and February. According to the\u00a0government\u2019s spokesman, it is \"entirely normal and proper\" for such meetings to be\u00a0chaired by the\u00a0relevant secretary of state, as opposed to the Prime Minister.\u00a0 \u201cIt is ridiculous to suggest that coronavirus only reached the\u00a0UK\u00a0because the Health Secretary and not the PM chaired a COBR meeting,\u201d the spokesman said.\u00a0 Additionally, The Sunday Times reported that a number of opportunities to reduce the impact of the pandemic had been missed by the\u00a0UK\u00a0government\u00a0in January, February and March, claiming that\u00a0UK\u00a0officials \"sleepwalked into disaster\" and \"played down the looming threat\" of\u00a0coronavirus.\u00a0 The\u00a0government\u2019s spokesman rejected such claims, asserting the\u00a0government\u00a0\"started to act as soon as it was alerted to a potential outbreak\" of coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cThe suggestion that the\u00a0government\u2019s attitude was nonchalant is wrong. Extensive and detailed work was going on in\u00a0government\u00a0because of coronavirus,\" the spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The\u00a0government\u2019s scientific advisory groups started to meet in mid-January and (Health Secretary Matt) Hancock instituted daily meetings to grip the emerging threat. We have taken the right steps at the right time guided by the scientific evidence,\" the spokesman added.\u00a0 The United States now has at least 40,585 reported coronavirus deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. There are at least 742,442 cases of the virus in the US, according to the university. Tyson Foods says it is following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Agriculture and health departments after some of its team members tested positive for coronavirus.  Earlier today, CNN reported that 90 plant workers in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, tested positive for coronavirus, but there have been no deaths Tyson Foods Senior Vice President Hector Gonzalez said in a video statement that the company is requiring workers to take their temperatures at the start of each shift and wear face coverings. The company has also expanded work spaces by erecting tents.\u00a0 \u201cWe're extremely grateful for the work our team members are doing and for the role they play in the critical supply chain that extends from farm to fork,\u201d Gonzalez said. Tyson Foods spokesperson Worth Sparkman said in a statement the company is also sanitizing plant production areas and has deep cleaned other areas of the facility, including employee break rooms and locker rooms. \"We have team members dedicated to constantly wiping down and sanitizing common areas. In\u00a0some\u00a0cases, this additional cleaning involves suspending a day of production,\" Sparkman said. According to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the US, there are at least\u00a0742,442\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the country and at least\u00a039,291\u00a0people have died from the disease. The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0 More than 100,000 people defied Bangladesh's lockdown order on Saturday to attend the funeral of\u00a0a senior leader of the\u00a0Islamist party in the district of Brahmanbaria, according to the prime minister's special assistant, Shah Ali Farhad,\u00a0and the\u00a0Brahmanbaria police spokesperson\u00a0Imtiaz Ahmed.\u00a0 The funeral for\u00a0Maulana Zubayer Ahmad Ansari, an Islamic teacher,\u00a0broke the country's ban of no more than five people attending prayers at one time, sparking fears of a new coronavirus outbreak emerging from the event.\u00a0 Tens of thousands of people flooded the roads to\u00a0Brahmanbaria district, walking from the surrounding areas to\u00a0attend the funeral, according to\u00a0Mohammad Mamunul Haque, the joint secretary general of the Islamist party.\u00a0 The police were unable to control the crowd, resulting in the officer in charge and assistant superintendent being withdrawn from the event and a \"three-member probe committee\" being formed to start an investigation into the congregation activity, according to Sohel Rana, the Bangladesh Police Central spokesperson. Bangladesh has a recorded total of 2,456 positive cases of coronavirus, with 91 deaths as of Sunday, though critics say the true number is higher and still unknown due to lack of testing kits.\u00a0 The coronavirus outbreak in Austria in \"under control,\" Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Sunday, crediting the positive development as a result of the government's early implementation of strict containment measures.\u00a0 \"We were one of the first countries in Europe which decided to have a complete lockdown, and I think it was extremely important that we were faster than others and our reaction was tougher than in other countries,\" Kurz told CNN. \"It was good that we did it because now the situation in Austria is under control. We only have about 100 new infections every day,\" he added.\u00a0 According to the Austrian leader, the number of new in-country coronavirus cases continues to go down, prompting the government to look towards a gradual relaxation of the nationwide lockdown.\u00a0 \"What we are trying is to re-open very slowly and very carefully. We are doing this step-by-step, always with two weeks in between,\" Kurz said.\u00a0\"It is important that we always have two weeks in between, which gives us the opportunity to watch the numbers very carefully and slow down our re-opening plan and, if necessary, pull the emergency brake.\" Kurz outlined that the government expects to allow small shops to open on Monday, extending to all shops by May 1; by mid-May, the government will look to extend this measure further to include restaurants, he added.\u00a0 \"Of course, we will still have restrictions like social distancing\u2026people in shops and also, in the future, people in restaurants and elsewhere will have to wear masks,\" Kurz said.\u00a0 Cuba has reported 1,035 confirmed cases of coronavirus,\u00a0according to\u00a0health officials on Sunday.  This is\u00a0the first time the total number of infected people has topped 1,000 on the island.\u00a0 Cuba has enacted some of the region\u2019s toughest restrictions as officials combat the spread of the disease, suspending nearly all domestic and international travel.\u00a0Citizens who return from abroad are required to spend 14 days at government isolation facilities and anyone suspected of having coronavirus must immediately go to hospital for treatment. The\u00a0economic impacts of the pandemic have led to longer lines for food and other basic items, complicating efforts to stem the spread of the infection.\u00a0 As of Sunday, the death toll stands at\u00a034, according to\u00a0Dr. Francisco Dur\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, Cuba\u2019s\u00a0national director of Epidemiology at the Ministry of Public Health.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she could back a proposal from other Democratic congressional leaders to allow proxy voting during the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 a possible solution to the logistical issues facing members of Congress as they attempt to navigate the challenge of working on complex legislation from afar.\u00a0 Pelosi said on Fox today that relevant committee chairs had arrived at the idea of proxy voting after she tasked them with considering ways to keep up with House business while members adhered to federal guidelines recommending against travel and gathering in groups. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a news conference today that even though the number of coronavirus cases is growing, the state has less people in the hospital and less people using ventilators.  He also said the number of deaths \u201cis a lagging indicator\u201d and \u201cit still appears that we are trending in a good direction and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d The state reported 348 new cases of Covid-19 which brings the total to 23,928. There were 29 new deaths which brings the total number of deaths in Louisiana to 1,296, Edwards said. \u201cNow the number of cases and the number of deaths are lower than they have been for the last number of days, that\u2019s a good thing, but I would caution everybody that typically on Sunday the numbers go down,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a function of when the labs report and so forth, so what we would like to see is a continued downward trajectory tomorrow and Tuesday and on through the week.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in much, much better place today than we thought we were going to be,\u201d Edwards said, adding that Louisiana citizens are taking the stay at home order seriously and sticking to social distancing guidelines. Edwards doesn\u2019t think life will go back to normal until there is a vaccine for coronavirus, but they will take some steps in the meantime. \u201cAs always, I want to remind everyone that it\u2019s going to take all of us working together and for some period of time to defeat this virus, get back to life as normal,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see that for a while and I suspect we won\u2019t fully see it until after there\u2019s a vaccine that\u2019s administered to the entire population.\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the number of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations is \"purely contingent on what we do\" and reopening the economy too quickly without a specific plan could cause the numbers to increase again. \"If we went through this, and\u00a0lost all of these people and\u00a0forced the essential workers and\u00a0the hospital workers to do\u00a0unbelievable tasks to get us\u00a0through this crisis, and we\u00a0recreate the crisis, then shame\u00a0on us,\" Cuomo said at a news conference today. \"We can control the beast.\u00a0Yes, but the beast is still\u00a0alive.\u00a0We did not kill the beast \u2013\u2013 and the beast can rise up again,\" Cuomo added. On antibody testing: Cuomo said said the FDA has approved the state's antibody tests. \u201cNow that we have the approved test we\u2019re going to be rolling it out to do the largest survey of any state population that has been done,\u201d he said. Cuomo said the state can conduct 2,000 antibody tests per\u00a0day, or about 14,000 per week. He mentioned that while this sounds like a large number, it is only a small percentage of New York's population of more than 19 million people. Cuomo said this is the first real statistical number on exactly \u201cwhere we are as a population,\u201d and will provide a true \u201cbaseline.\u201d \u201cWe have not had hard data on where we are,\" Cuomo said. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer responded to criticism about how detailed and specific the state's stay-home orders. \"You know my stay-home order is one of the nation's more conservative, but the fact of the matter is, it's working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten. And that means we're saving lives,\" Whitmer told CNN today. \"Who among us wouldn\u2019t rather forgo jet skiing or boating right now if its going to save your grandparent or your neighbors life and that\u2019s precisely what the tradeoff is at the moment.\" The democratic governor extended Michigan\u2019s stay-home order through April 30. The stringent order includes restrictions like prohibiting most people from traveling between residences unless they're taking care of a relative or dropping off a child. When asked whether Michigan has enough tests, Whitmer said, \u201cgovernors are doing the best we can with what we got. We could use some assistance to make sure the supply chain issues are addressed and we can do the robust testing that every epidemiologist in our country tells you is essential as we prepare to think about reengaging sectors of our economy.\u201d Some context: Whitmer said Michigan has the third\u00a0highest death count in the country and is the 10th\u00a0largest state, she told CNN. \u201cThis means we have a uniquely hard issue here because it\u2019s disproportionately hurting our state and that\u2019s why we need to take a uniquely aggressive action to protect people,\" she said. New York state will undertake the \u201cmost aggressive\u201d statewide antibody testing survey in the nation over the next week, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo said they will sample thousands of people across the state to find out if they have antibodies. \u201cThat will tell us for the first time what percent of the population actually has had the coronavirus and is now at least short term immune to the virus,\" he said. \u201cThis will be the first true snapshot of what we\u2019re really dealing with,\" Cuomo added. The New York State Department of Health will be running the tests over the next week. The state will have to work with the White House to assist with the supply chain and coordinate private labs, Cuomo said. ##Health## Gov. Andrew Cuomo said \"this is only halftime\" in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic in New York. The governor said at his daily press conference today that the battle has not been won yet and any plan to reopen the economy has to be based on data and testing. Cuomo said New York needs to learn from this experience and focus on rebuilding. \"Let's take these lessons forward\u00a0and how do we build back better\u00a0than before,\" Cuomo said. \"We have to open for a better\u00a0future than we have ever had.\u00a0We have to learn from this.\" Cuomo said the second phase of the state's plan to reopen the economy will require New Yorkers to do no harm, be smarter and develop new testing and learn the lessons to build back better. Cuomo also thanked the 95,000 medical professionals from inside and outside the state that have helped with coronavirus response efforts, saying it reminds him of the help the state received after 9/11. He said just as it did then, the support gives us \u201cconfidence\u201d that \u201cwere not in it alone.\u201d Cuomo has spoken to Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and told him that if they have to scramble, New York is going to \u201cbe there for you.\u201d New York has identified 400 ventilators to bring over to Massachusetts \u201con 24 hours notice\u201d should they need it, Cuomo said. There are 507 New Yorkers who have died due to coronavirus across the state over the past 24 hours, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Nursing homes continue to be a source of \"really disturbing situations,\" Cuomo said today during a news conference. \u00a0 \"The worst news for us to\u00a0live with every day, and an\u00a0everyday tragedy, we lost\u00a0another 507 New Yorkers.\u00a0Those are not just very large\u00a0numbers we see.\u00a0That's every number is a face\u00a0and a family and a brother and a\u00a0sister and mother and a father\u00a0and people who are in pain today\u00a0and will be in pain for a long\u00a0period of time.\u00a0So we remember them in our\u00a0thoughts and prayers,\" Cuomo said. At least 540 people\u00a0died\u00a0Friday in New York, the governor said as a news conference yesterday. Speaking today at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo shared Sunday that hospitalizations across the state are on the decline. \"The total hospitalization rate\u00a0is down again in the state of\u00a0New York.\u00a0We're down to 16,000.\u00a0If you look at the numbers,\u00a0we're at 18,000 people\u00a0hospitalized for a period of\u00a0time.\u00a0It flattened there for awhile\u00a0then went down to 17,000.\u00a0This is a low from our high\u00a0point of 16,000.\u00a0The question of whether we have\u00a0been passed the apex, past the\u00a0high point, and turned out the\u00a0high point wasn't a point, but it was a\u00a0plateau.\u00a0We got up to a high point and we\u00a0just stayed at that level for\u00a0awhile,\" Cuomo said at a news conference. Cuomo added: \"If the data holds and if this\u00a0trend holds, we are past the\u00a0high point and all indications\u00a0at this point is that we are on\u00a0the descent.\u00a0Whether or not the descent\u00a0continues depends on what we do\u00a0but right now we're on the\u00a0descent.\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNN that he thinks it will only be months, not years, before the US economy recovers from the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cI think it will be months,\u201d Mnuchin said today. \u201cI definitely don't think it will be years.\u201d Mnuchin said that once the economy reopens he believes there will be a \u201cbig rebound.\u201d Some economists\u00a0are very skeptical of any claims of a quick economic recovery. United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has \u201cabsolutely been leading our nation\u2019s effort to combat the coronavirus\u201d since the moment \u201cit became clear that there were challenges in terms of coronavirus developing in China,\u201d Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said at the Downing Street press conference Sunday. In response to a question over Johnson\u2019s lack of attendance at five Cobra meetings in January and February, Williamson said Johnson has been \u201cmaking sure that resources and money is not an issue or concern for any department, especially for health services.\" Cobra refers to interdepartmental government meetings called in times of crisis. \u201cMany Cobra meetings take place and I have spent many hours attending Cobra meetings where it is actually led by the departmental minister,\u201d Williamson said.  Johnson first chaired a coronavirus Cobra meeting on March 2. \u201cBut the focus that the prime minister was putting on this, and has continued to put on this, has meant that this is the whole government effort,\u201d he added. Williamson responded to criticism about\u00a0the government\u2019s response to acquiring personal protective equipment (PPE). He said the government has been trying to secure PPE \u201cfrom the first moment\u201d scientific advice highlighted \u201cwe were facing a real challenge in terms of the coronavirus.\" \u201cWhat we have seen over the last few months is an enormous effort \u2013 it\u2019s a national effort, but also an international effort to secure PPE from right around the globe,\u201d he added.\u00a0 It is still unknown whether being infected with the coronavirus and recovering will give you immunity from the virus in the future, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said on CBS today. \"That's why these studies that are going on with plasma and giving plasma to sick patients to really see if that antibody confers protective immunity and help to the individual who is sick, as well as really doing studies with vaccines and looking, seeing whether the antibodies that are produced are effective,\" Birx said. When asked whether the US could see a resurgence in cases, like in South Korea, and if that was a result of those being infected not building immunity, Birx said \u201cthose are questions we still have scientifically.\u201d\u00a0 Aside from HIV, people who contract most infectious diseases and recover develop antibodies, which often means people are immune.  But \u201cwe just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s immunity for a month, immunity for six months, immunity for six years,\u201d Birx said.\u00a0 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has responded to the Trump administration\u2019s claim that governors have plenty of coronavirus tests and should just get to work on testing. To \u201csay we aren\u2019t doing our job, is just absolutely false,\" Hogan told CNN on Sunday. Hogan said he and other governors are doing everything they can to push toward the reopening of their economies in a safe manner.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the president\u2019s own policy,\u201d Hogan said, adding that \u201cthe President\u2019s own guidelines say you should have 14 days of declining numbers before you start to consider phase 1 of reopening.\" \u201cTo encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, on Thursday, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Hogan added. Hogan summed up his thoughts on the mixed messages coming from the White House by saying, \u201cwe\u2019re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.\u201d Some context: Since the earlier days of the crisis, the nation's governors and the Trump administration have tangled over whether the much-needed expansion of testing capacity is the responsibility of the states or the federal government. Exasperated after a week in which industry leaders,\u00a0governors, Democratic senators\u00a0and even allies warned Trump and\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence that the nation cannot get back to business-as-usual without a substantial increase in testing nationally,\u00a0Trump faulted governors Saturday for not moving quickly enough\u00a0to ramp up capacity in their states. Pushing back on Trump's insistence that the federal government should merely serve as a backstop for states, several governors have argued that Trump's hope for\u00a0reopening the economy\u00a0cannot happen until there is adequate testing in their states and that they need federal aid to do that. But during a White House briefing Saturday, the President lashed out at governors for complaining and charged that testing is simply the\u00a0latest coronavirus issue\u00a0that Democrats are politicizing to convince Americans that Trump is mishandling the coronavirus response. Children will not be able to return to schools in the United Kingdom until the government has achieved its five point plan to ensure it is safe to adjust any of the current coronavirus measures, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said at the daily Downing Street news conference on Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe will work with the [education] sector to consider how best to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges when the time is right,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cOur first priority has always been protecting the wellbeing of children and young people, but particularly vulnerable young people.\" Some context: The number of people who have died in UK hospitals due to coronavirus has increased to 16,060, the Department of Health said Sunday. The government said Sunday that 120,067 people have now tested positive for coronavirus. ##Daily Life## Although Metropolitan Transportation Authority ridership is down, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is calling on the MTA to work better with the New York City Police Department about social distancing and monitoring the number of people that can be on each car. \u201cI think the MTA needs to do a better job of defining really clearly what\u2019s the maximum number of people that should be on a subway car and ensuring with the NYPD there is never more than that number on a subway car,\" the mayor said. MTA spokesman Shams Tarek responded with the following statement:  \u201cAs the Mayor knows, we have been working closely with the NYPD on this very issue for weeks.\u00a0Even with subway ridership down more than 90 percent, we are making it possible for doctors, nurses, first responders, grocery and pharmacy workers, and other essential personnel to get to work and save lives. Shutting down mass transit during this unprecedented crisis would be dangerous and could lead to even more deaths.\u00a0The MTA has led the nation in its efforts to protect its employees and customers, disinfecting its stations and full fleet of rolling stock and even breaking away from federal guidance and providing hundreds of thousands of masks to our heroic workforce before the CDC recommended it.\u201d Some context: The New York City mayor's comment comes after he was asked about some members of the city council urging the governor to shut down the subway because it\u2019s spreading the coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 The mayor also said he doesn\u2019t know another way people could get around if trains were shutdown. This post was updated with the MTA response. The 1918 influenza pandemic \u2013 often called the \"Spanish flu\" although it did not originate in Spain \u2013 \u00a0killed more than 50 million people globally and\u00a0about 675,000 in the US. \"The intensity and speed with which it struck were almost unimaginable \u2014 infecting one-third of the Earth's population,\" the World Health Organization said. Fast-forward to 2020, the coronavirus is also spreading with astonishing speed as officials and medical experts grapple with how to slow the virus and keep people safe. Some of the painful lessons learned from the 1918 pandemic are still relevant today and could help prevent an equally catastrophic outcome. Here's what we could learn from the past: Lesson #1: Don't let up on social distancing too soon During the Spanish flu pandemic, people stopped distancing too early, leading to a second wave of infections that was deadlier than the first, epidemiologists say. \"The image that we have of this epidemic curve, we say we're going to reach a 'peak' \u2014 we look at it, it looks like Mt. Fuji in our minds ... a single, solitary mountain,\" epidemiologist Dr. Larry Brilliant said. \"I don't think it's going to look like that. I think a better image is a wave of a tsunami, with echoed waves that follow. And it's up to us, how big those other waves will be,\" he added. Lesson #2: Young, healthy adults can be victims of their strong immune systems Young, healthy people are not invincible and their strong immune systems might work against them. \"In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem \u2014 it is one that works too well,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent\u00a0Dr. Sanjay Gupta\u00a0said.  \"In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs,\" he added. Lesson #3: Don't throw unproven drugs at the virus The Spanish flu and the novel coronavirus pandemics share two major challenges: the lack of a vaccine and the lack of a cure. Back in 1918, remedies \"varied from the newly developed drugs to oils and herbs,\" according to\u00a0a Stanford University research post.  \"The therapy was much less scientific than the diagnostics, as the drugs had no clear explanatory theory of action,\" the post said. In 2020, there is\u00a0widespread speculation\u00a0about whether\u00a0hydroxychloroquine\u00a0\u2013 a drug used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 could help coronavirus patients. The bottom line: It's still not clear whether some drugs will cause more harm than good in the fight against coronavirus. ##Health## Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said he\u2019d like to see at least two weeks of decreasing coronavirus cases and ramped up testing capabilities before he starts opening up businesses in his state.  \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re doing it responsibly and we\u2019re doing it safely,\u201d Northam told CNN today. When asked about President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s statements over the past few days on how the US has enough testing capacity for states to begin opening back up, Northam responded by saying, \u201cthat\u2019s just delusional to be making statements like that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting for testing, it\u2019s not a straightforward test. We don\u2019t even have enough swabs believe it or not,\u201d Northam said. \u201cFor the national level to say that we have what we need and really to have no guidance to the state levels, it\u2019s just irresponsible because we\u2019re just not there yet,\u201d he added. More than 1,400 medical workers have volunteered to help nursing homes and hospitals across the city, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference today. The volunteers will be divided over 40 hospitals and 40 nursing homes, the mayor said. There are 535 military nurses, respiratory therapists, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners and pharmacists at NYC Health and Hospitals. De Blasio also made a plea for anyone that has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and has recovered to give blood so health officials could use the plasma to fight the disease. As the weather gets better, the New York Police Department and Parks Department are stepping up enforcement citywide, targeting hotspots for complaints and non-compliance, de Blasio said. There will be fines of up to $1,000 if people ignore the social distancing rules, de Blasio said. By the numbers: At least 317 people were admitted to the hospital for suspected coronavirus cases across New York City, de Blasio said. That number is up from 261 people admitted on April 16, the mayor says. There are at least 849 people in NYC Health and Hospitals ICUs, that number is down from 880 people on April 16. The number of people who have died in United Kingdom hospitals due to coronavirus has increased to 16,060, the Department of Health said today. The government said Sunday that 120,067 people have now tested positive for coronavirus. Read the department's tweet: During an interview with Fox News Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence defended President Trump\u2019s coronavirus response saying he believed there would soon be enough testing to reopen the country. When asked to give his opinion of the protestors and Trump\u2019s \u201cLIBERATE\u201d tweets, Pence said \u201cthe American people know that no one in America wants to reopen this country more than Donald Trump\u201d and that the President is going to continue to \u201cencourage governors safely and responsibly let America go back to work.\u201d\u00a0 On testing, the vice president said the administration believes that \u201conce we activate all the labs that can do coronavirus testing,\u201d it will be sufficient for any state in America to move into phase one. \u00a0 Pence said \u201cat President Trump\u2019s direction, we\u2019re going to continue to fully partner with governors around the country and health officials in increasing and scaling the amount of testing \u2014 and we have every confidence that we can have a sufficient amount of testing to reopen America.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he thinks Congress will come to an agreement today on a new emergency funding bill that would give money to small businesses and disaster loan programs. \"I'm hopeful that we can reach\u00a0an agreement that the senate can\u00a0pass this tomorrow, and that the\u00a0House can take it up on Tuesday.\u00a0Wednesday we would be back up\u00a0and running,\" Mnuchin told CNN moments ago. \"I think we're very close to a\u00a0deal today.\u00a0I'm hopeful that we can get that\u00a0done.\" Mnuchin said he believes another small business package could allocate $300 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, $50 billion appropriated for disaster loans, $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion to invest in testing. \"These two programs are\u00a0unprecedented response to small\u00a0businesses,\" Mnuchin added. \"We're talking about a $25\u00a0billion federal program \u2013\u2013 money\u00a0that can be used with the\u00a0states, with new technology, to\u00a0invest in testing,\" Mnuchin added. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said small businesses in her state need funding \"right now\" as the state is still weeks away from reaching a peak in coronavirus cases. \"Many of them are facing a\u00a0situation where they worry that\u00a0they won't be able to reopen,\" she told CNN today. \"It's our obligation to\u00a0get them the relief that they\u00a0need.\" Raimondo said coronavirus cases in the state are still increasing each day, and she will not be able to relax restrictions on businesses until \"we're on the backside of that curve.\" Like businesses, hospitals also need emergency relief funding from the federal government, Raimondo added. \"The White House and\u00a0governors asked our hospitals to\u00a0stop doing elective surgery for\u00a0safety reasons.\u00a0That's their main source of\u00a0revenue.\u00a0We have to be there for the\u00a0hospitals to help them,\" she said. Raimondo said that while she agrees the next federal stimulus bill should include money or hospitals and state governments \u2013\u00a0not just strictly businesses \u2013 this isn't a time for politics. \"It isn't time to play politics,\" she said. \"It's time to deliver outcomes\u00a0for the American people.\u00a0That's what they're expecting\u00a0from their leaders right now.\" ##Health## Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has released the names\u00a0of nursing homes and long-term care facilities with Covid-19 cases. \u201cGovernor DeSantis also announced that he has encouraged the Florida Department of Health to release the names of the long-term care facilities in the state of Florida that have had residents or staff test positive for Covid-19. There are currently 303 long-term care facilities with positive cases of Covid-19. The Florida Department of Health has published the list\u00a0here,\" DeSantis' office said in a news release. Florida has recorded 25,492 coronavirus cases and 748 deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. ##Health## Spanish Ministry of Health released new figures Sunday that show 410 new coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to\u00a020,453. This figure represents a 2% rise and a slower increase than last week\u2019s average. The records show a total of 98,134 active cases in Spain, a 1.1% increase since Saturday, which is in line with average increases over the past week. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, Spain\u2019s director of health emergencies, reported a 1.3% rise in hospital admissions, and a 1.4% rise in intensive care unit, ICU, admissions over the last 24-hour period.\u00a0Speaking at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus technical group briefing, Sim\u00f3n said the numbers reflected a \u201csubstantial reduction of infections.\u201d ##Health## Singapore reported 942 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Saturday\u00a0-- the highest daily jump so far,\u00a0according to a statement from the city-state's Ministry of Health. Most of the cases involve migrant workers living in dormitories, according to the ministry, which said that only 14 of the 942 new cases were Singapore citizens or permanent residents. After initial success in mitigating the spread of the virus, Singapore has seen a recent spike in cases, including an outbreak among foreign workers who typically live in cramped dormitories.  The government responded with what it called a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d in early April, banning all social gatherings and closing schools and most workplaces. Singapore recently\u00a0announced that it would move uninfected foreign workers in essential services into alternative living arrangements such as military camps, vacant government apartments and floating hotels. \u201cThe numbers in the migrant worker dorms are still going up,\u201d Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote on his Facebook page on Saturday.  \u201cIn the broader community, there are a few early signs that the circuit breaker is bringing cases down. But we are still worried about hidden cases circulating in our population, which are keeping the outbreak going.\u201d Singapore has so far recorded a total of 6,588 cases of coronavirus with 11 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. For analysis on how Singapore's experience shows relaxing too soon can backfire, read here: A senior UK government figure has defended Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to the coronavirus pandemic, following a wide-ranging critique in the Sunday Times newspaper. Cabinet minister Michael Gove\u00a0described the Sunday Times piece -- which reported that Johnson had missed five emergency meetings on the virus and accused the government of failing to order protective equipment or heed scientists' warnings -- as \"off beam.\" \"The idea that the Prime Minister skipped meetings that were vital to our response to the coronavirus, I think is grotesque,\" Gove told Sophy Ridge on Sky News on Sunday. \"The truth is that there were meetings across government, some of which were chaired by the Health Secretary, some by other ministers, but the Prime Minister took all major decisions,\" said Gove. \"Nobody can say that the Prime Minister wasn't throwing heart and soul into fighting this virus. His leadership has been clear. He's been inspirational at times.\" Speaking later on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Gove acknowledged that Johnson had not attended the five Cobra meetings but said this was not unusual since such meetings were usually led by the relevant Secretary of State. Cobra is the colloquial name given to interdepartmental meetings in the Cabinet Office Briefing Room \"A.\" Because of the serious nature of these meetings, they are usually chaired by the PM or another senior minister. Johnson first chaired a Cobra meeting on coronavirus on March 2.\u00a0 Gove added that the Sunday Times article was using this information \u201cout of context\u201d and \u201cwhipped [it] up in order to create a \u2018j\u2019accuse\u2019 narrative.\u201d The Sunday Times report also stated that a number of opportunities to reduce the impact of the pandemic had been missed by the UK government in January, February and March. The government has been criticized over shortages of personal protective equipment for frontline health and social care workers and a slow start to testing for the virus. A Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement Sunday that the government had been \"working day and night to battle against coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed at all times to protect our NHS and save lives,\" and guided by medical and scientific expertise. \u201cOur response has ensured that the NHS has been given all the support it needs to ensure everyone requiring treatment has received it, as well as providing protection to businesses and reassurance to workers,\" the statement said. \"The Prime Minister has been at the helm of the response to this, providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation.\u201d Johnson continues to recuperate at his official country retreat following treatment in intensive care for Covid-19. The Prime Minister is \u201crecovering well\u201d and is in \u201ccheerful spirits,\u201d Gove told Sky. Gove said Johnson had spoken with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday to deliver instructions to the government. Johnson continues to follow the advice of his doctors in order to make sure that he \u201crests and recovers fully,\u201d Gove said. He added that the Prime Minister is \u201cabsolutely on top of things.\u201d There are at least\u00a0735,287\u00a0coronavirus cases in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. At least\u00a039,090\u00a0people have died. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases.

But the collapse of demand for air travel means its airline customers may not need those jets -- or even accept them.\u00a0 \"If you're an airline today, your last focus these days is buying airplanes, your primary focus is survival,\" said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. News that Boeing plans to\u00a0resume production\u00a0helped lift its shares 14% Friday. But it doesn't change the fact that so far this year Boeing has had four times as many\u00a0orders\u00a0for new jets canceled -- 196 -- as it has booked new orders. Another 160 orders have been deferred and are no longer counted in its backlog of orders.\u00a0 And while most of the canceled planes are Boeing's troubled 737 Max, which has been\u00a0grounded\u00a0since March 2019 following\u00a0two fatal crashes\u00a0that killed 346 people, the problem is much broader than that safety issue. It's the fact that airlines aren't going to need new planes for the\u00a0foreseeable future. Of the worldwide fleet of 26,000 passenger jets, nearly 17,000, or 64%, are now parked at airports, according to tracking service Cirium.

Congregational prayers will be held but strict disciplinary measures will be in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Alvi said. Ramadan this year is expected to begin at sundown on April 23. After a consultation with the country\u2019s top religious scholars, the president released a 20-point action plan. This includes measures such as requiring people to wear masks in mosques and providing a police presence there to ensure social distancing is in place. Alvi added that the government would review and change any part of its policy on mosques during Ramadan if these measures were not being followed or if the number of cases were to rise exponentially. The number of diagnosed coronavirus cases as of Sunday in Pakistan was 7,993, with 159 deaths, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has called for an \"independent review\" of the circumstances that led to the start of the coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0adding to growing pressure on China over its handling of the virus.\u00a0 \"We need to know the sorts of details that an independent review would identify for us about the genesis of the virus, about the approaches to dealing with it, and addressing it, about the openness with which information was shared, about interaction with the World Health Organization, interaction with other international leaders,\" she said in an interview with Australia's ABC television on Sunday.  \"All of those sorts of things will need to be on the table.\" Paine said that when it comes to Australia's relationship with China,\u00a0\"transparency is\u00a0essential.\"\u00a0 Asked whether she believes\u00a0the World Health Organization is too \"beholden\" of China, she said Australia shares the concerns that the US has expressed.\u00a0 \"I think it is about an independent mechanism, and I\u2019m not sure that you can have the health organization, which has been responsible for disseminating much of the international communications material, and doing much of the early engagement and investigative work, also as the review mechanism,\" Payne said.  \"That strikes me as somewhat poacher and gamekeeper.\" ##Health## Sixteen more people who had recovered from coronavirus and were released from quarantine have tested positive again for the infection, South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported on Sunday. This means that 179 people in total have retested positive after they were released from quarantine, out of 8,042 patients who've recovered from Covid-19 so far, KCDC director\u00a0Jung Eun-Kyeong told a press briefing. It is currently unclear why patients could be retesting positive. Most experts think it's unlikely that somebody will be reinfected right after recovering. It's possible that issues with testing -- or varying amounts of viral RNA in the body, which the tests look for -- could explain why people test positive after testing negative, experts say. An in-depth epidemiological\u00a0investigation is underway to figure out the cause, Jung said. Among all of the cases who have retested positive, patients in their 20s made up the highest number, with 41 cases (22.9%), followed by patients in their 50s, with 32 cases (17.9%), according to the KCDC. Most such cases test positive after an average of about 13 days following release from quarantine, Jung added, and so far no secondary infections have been reported from these cases. ##Health## Death toll passes 160,000: At least 160,917 people have died from Covid-19 and there are more than 2.3 million cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University\u00a0tally.

Lowest daily counts: China, where the outbreak started, reported 16 new coronavirus cases at the end of the day Saturday, its lowest daily increase since March 17.  Venezuela may postpone elections: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro wants the country\u2019s top court to postpone the parliamentary elections scheduled for December this year until January 2021. Maduro said the pandemic is the priority and it would be irresponsible to carry out elections in that environment.

But before he could say \"I do,\" Sonu Kumar Chouhan, a 24-year-old factory worker, was stopped by police and put into government quarantine.  Chouhan told CNN that he was due to get married on April 15 but the nationwide lockdown trapped him in Ludhiana town, in Punjab, where he works. His wedding venue was about 1,000 kilometers (500 miles) away in Maharajgunj, Utter Pradesh state.  \"After much discussion with friends, we decided to embark the 1,000-kilometer journey by cycle,\" Chouhan said, who traveled with three friends.  The group's plan was foiled when they were stopped at a police checkpoint in Utter Pradesh. \"We cycled day and night for a week to reach home but were caught in Balrampur district two days before the wedding. Had we covered next 150 kilometres I would be married by now, but the authorities did not allow me to cycle further,\" said Chouhan. The four men will be sent home from quarantine in 14 days if they don't show symptoms.\u00a0 India's nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 and will remain until May 3.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## ##Travel## Earlier this month, there was a funeral procession in the Sicilian town of Messina, in defiance of a nationwide\u00a0lockdown in Italy.\u00a0 It was no ordinary procession: The couple of dozen people walking behind the hearse were paying their respects to a 70-year-old scion of one of the most\u00a0notorious Mafia\u00a0famiglie. Claudio Fava, president of the regional anti-Mafia committee, described it as a \"real scandal, an insult to those who lost their relatives in the pandemic.\"\u00a0 Funerals have been banned in Italy since early March as part of a broader set of restrictions aimed at curbing the Covid-19 outbreak that has killed about 23,000 people. That the procession took place at all speaks to the power -- and the impunity -- wielded by the Mafia in parts of Italy. Taking advantage of the crisis: Senior anti-mafia officials and researchers have told CNN that Mafia clans are already taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic, especially in southern Italy.\u00a0 They are providing everyday necessities in poor neighborhoods, offering credit to businesses on the verge of bankruptcy and planning to siphon off a chunk of the billions of euros being lined up in stimulus funds.  \"What we are seeing -- and will see more and more as the economic and social crisis unfolds -- is Mafia groups returning to their core businesses of protection and governance,\" said Zora Hauser, a researcher into organized crime at Oxford University. The most powerful branch of the Mafia -- the 'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria -- is\u00a0thought to control 80% of the European cocaine market. Even as the pandemic made distribution more difficult, it took advantage of the lockdown.

The Tony Award-nominated star has been battling coronavirus for more than two weeks. His wife, Amanda Kloots,\u00a0has kept fans informed by sharing updates on his health on her Instagram. Saturday was day 18 of Cordero being sedated in the intensive care unit while battling coronavirus, Kloots told her social media followers.  While hospitalized, he started having clotting issues on his right leg, and could not get blood down to his toes. The blood thinners he got to fix the clotting issues were affecting his blood pressure and causing internal bleeding in his intestines, she said.\u00a0 \"They had him on blood thinners for the clotting, unfortunately the blood thinners were causing other issues,\" she said Saturday. \"The right leg will be amputated today.\" Read the full story here: ##Daily Life## In 1911, a deadly epidemic spread through China and threatened to become a pandemic. Its origins appeared to be related to the trade in wild animals, but at the time no one was sure.\u00a0 Lockdowns, quarantine measures, the wearing of masks, travel restrictions, the mass cremation of victims, and border controls were deployed to try to lower the infection rate. Yet more than 60,000 people died in modern-day northeast China, making it one of the world's largest epidemics at the time.\u00a0 When the disease was eventually brought under control, the Chinese government convened the International Plague Conference in the northern\u00a0city of Shenyang -- close to the epicenter of the outbreak.\u00a0 In attendance were virologists, bacteriologists, epidemiologists and disease experts from many of the world's major powers -- the United States, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and France. The purpose of the conference:  Experts wanted to find the cause of the outbreak, learn which suppression techniques were most effective, discover why the disease had spread so far so fast, and assess what could be done to prevent a second wave.  Learning the lessons: As the world faces a pandemic characterized by a lack of a globally co-ordinated response and multilateral effort on the part of political leaders, the collaborative aspects of the 1911 conference in China are worth reconsidering.

And then the second wave hit, hard. Since March 17, Singapore's number of confirmed coronavirus cases grew from 266 to over 5,900,\u00a0according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0 So what went wrong?\u00a0 Migrant workers: The answer appears to lie in overlooked clusters of cases among migrant workers living in cramped dormitories and an underestimation of the speed at which those infections could spread through a city where lockdown measures had not been put in place. Life as normal: Because Singapore was testing widely and isolating all those who were potentially contagious, it was able to remain relatively open and continue functioning as usual. This attitude was only viable if infections from overseas were kept out, and new potential cases were detected and dealt with quickly. Rapid spread: Once this measure failed, the speed at which the virus could pass from person to person was greater than it would be in a place with heavy lockdown and social distancing measures. For more on how Singapore's experience shows relaxing too soon can backfire, read here: The global death toll from the coronavirus has now passed 160,000 people, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.  At least 160,717 people have died from Covid-19 and there are more than 2.3 million cases worldwide.

Of the total cases, 77,062 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the health commission. Out of the 16 new cases, nine were imported. Six are related to Heilongjiang Province on China\u2019s northeastern border with Russia. The border area has seen a recent rise in Covid-19 infections.  In a separate count, 44 new asymptomatic infections were reported by the NHC. There are currently 999 asymptomatic cases under medical observation.\u00a0 ##Health## On CNN's on \"The Color of Covid,\" anchor Don Lemon shared some stark statistics that show how disproportionately black and brown communities in the United States are being impacted by the coronavirus crisis. The following is compiled from US states where data could be collected -- just over half. African Americans are dying at two-and-a-half times the rate of Asian Americans, three times higher than Latinos, and 3.6 times higher than whites.\u00a0\nIn Michigan, blacks make up nearly half of the death toll but they are only 14% of the population.\u00a0\nIn at least eight other states in the Midwest, the South and East, the death rate exceeds the population rate for blacks by more than 20 percentage points.\u00a0\nFor Hispanic Americans the death rate is unusually high in the country\u2019s coronavirus epicenter, New York City.   Poverty and healthcare: Minorities make up half of the nation\u2019s uninsured. There is one big reason why: Native Americans, blacks and hispanics are more likely to be in poverty.\u00a0 ##Health## CNN correspondent Nick Valencia said on CNN's \"The Color of Covid\" special\u00a0that Hispanic Americans\u00a0are suffering the\u00a0most in New York City, where the community makes\u00a0up more than a third of virus-related deaths. Social economic\u00a0factors and inequality is at play. In New York, 34% of\u00a0the death rate is made up by\u00a0Latinos, \"and that is not even\u00a0counting undocumented\u00a0immigrants who may be afraid\u00a0are showing symptoms are sick\u00a0and are free to go into the\u00a0doctor,\" Valencia said.  The jobs that Latino's have may put the community more at risk of\u00a0contracting the coronavirus.\u00a0 In New York, there are at least 242,424 coronavirus cases and 17,627 deaths.  ##Health##  ##Daily Life## South Korea reported eight new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases topped 10,000 in Japan on Saturday. On March 1, the country had 243 cases. As of Saturday, Japan had 10,296 confirmed cases, including 222 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. That tally included people who tested positive during airport quarantine checks and health officials. In recent weeks, Japan's coronavirus cases have spiked -- dashing hopes that the government's initial virus response had succeeded.\u00a0 The sharp increase has led Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to extend the state of emergency from seven prefectures to the entire country. On Friday, he promised to provide medical equipment, such as surgical masks, gowns and face shields, to struggling hospitals. Earlier this week, government experts warned that Japan could have more than\u00a0400,000 coronavirus-related deaths\u00a0if measures such as social distancing were not implemented.

Currently, about 150,000 tests per day are completed, and about 20% of those tests have been positive. The positive test rate needs to fall to 10%. Japan cases surge: Reported cases have surpassed 10,000 as medical workers warn the country's health system isn't prepared for an outbreak. The spike has led Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to extend the state of emergency from seven prefectures to be nationwide. Spain to extend lockdown: Another 15 days of lockdown are looming, with the restrictions set to extend until May 9. That means Spain will have endured eight week of strict lockdown and comes after deaths in the country surpassed 20,000.   ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Travel## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new details on community mitigation, as part of the White House Task Force\u2019s plan to \"get and keep America open.\" The guidelines, posted overnight Friday\u00a0on the CDC website, outline steps persons can take to help slow the transmission of the virus. New concepts include emphasizing personal responsibility and tailoring strategies to target specific populations. \"Mitigation\u00a0strategies can be scaled up or down depending on the evolving local situation,\" the CDC said on its website. \"When developing mitigation plans, communities should identify ways to ensure the safety and social well-being of groups that may be especially impacted by mitigation strategies, including individuals at increased risk for severe illness.\" Regarding financial resources, the CDC said it has awarded nearly $730 million in funding to carry out surveillance, epidemiology, laboratory capacity, infection control, mitigation, communications and other preparedness and response activities. The CDC says it has \"500 existing field staff embedded in state, tribal, local and territorial health agencies, most of whom have pivoted to support the COVID-19 response.\" Community protection teams are being\u00a0sent to eight states to conduct contact tracing. The eight states include: Alaska\nIdaho\nKentucky\nNew Mexico\nNorth Dakota\nOhio\nWest Virginia\nWyoming Rapid testing on a wide scale and contract-tracing to quickly isolate outbreaks are widely considered to be necessary to reopen the economy.

To achieve a 10% test positivity rate by May 1, about 580,000 people per day would need to be tested, research shows.\u00a0  The researchers include: Dr. Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute\nDr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\nBenjamin Jacobson, research assistant at the Harvard Global Health Institute Jha wrote in an email to CNN that a formal write-up of their research will be available soon. \u201cIf we can\u2019t be doing at least 500,000 tests a day by May 1, it is hard to see any way we can remain open,\u201d the researchers wrote. President Donald Trump told reporters the US has conducted more than 3.78 million coronavirus tests to date at a Friday White House briefing. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Business## Invoking his favorite phrase of criticism directed at the Russia investigation, President Donald Trump said the response to the coronavirus \u201c\u2026should not be a partisan witch hunt.\u201d He added that \u201cwe have to work together\u201d to address the pandemic. However, Trump attacked three Democratic governors Friday\u00a0urging people to \u201cliberate\u201d Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia. For two days in a row, Trump has harshly criticized Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, wrongly claiming Northam wants to take away the Second Amendment rights of Virginians. Trump is referring to\u00a0a bill Northam signed\u00a0that allows law enforcement to take temporary control of guns if people are deemed a danger to themselves or others. Trump claimed that some people are \"attempting to bring this into politics.\"\u00a0He later claimed that Democratic senators were \"nasty\" and \"rude\" on a phone call with Vice President Mike Pence yesterday when several senators asked tough questions about the lack of testing availability. ##Daily Life##"], "Language": false}
