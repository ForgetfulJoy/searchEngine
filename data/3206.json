However, you've probably heard a lot about natural deodorant, and you may have tried it yourself \u2014 possibly with mixed results. If you're thinking about making the switch, you're in the right place. Dr. Hadley King, New York City-based dermatologist, shared pretty much everything a newbie needs to know about the benefits of natural deodorant, what the deal is with \"detox time,\" and how to find the best natural deodorant for you.  Natural deodorant benefits  You may have heard about some of the supposed health benefits of natural deodorants, like how they usually don't include aluminum \u2014 although, according to King, there's little scientific support for the claim that aluminum in deodorants is a health risk.  \"Aluminum has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and to breast cancer, but whether or not the aluminum in antiperspirants contributes to these conditions is not yet definitively known and there is no research data showing this,\" says King. \"The American Cancer Society states: 'There are no strong epidemiologic studies in the medical literature that link breast cancer risk and antiperspirant use, and very little scientific evidence to support this claim.'\" Natural deodorants also tend to avoid ingredients like parabens, which some suspect may be carcinogenic, and triclosan, which King says has been involved in studies that link it to disrupting the endocrine system and increased risk of cancer.  But regardless of any scientifically proven health benefits (or lack thereof), if you're looking to try a natural deodorant for the first time, you'll want something that works, for which King has some advice. \"You want products containing ingredients that absorb moisture and/or slow down bacterial growth,\" she says. \"Moisture-absorbing properties are helpful for absorbing underarm wetness. And antimicrobial properties slow down bacterial growth, which is responsible for odor.\" The three ingredients she suggests looking for are charcoal, arrowroot powder and zeolite mineral salts. \"Charcoal won't block sweat the way that aluminum-based antiperspirants can by blocking eccrine ducts, but it can absorb moisture, so it can be helpful to absorb underarm wetness,\" King says. \"And it also has antibacterial properties, which means it can also help prevent odor. Arrowroot powder is another moisture-absorbing ingredient found in some natural deodorants.\"  Meanwhile, so-called \"crystal deodorants\" use zeolite mineral salts such as potassium alum or ammonium alum, which may have natural antimicrobial properties, according to King. \"They slow down bacterial growth,\" she says. \"They are not going to keep your armpits dry, they only help prevent odor.\" To detox or not to detox  Now, you may have heard that the switch from a conventional antiperspirant to a natural deodorant will produce a \"detox\" period, during which you may be smellier than usual, while your armpit bacteria adjust to the change. In fact, your old antiperspirant may have been encouraging smelly bacteria, even though it was keeping them under control. \"One small study showed that antiperspirants can increase the amount of Actinobacteria, a particularly bad-smelling bacteria, that happens naturally,\" King says. It takes time for a new bunch of bacteria \u2014 your armpit microbiome \u2014 to replace the old one. One popular option to reduce this detox time is creating your own armpit mask, King says, which can involve a homemade mixture of bentonite clay and apple cider vinegar. Though she's not sold on whether a mask can really shorten this detox time, if you want to try it, she does recommend using water to dilute the vinegar since it can irritate your skin.  Whether you try a detox mask, or just wait out the bacteria change, natural deodorants may be worth a try if you're looking to move to a cleaner beauty and self-care routine, or have just been increasingly curious about whether or not they could work for you. After all, if there was ever a time to be a little smellier, wouldn't it be now?
