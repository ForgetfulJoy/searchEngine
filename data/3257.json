The UK will have to rely on social distancing measures until there is a vaccine or a treatment for coronavirus, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said during the daily Downing Street briefing on Wednesday. \u201cIn the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally. One of which is highly effective vaccine, and there are a variety of ways vaccines can be deployed. They can be deployed for dampening down epidemics, they can be deployed to protect vulnerable people. Or, and or, highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people,\" Whitty said. Whitty cautioned that achieving that goal will take time and that the outbreak will have to be managed through social distancing measure until then. \u201cUntil we have those, and the probability of having those anytime in the next calendar year are incredibly small, and I think we should be realistic about that, we\u2019re going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive, as everyone is finding at the moment. But until that point, that is what we will have to do,\" Whitty said. \"But it's going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that,\" he added. The\u00a0Spanish parliament voted\u00a0to approve\u00a0the extension of its state of emergency proclamation\u00a0for the third time\u00a0until May 9. The state of\u00a0emergency was first decreed\u00a0on March 14,\u00a0which ordered severe restrictions on movement and business.\u00a0 Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez argued for another extension during a speech on Wednesday morning.\u00a0 \"This extension is different than the others\u201d\u00a0Sanchez said.\u00a0\"It's the first time I can do this with a carefully optimistic future. It is [the extension] that will begin to de-escalate the rules of confinement\", he\u00a0added.\u00a0 Sanchez warned parliament members that the next phase of de-escalation and the return to normality \u201cneeds to be slow, gradual and therefore secure.\u201d The prime minister also mentioned that his\u00a0government is \"implementing a control system\" for people traveling from inside or outside of Spain \"to avoid more imported contagions.\"\u00a0 \"Each mistake we do now, each challenge we fail, each delay caused by other interests will be a weight we will carry in the next months and years,\" he\u00a0added. Spain has the world\u2019s second highest cases of coronavirus cases, the country has enforced Europe\u2019s strictest restrictions of movement. ##Daily Life## \u00a0 There will be no knightings or awarding of other honors at Buckingham Palace in June, and the annual Garter service at Windsor Castle \u2013 where Knights of the Garter process with the Queen \u2013 has also been called off, a Royal Communications statement Wednesday said. \u201cFor practical reasons in the current circumstances all investitures due to be held at Buckingham Palace in June have been postponed. The annual Garter service at Windsor Castle has been cancelled,\u201d the statement said. ##Daily Life## The majority of nurses in Spain say they have been working during the Covid-19 crisis without enough protective equipment, according to a study by the Spanish College of Nursing (CGE). Of the 11,000 nurses surveyed across Spain, 74% said there were no masks in their work unit and 55% reported a lack of protective gowns. \"Health workers didn't have the most basic protection equipment against the virus, which could explain the extremely high number of workers infected in our country,\u201d CGE, the professional body for the Spanish nursing profession, said in a press release on Wednesday. However, the Spanish College of Nursing believes there are many more cases among health workers than have been reported, as the study reveals two-thirds of nurses reported having symptoms but weren't able to get tested. The report also reveals 5% of nurses had to work with symptoms. Madrid, the hardest hit by the virus of Spain\u2019s 17 regions, was also the region with the most number of nurses who reported having symptoms compatible with Covid-19. In a lengthy report about Covid-19, the Ministry of Health said \u201cthe high contagion rate among health care workers could be attributed to different factors.\u201d In the initial phase especially when there was less knowledge about how the virus was transmitted, the report said, cases \u201ccould have been generated among health care workers improperly protected.\u201d The College of Nursing study also reveals that many workers said they didn't receive enough Covid-19-specific training to treat infected patients or use the special protective equipment. Some nurses also reported receiving \"poor quality\" supplies, such as having to reuse or wash masks and gowns, spending up to 14 hours with the same equipment, and reusing it the next day. ##Health## Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has tested negative for Covid-19, Dr. Zafar Mirza, his special adviser on health, announced in a tweet Wednesday. \"I am happy to report that his test is NEGATIVE,\" Mirza tweeted. Some background: The decision to test Khan came after\u00a0Pakistan\u2019s eminent philanthropist Faisal Edhi announced on Tuesday that he has tested positive for Covid-19.\u00a0Khan and Edhi met in person six days ago. According to Pakistan\u2019s ministry of health, the number of diagnosed coronavirus cases in the country is now 10,076. ##Health## \u00a0 At least 25,085 people have died in connection with Covid-19 in Italy, according to the Italian Civil Protection Agency.  There are now 107,699 active cases of Covid-19 in Italy.  The total number of cases, including deaths and recoveries, is now 187,327. ##Health##\u00a0 If the World Food Program\u2019s supply chain breaks down, \u201cpeople will die and not just of Covid-19, but of starvation,\u201d WFP Director David Beasley told CNN\u2019s Hala Gorani on Wednesday. Beasley warned that this was not a \u201csky-is-falling\" scenario, but a reality they are currently facing. \u201cIt\u2019s not just food, it\u2019s a number of things. If that supply chain breaks down, we can\u2019t move goods and services, we can\u2019t move supplies,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cWe now know 135 million people are walking towards the brink of starvation. Out of that 135, we feed 100 million, but 30 million depend totally on us.\" \u201cSo if the supply chain breaks down or if the money falls apart, then if 100 million don\u2019t get food, then 100 million don\u2019t live. Then it\u2019s a very bleak situation, so we are very concerned about this.\u201d Beasley said the WFP needs $350 million for extra flights to Africa to help move medical professionals into the country because commercial airlines have shut down. \u201cWe have already transported literally millions of testing kits, billions of masks, millions of PPE we have got to keep that rolling out there. That\u2019s where that money comes into play, so we can help these countries in Africa,\u201d Beasley said. Beasley said the world was already facing the worst humanitarian crisis in 2020 due to wars in Yemen and Syria. Now it\u2019s a \u201cperfect storm of extraordinary proportions,\u201d he said.

She added that these patients are likely not contagious. \u201cOne can presume that depending on the patient, the virus can stay for different lengths of periods in the body without being completely removed even after neutralizing antibodies had formed. Additional study is underway,\u201d Jung said. About the analysis: The KCDC conducted analysis on 25 recovered patients to determine whether the Covid-19 virus could be detected. 25 patients had formed neutralizing antibodies against the virus, and 12 patients tested positive for Covid-19. When the samples from the 12 patients were cultivated the results were negative, Jung said. Samples were taken from 39 cases that retested positive and so far 6 samples did not cultivate the virus.\u00a0Examination on 33 other samples is ongoing. ##Health##  Global carbon emissions are expected to fall 6% this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said it\u2019s \u201cshort-term\u201d good news for the environment, but won\u2019t be enough to get the world back on track to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement targets. \u201cThis crisis has had an impact on the emissions of greenhouse gases,\u201d Taalas said during a virtual press briefing. \u201cWe estimate that there is going to be a 6% drop in carbon emissions this year because of the lack of emissions from transportation and industry and energy production.\u201d The WMO says while the coronavirus pandemic may result in a temporary reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it is not a substitute for sustained climate action. \u201cWhilst Covid-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems and economies for centuries,\u201d Taalas added.\u00a0\u201cWe need to flatten both the pandemic and climate change curves.\u201d The last major cruise ship remaining at sea during the coronavirus pandemic docked in the port of Genoa, Italy today, regional council member\u00a0Giacomo Giampedrone told CNN. The planned docking of the Costa Deliziosa was delayed Tuesday due to poor weather conditions. \u201cThe Costa Deliziosa has docked and health care personnel will go on board shortly, to transport the body of a woman who died on April 6 to the forensic office where a coronavirus test will be done, mainly as a precaution. Her death seems not be related to coronavirus,\u201d Giampedrone told CNN. \u201cThis afternoon the first 540 passengers will disembark, while 897 more will do on Thursday afternoon,\u201d Giampedrone said. \"The ship is clean and with no people isolated on board,\u201d  \u201cWe will carry out a protected disembarking, just like we did in other cases of cruise ships that had coronavirus cases on board. But this time we are protecting more the people on board, who have been sailing since mid-March, than vice versa\u201d Giampedrone said. Some context: The port of Genoa was chosen as the final destination of Costa Deliziosa by the Italian Transport Minister and the regional governor. The cruise line company will provide transportation to all passengers and the 900 crew members, according to Giampedrone.  ##Daily Life## ##Travel## If the UK changes its policy and begins recommending the use of face masks for the public, the government will not be able to promise everybody free masks, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament today.\u00a0 \u201cWe will follow the advice and will listen to what the SAGE [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]\u00a0says on masks. And then we will implement that,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cI can't promise that we will give everybody free masks. I mean that would be an extraordinary undertaking,\" he added. \"And we do have to make sure we have supplies available especially for health and care staff where the scientific advice has been throughout that the wearing of masks is necessary in those circumstances,\u201d Hancock explained. \u201cWe have got to make sure the provision is for them.\u201d Some context: The British government has faced intense criticism over its handling of the crisis, including a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers and a slow roll-out of coronavirus testing. ##Health## ##Daily Life## India's government has introduced an urgent executive order to discourage violence against health workers, according to a government announcement following a cabinet meeting today. What this is about: Reports of attacks and discrimination against healthcare workers have surfaced in India over the past two months.\u00a0In March, medical staff in the nation's capital New Delhi were being evicted and facing threats that their electricity would be cut off.\u00a0 Earlier this month, CNN reported a\u00a0mob pelted frontline health care workers with stones as they tried to treat a patient who was suspected of contracting the novel coronavirus in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. \u201cHealth workers who are trying to save the country from this epidemic are unfortunately facing attacks. No incident of violence or harassment against them will be tolerated. An ordinance has been brought in, it'll be implemented after President's sanction,\u201d Union Minister P Javadekar said. \u2018\"We have zero tolerance and will not allow this in a civilized society,\u201d the minister added.\u00a0\u201cSuch crimes will now be cognizable and non-bailable. Investigation will be done in 30 days.\u201d The coronavirus blame game has reached a new level after\u00a0Missouri announced it was suing China\u00a0over the crisis. The US state is seeking damages for what it described as a campaign of \u201cdeception\u201d and insufficient action to halt a \u201cpreventable\u201d pandemic \u2014 allegations Beijing strongly denies. The conflagration over China is becoming a key flashpoint in the 2020 race, with President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden sparring over the country\u2019s role in the spread of the virus. The battle could turn into a critical showdown in November\u2019s election,\u00a0Stephen Collinson writes.\u00a0\u00a0 Beijing has faced intense scrutiny and criticism over its handling of the coronavirus, and not only from Washington. But the pandemic still presents an opportunity for China to solidify its status as a superpower and global leader \u2013 especially as Trump alienates some allies with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach,\u00a0James Griffiths writes.\u00a0\u00a0 One outspoken critic of China\u2019s government knows what it means to be socially isolated. The\u00a0dissident artist Ai Weiwei, who was detained for three months by authorities back in 2011, told CNN that the coronavirus had only strengthened the \u201cpolice state\u201d in China.\u00a0\u00a0 With the Wuhan epidemic now contained, David Culver\u00a0has returned to see how people there are navigating a new normal, after nearly three months living in lockdown.\u00a0 Here are Wednesday's other developments... Trump backs off full immigration ban: Trump has announced a\u00a060-day ban on immigrants seeking green cards\u00a0to live in America permanently, but backed away from plans to stop workers entering the country on a temporary basis.\u00a0 Famine of \"biblical proportions\": The developing world is facing\u00a0\u201cmultiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months\u201d\u00a0unless urgent action is taken, the UN\u2019s food relief agency said. It warned that the pandemic would push an additional 130 million people to the brink of starvation, on top of another 135 million who were already facing crisis levels of hunger.\u00a0\u00a0 Homeschooling widens inequality gap: A staggering 90% of the world's students are in lockdown. But it\u2019s going to hit poor kids much harder than rich ones. The\u00a0inequality gap, present in education systems at the best of times, is being exacerbated by school closures worldwide, experts say.\u00a0\u00a0 Bangladeshi garment workers face ruin: When Fatema Akther arrived for work at the Alif Casual Wear garment factory in Dhaka in late March, she had no idea it would be her last day. She\u2019s one of millions of garment workers \u2014 most of them women \u2014 estimated to have been furloughed or\u00a0laid off in Bangladeshi factories, as global demand for fast fashion dries up.\u00a0\u00a0 Warning of second wave next winter: The director of the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0has warned that another wave of coronavirus next winter could be \u201ceven more difficult\u201d than the current outbreak because it would coincide with flu season.\u00a0 A version of this story first appeared in CNN's Coronavirus: Fact Vs. Fiction newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it in your inbox every day. Britain's first virtual sitting of Parliament began with the First Secretary of State coming under intense scrutiny over the UK's jarring shortage of coronavirus testing. Dominic Raab, who is standing in for Boris Johnson while the Prime Minister recovers from Covid-19, said the government is making \"good progress\" and would meet its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. But opposition leader Keir Starmer, making his first appearance in the House of Commons since winning the Labour leadership election earlier this month, criticized the government's pace and pointed out the UK is \"way behind\" other European nations on testing. He noted that a mere 18,206 tests were carried out on Monday, with just over a week until the end of April -- to which Raab responded that the UK's capacity for tests is at 40,000 a day. \"I think it\u2019s really important that we fully understand what the First Secretary just said,\" Starmer said. \"That means that the day before yesterday, 40,000 could have been carried out, but only 18,000 tests were actually carried out.\" \"All week I\u2019ve heard from the frontline, from care workers, who are frankly desperate for tests for their residents and for themselves,\" Starmer said. \"They would expect every test to be used every day \u2026 so there\u2019s clearly a problem. Why isn\u2019t the government using all the tests available?\" Criticism over the number of tests carried out, and over shortfalls in protective equipment for health care workers, has been leveled at the government throughout its coronavirus response. Raab and Starmer, along with a handful of other MPs, were present in the chamber and sat a safe distance from each other. Most lawmakers joined the session remotely, via a video-conference service. Ukraine will extend coronavirus lockdown measures until May 11 after projections show it peaking early next month, the country\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers said Wednesday. \u201cWe need to tell people exactly when and what will be opened, and what the government\u2019s plan of action is,\u201d\u00a0a statement from President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky's office read. \u201cPeak incidence is expected in early May. People need to understand whether it will be possible to walk in the parks, go to hairdressers, notaries, lawyers and other businesses.\"\u00a0 The government was considering various options for modifying coronavirus restrictions to boost the morale of citizens and to help restart the economy, according to the statement. Female medical staff in the UK are struggling to find personal protective equipment (PPE) which fits them correctly, according to the British Medical Association (BMA). Most of the equipment is designed to fit men. \u201cIt is vital that to keep staff in clinical environments safe they have an adequate supply of PPE and that it fits correctly,\" said Dr. Helen Fidler,\u00a0deputy chair of BMA UK consultants committee.\n\u201cHowever, we are aware that in the current crisis,\u00a0female doctors and other NHS staff are having issues with filtering face piece (FFP) masks and other PPE not being available in smaller sizes as they tend to be designed to the size and shape of male bodies.\n\"This is in spite of the fact that 75% of NHS workers are women. Correctly fitted PPE is essential for the protection of staff and patients and smaller sizes need to be made available urgently.\u201d The Indian government has introduced an urgent executive order to discourage violence against health workers. The country's Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, has been amended, and those found guilty now face imprisonment from 6 months to 7 years. \"Health workers who are trying to save the country from this epidemic are unfortunately facing attacks. No incident of violence or harassment against them will be tolerated. An ordinance has been brought in, it'll be implemented after President's sanction,\" Union Minister P Javadekar said.\n\"Such crime will now be cognizable and non-bailable. Investigation will be done in 30 days.\" Earlier in the day, the Indian Medical Association withdrew its two-day protest, following a video conference with India\u2019s Home Minister Amit Shah and Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. The protesting doctors demanded an urgent law to protect the healthcare workers from violent attacks. ##Health## Two coronavirus-related deaths confirmed in Northern California's Santa Clara County\u00a0from early February are the earliest known deaths from the virus in the US. The deaths were from February 6 and February 17 -- up to three weeks before the first known US death in Kirkland, Washington, on February 29. A third death in early March was also confirmed to be virus-related, the statement said. \"Testing criteria set by the CDC at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms,\" a spokesperson for the county said. Further details on the victims were not provided.

Speaking in Parliament Wednesday, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced the change in the relaxation of restrictions for children. Sanchez made the statement less than a day after his government insisted that kids would only be allowed limited outings to places like supermarkets, pharmacies and banks, accompanied by an adult. The negative response to the initial decision was immediate and loud, with people across Spain showing disapproval by banging pots and pans from windows and balconies on Tuesday evening.\u00a0 Many politicians and health professionals also swiftly criticized the rules set out on Tuesday, forcing a response from the government within hours, with\u00a0Spain\u2019s Health Minister\u00a0Salvador Illa saying those rules would be adjusted to allow \u201cwalks under specific conditions.\u201d In an apparent effort to control the damage, Spain\u2019s\u00a0Prime\u00a0Minister said \u201cthis is a government that listens\u201d and recognizes the \u201ctremendous effort that the confinement has been for the young ones, as well as mothers and fathers, and families.\u201d But he added that the\u00a0\u201cexception to this small relief, which allows the young ones to go out, does not change the most important thing \u2013 the rule of general confinement that continues in place.\u201d Spain has the strictest confinement measures in Europe, and the world\u2019s second-highest number of coronavirus cases, after the United States. The Socialist Party Prime Minister was accused of mishandling the coronavirus crisis in a fiery speech in Parliament by the\u00a0conservative opposition leader, Pablo Casado, head of the Popular Party. \"You are sinning from incompetence,\" Casado said.\u00a0\u201cYou do not mess with our children. And you do not mess with the health of Spaniards.\" Sanchez made his announcement ahead of a vote in Parliament to extend Spain\u2019s state of alarm for the third time, until May\u00a09. Parliament is expected to approve the extension,\u00a0which would make the lockdown order a total of eight weeks. The Spanish\u00a0Prime\u00a0Minister said \u201cthis extension is different than the others. It is one that will begin to de-escalate the rules of confinement.\u201d As Spain looks ahead to a return to normality with the number of coronavirus cases decreasing, Sanchez warned \u201cthe return to normality will be slow and gradual, because it has to be secure.\u201d The country has been hard hit economically by the pandemic. Sanchez also emphasized the so-called new normality demands that \u201cwe must talk about the health system, revitalize the pulse of our economy, and take social protection measures. It is essential to prioritize being in line with Europe. The pacts in Spain will be the pacts in Europe. This is the new politics.\u201d The first clinical trial for a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved in Germany, the country's Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Drugs has said. The potential vaccine is being developed by biotech company BioNTech in Mainz, Germany. The Paul Ehrlich Institute, the Federal Agency, says it was able to complete the approval process in four days. Another human vaccine trial is set to get underway at Oxford University in the UK on Thursday, the British health secretary confirmed this week. And a separate trial at London's Imperial College is also in the pipeline for June, with researchers asking for volunteers. At least 825,306 people in the United States have been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. The total includes 45,075 deaths. As states begin to include \u201cprobable deaths\u201d in their counts, so will John Hopkins. In the upcoming days, these reporting changes may look like surges of deaths in the United States. CNN is tracking US coronavirus cases here: https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/ ##Health## The world is facing multiple famines of \"biblical proportions\" in just a matter of months, the UN has said, warning that the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic\u00a0will push an additional 130 million people to the brink of starvation. Famines could take hold in \"about three dozen countries\" in a worst-case scenario, the executive director of the World Food Programme (WFP) said in a stark address on Tuesday. Ten of those countries already have more than 1 million people on the verge of starvation, he said. He cited conflict, an economic recession, a decline in aid and a collapse in oil prices as factors likely to lead to\u00a0vast food shortages, and urged swift action to avert disaster. \"While dealing with a Covid-19 pandemic, we are also on the brink of a hunger pandemic,\" David Beasley told the UN's security council. \"There is also a real danger that more people could potentially die from the economic impact of Covid-19 than from the virus itself.\" \u201cWe are not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cMillions of civilians living in\u00a0conflict-scarred nations, including many women and children,\u00a0face being pushed to the brink of starvation, with the specter of famine a very real and dangerous possibility.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no famines yet.\u00a0But\u00a0I must\u00a0warn you that if we don\u2019t prepare and act now\u00a0-- to secure access,\u00a0avoid funding shortfalls and disruptions\u00a0to trade\u00a0--\u00a0we\u00a0could\u00a0be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months,\u201d he said. The WFP had already warned that 2020 would be a devastating year for numerous countries ravaged by poverty or war, with 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse. Their updated projections nearly double that number.

The community-wide free testing effort in Bolinas, California, is voluntary. The town is one of two communities taking part in the new study launched by the University of California, San Francisco with the aim of gaining a more complete understanding of how the virus invisibly spread during the initial\u00a0shortfall of comprehensive nationwide testing. Bolinas, with a population of fewer than 2,000 people, sits idyllically on the Pacific Ocean in rural Marin County, just north of San Francisco. Starting this past Monday, residents of this picturesque town have four days to visit a pop-up testing site to receive nasal swabs for Covid-19 infection, as well as submit for a finger prick to test for antibodies.  Five days later, beginning on April 25, and in an entirely different location, nearly 6,000 residents of a section of the densely inhabited Mission District in San Francisco will have four days of their own in which to take advantage of the testing.

An RAF plane carrying some of the PPE landed in England on Wednesday \u2013 several days after it was due to arrive. \u00dcmit Yal\u00e7\u0131n said the Turkish government was only approached by the UK on Sunday to help facilitate the export of PPE, which was acquired through a commercial contract. \u201cWhen we were approached, we immediately reacted positively,\u201d Yal\u00e7\u0131n told BBC radio.\n\u201cI can assure you that the reason for the delay is not because of the Turkish government or Turkish authorities \u2013 we have done what is necessary and we have done what we have been requested.\u201d ##Health## When Fatema Akther arrived for work at the Alif Casual Wear\u00a0garment factory\u00a0in Dhaka in late March, she had no idea it would be her last day. \"My line chief came and told me that I didn't have to work anymore,\" said Akther, 25, who had been employed there for five years. She said the company, which could not be reached for comment, decided to close the factory, leaving her without a source of income past March. The\u00a0coronavirus pandemic\u00a0has led factories to furlough or lay off more than half of the country's nearly 4.1 million garment workers, according to estimates from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). Like Akther, most of them are women, and the roughly $110 they earn every month is often their families' only source of money. \"My family runs on my single income,\" said Akther, who said she provides for her husband and child. \"I don't know how my family will survive.\" Global lockdowns and unprecedented job losses have caused demand for just about anything that isn't food to evaporate, including clothing. That's led the international apparel brands and retailers who rely on the cheap labor that Bangladesh provides to cancel or suspend an estimated $3.17 billion worth of orders in the country,\u00a0according to BGMEA.

A team at Imperial College London has been carrying out tests on animals since February and has secured government funding to fast-track its work. \u201cWe are looking for volunteers to take part in our trial in June -- they will be the first volunteers to get the vaccine,\u201d Professor Robin Shattock\u00a0told BBC radio. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be studying what doses give us the best type of immune response and are free from showing any sort of tolerability issues.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s always an element of risk in any clinical trial, but we try to remove those elements and minimize them as much as possible.\u201d The college said early findings show that in animals, the vaccine does have a positive effect. Shattock\u00a0said the coronavirus is not as difficult a target compared with other diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from influenza, which changes every year,\u201d he said. \u201cScientifically there\u2019s a very high chance of success of getting a vaccine.\u201d  \u00a0##Health## More than 10,000 people in Singapore have contracted the novel coronavirus, authorities in the city-state said Wednesday.

They are resting at home. ##Health## The novel coronavirus has now infected more than 2.56 million people and killed at least 177,500 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. Here's what you may have missed if you're just tuning in: Missouri is suing China: In what could be the first lawsuit filed by a US state against China, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the loss of life and economic consequences in Missouri from the coronavirus, according to a statement from Schmitt\u2019s office.\u00a0 The lawsuit was filed against the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party and other Chinese institutions accusing the government of suppressing information, arresting whistleblowers and denying the \"contagious nature\" of Covid-19, leading to severe consequences in Missouri.\u00a0 Pope prays for Europe: Pope Francis prayed for European unity during early morning mass from the chapel of his residence on Wednesday. His words come ahead of an EU Council meeting Thursday to discuss a recovery package for the economic crisis the bloc is experiencing due to the pandemic. Another cruise ship cluster: Japan has confirmed that 33 additional crew members onboard the Costa Atlantica cruise ship, which is docked in Nagasaki prefecture, have tested positive for Covid-19. The ship, operated by Italian cruise liner Costa Crociere, has been docked in Japan since March for repairs with 623 crew members. No passengers are currently onboard the ship. Ai Weiwei on coronavirus: The Chinese artist and dissident said Beijing's alleged selective handing of information early on provided a \"chance for the virus to spread.\" However, understanding China's motivations is as important to Ai as the alleged cover-up, or the suggestion that the country's infection numbers and fatalities have been under-reported. More concerns about winter: The director of South Korea's CDC believes that it is likely the country will see a second wave of the pandemic in autumn or winter \"unless herd immunity is achieved through natural spread or through vaccines.\" Her comments follow similar warnings from the director of the US CDC. All public gatherings have been banned in Harbin, the capital of China's northernmost Heilongjiang province, after an uptick in novel coronavirus cases were recorded in the city.  Seven locally transmitted infections were recorded in Heilongjiang on Tuesday, according to China's National Health Commission, prompting authorities to ramp up social restrictions. The provincial government said in a statement that all 10 million-plus residents of the city will only be allowed to socialize with people in their respective households. Currently, there are 54 reported coronavirus cases in Heilongjiang province. Of the 54, a total of 52 cases are from Harbin. Harbin is located about 300 miles (480 kilometers) northwest of Suifenhe, a Chinese city on the Russian border where a spike in cases was reported last week. ##Daily Life## Pope Francis has prayed for European unity during early morning mass from the chapel of his residence on Wednesday. \"In this time in which so much unity is needed, among us, among the nations, we pray today for Europe, so that Europe will have this unity, this fraternal unity that the founding fathers of the European Union have dreamed of,\" Pope Francis said.

The man was arrested on suspicion of domestic assault on a woman and criminal damage to her property on Monday. Met Police said the man told authorities he had Covid-19 and while being put into a police van, he spat at two officers. He was later charged for assault on emergency workers in addition to assaulting the woman. While in custody, police said the suspect told them he did not have coronavirus or any symptoms. He appeared in custody at Barkingside Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, where he pleaded guilty and was sentenced. \"I hope he spends his period in prison to reflect on his behavior, and that his prison sentence sends a message to others who are willing to commit domestic offenses and to target police officers whose job it is to protect Londoners,\" police inspector Alexis Manley said in a statement. Jung Eun-kyeong, the director of South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, believes that it is likely the country will see a second wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic. \"Unless herd immunity is achieved through natural spread or through vaccines, come autumn or winter season, because most of the people do not have immunity, there is a likely possibility,\" Jung said. South Korea's response to the pandemic has been hailed as one of the world's best, in large part due to a massive push by health officials to conduct widespread testing.  At least 10,694 people have contracted the virus in the country, killing 238, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Jung also revealed the preliminary results of a study on retesting positive cases. In the six tests completed so far, the virus did not separate during the cultivation study.  \"We understand that the contagiousness is either zero or very low,\" Jung said.

The community-wide free testing effort in Bolinas, California, is voluntary. The town is one of two communities taking part in the new study launched by the University of California, San Francisco, with the aim of gaining a more complete understanding of how the virus invisibly spread during the initial shortfall of comprehensive nationwide testing. Testing began in Bolinas -- a town of fewer than 2,000 people -- on Monday, and residents have four days to visit a pop-up center to receive nasal swabs and a finger prick test.  On Saturday, April 25, the second community, the vastly different and densely populated Mission District of San Francisco, will begin testing, with some 6,000 residents having four days to get their swabs and jabs.  More than 700 people have been tested in Bolinas so far, according to venture capitalist Jyri Engestrom, one of those responsible for making the project a reality.  Along with donations from several tech entrepreneurs, a GoFundMe page was launched to help raise the approximately $400,000 needed for the operation. Engestrom notes that 93% of the over 150 donors on GoFundMe donated less than $5,000, and said they have raised around $300,000 to date. The study is led by a team of researchers from the UCSF Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. \u201cAll our public health decisions, including when it will be possible to relax regional and statewide shelter-in-place orders, are driven by rough assumptions about how this virus behaves based on very limited data,\u201d said Bryan Greenhouse, an associate professor of medicine at UCSF and a CZ Biohub Investigator. \u201cStudying in detail how the virus has spread in these two distinctive communities will give us crucial data points that we can extrapolate to better predict how to control the virus in similar communities nationwide.\u201d ##Health## The Indian Council of Medical Research has advised all states to discontinue the usage of rapid test kits for the next two days after some of them were revealed to be defective. The council is sending teams to validate kits already in use so they can assess which ones are faulty and trace them back to the manufacturers.  Raman R Gangakhedkar, the head of the council, said positive samples were showing \"too much variation\" and required investigating. The rapid testing kits were deployed in India last week. The health ministry has repeatedly said that the kits should be used only for surveillance and to determine epidemiological trends.  India had tested a  total of 462,621 samples from 447,812 individuals as of April 21, according to the council.\u00a0 ##Health## Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, China has struggled to control the narrative around its role in the crisis. Is Beijing a noble victim, ably controlling an unforeseeable viral outbreak and now\u00a0assisting other countries\u00a0in their own efforts, or the villain, ultimately to blame for the misery spreading around the world? Considerable effort has been expended in pushing the first line. China has donated large amounts of medical supplies to parts of Europe and Africa. China's state media, which has an\u00a0outsized influence in much of the developing world, has also played up praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) and others of its response to and recovery from the initial outbreak, in stark contrast to many parts of the world now struggling to cope. The coronavirus crisis presents a key opportunity for China to solidify its status as a superpower and global leader, particularly as the United States has struggled to contain the outbreak, and US President Donald Trump has alienated some allies with his \"America first\" approach to the crisis. At the same time, however, Beijing has not been able to avoid intense scrutiny and criticism -- mainly, but not solely from Washington -- over how initial delays in the country's response may have squandered vital opportunities to contain the now global pandemic, as well as skepticism over its reporting of coronavirus figures and the country's recovery. Read the full analysis: Lockdowns restricting travel and industry imposed to halt the spread of\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0have resulted in unprecedented reductions in deadly air pollution around the world, new analysis shows. Major cities that suffer from the world's worst air pollution have seen reductions of deadly particulate matter by up to 60% from the previous year, during a three-week lockdowns period. Researchers from IQAir -- a global air quality information and tech company -- studied 10 major cities around the world which have relatively high numbers of coronavirus cases and Covid-19 lockdown measures. The study compared levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5. The pollutant, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream, causing serious health risks. Seven out of the 10 cities studied, including New Delhi, Seoul, Wuhan and Mumbai, saw significant improvements in air quality. Those with historically higher levels of PM2.5 pollution witnessed the most substantial drops in pollution.

It's the lowest the rating has been since Pew began to survey attitudes to China in 2005. According to the survey, just 26% of Americans said that they had a \"positive\" attitude to China, down from 44% in 2017. Back then only 47% said that they had an \"unfavorable\" view of China. That figure is now 66%. There was only a small bipartisan split, with 72% of Republicans and 62% of Democrats saying they had a negative view of the country. The survey was conducted between March 3 and March 29, just as the novel coronavirus was beginning to spread rapidly through the United States. According to Pew, the results also found: 91% of Americans said it was best if the US remain the world's leading power\n71% said they had no confidence in China's leader Xi Jinping\n62% said that they viewed China's power and influence as a \"major threat\" In what could be the first lawsuit filed by a state against China, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the loss of life and economic consequences in Missouri from the coronavirus, according to a statement from Schmitt\u2019s office.\u00a0 The lawsuit was filed against the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party and other Chinese institutions accusing the government of suppressing information, arresting whistleblowers and denying the \"contagious nature\" of Covid-19, leading to severe consequences in Missouri.\u00a0 \"COVID-19 has done irreparable damage to countries across the globe, causing sickness, death, economic disruption, and human suffering. In Missouri, the impact of the virus is very real - thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table,\" Schmitt\u2019s statement reads.\u00a0\"The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease. They must be held accountable for their actions.\"\u00a0 The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and alleges \"during the critical weeks of the initial outbreak, Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment -- thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.\" The lawsuit alleges that Chinese officials did little to contain the spread of the virus despite having knowledge of the disease. It also alleges the government denied the potential of human-to-human transmission when it informed the World Health Organization about the outbreak, despite having evidence of such transmission.\u00a0 \"The lawsuit notes the immense negative impact that COVID-19 has had on Missourians, pointing out the unprecedented number of jobless claims, the impact on Missouri's unemployment rate, and the impact on the State's budget now and in the future. On the human side - Missouri\u2019s nurses and doctors are forced to quarantine from their families, our elderly citizens are stuck in nursing homes away from loved ones, and more,\" the statement reads, adding, \"The lawsuit seeks relief on one count of public nuisance, one count of abnormally dangerous activities, and two counts of breach of duty. Remedies could include civil penalties and restitution, abatement of the public nuisance, cessation of abnormally dangerous activities, punitive damages, and more.\"\u00a0 Missouri has at least 6,105 cases of the virus and at least 229 deaths related to it, according to numbers from Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0 CNN has reached out to the Chinese government for comment.\u00a0 Legal experts have said the lawsuit faces an uphill battle because China is protected by sovereign immunity.\u00a0 \u00a0##Health## As the world grapples with unprecedented lockdown measures, Ai Weiwei finds himself in familiar territory. The outspoken artist spent nearly three months in a tiny room while detained by authorities in China in 2011. He was later\u00a0accused\u00a0of tax evasion, a charge widely interpreted as punishment for his political activism. Following his release, Ai's passport was confiscated, and he was placed under\u00a0close surveillance\u00a0in Beijing. In Cambridge, England, where the 62-year-old dissident now resides, self-isolation has stirred similar feelings of solitude. \"You (feel) disassociated, you're dysfunctioning and you're uncertain about your own future ... you're trying to imagine behaving in relation to others,\" he said, over the phone, of restrictions implemented to contain the\u00a0coronavirus. Ai has been critical of China's handling of the outbreak: According to Ai, China's selective handing of information early on provided a \"chance for the virus to spread.\" However, understanding China's motivations is as important to Ai as the alleged cover-up, or the suggestion that the country's infection numbers and fatalities have been under-reported. \"The West's blame is very superficial,\" said Ai. \"They (in the West) only talk about China practically -- (that it) doesn't release information.

They are believed to be the first coronavirus-related fatalities in the United States. The first death connected to a nursing home in Washington state -- the first major cluster in the US -- was recorded on February 29 The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner performed autopsies on two individuals who died in their residences in February and sent samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a statement from the county. Results from the CDC came back today, confirming both tissue samples tested positive for the coronavirus, the statement said. The individuals were not tested because they died when coronavirus testing was very limited and was only available through the CDC. \"Testing criteria set by the CDC at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms,\" the statement said. ##Health## A resident of Indian President Ram Nath Kovind\u2019s official estate has tested positive for Covid-19, leading to the quarantine of 115 families who live in the residential section of the Rashtrapati Bhavan -- the presidential palace in New Delhi.  The individual who has tested positive is a family member of an employee who is currently working in the palace and lives on the premises. Following current guidelines, the whole family was moved to a quarantine facility, according to a news release issued by the palace.  The family was located during contact tracing of another deceased patient by health officials. \"Subsequently, one of the family members who was in contact with the deceased, tested positive. All other family members including the employee of the President's Secretariat have tested negative,\" the news release said.

The eight cars were mostly full, with train attendants checking passengers\u2019 temperatures twice during the 4-hour\u00a0high-speed journey. Foreigners faced additional questioning onboard:  Where are you originally from? \nHow long have you been in China? \nMay I please check your passport to verify your date of entry into the country? With the local epidemic contained, Chinese officials are now concerned with a rise in imported cases.\u00a0 The train stations in Wuhan were shuttered for more than two months beginning from January 23. Now when you arrive in Wuhan, most passengers are able to walk off the train and exit the railway station freely.  However, security in white protective suits once again single out those who appear to be foreign. The screeners look through passports and ask for other official documentation to prove how long you\u2019ve been in the country. Passengers unable to provide such documents will be subject to forced government quarantine for a minimum of 14 days, according to the screeners. On the streets, Wuhan still appears to be awakening from its 76-day lockdown. When you enter a Wuhan hotel, there\u2019s another screening. The hotel staff ask to see each guest\u2019s updated city QR code -- a color-coded digital bar code that cities use for tracing potential exposures of the virus -- to verify you\u2019re clean to enter.\u00a0 In addition to taking the temperature of guests, they also: Provide a sanitation mat for shoes.\nUse a pesticide-like bottle to spray sanitizer on clothing worn by guests and their luggage. \nInside the elevator, there are \u201cstand here\u201d stickers on the floor so as to keep guests separated to the four corners. \nThere are even tissues and a trashcan so that no one presses a button with their bare finger. \nThroughout the hotel, there are sanitation stations every few feet.\u00a0 The measures may seem extreme, but with more than 11 million people, Wuhan\u00a0is a city larger than New York City that is still shell-shocked from its devastating outbreak, and trying to navigate the new normal that follows a 76-day halting of life.\u00a0 Watch: ##Daily Life## ##Travel## Japan has confirmed that 33 additional crew members onboard the Costa Atlantica cruise ship, which is docked in Nagasaki prefecture, have tested positive for novel coronavirus on Wednesday.

If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments: More money to fight the pandemic: The US Senate approved a roughly $480 billion relief package with funds for small business, hospitals and testing. It comes on the heels of several other massive stimuli passed by Congress: a $2 trillion rescue package, a $192 billion relief measure and another $8.3 billion plan approved last month. Democratic leaders are already planning for another massive rescue bill.\nWorries about flu season: The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the coronavirus outbreak could be \"even more difficult\" next winter because it would coincide with flu season.\u00a0\nNew information about the virus:\u00a0The novel coronavirus lingers for as long as three weeks in the bodies of patients with severe disease, Chinese researchers reported. The virus can be found deep in the lungs and in the stool of patients, and the sicker they are, the longer it stays, the team at a hospital in China\u2019s Zhejiang province reported. \nHolidays on hold: Indonesia has banned all citizens from traveling to their hometowns for Eid al-Fitr celebrations in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Millions of people traditionally make the annual trip to see their families.\nItaly's plan to fight the virus: The country's prime minister unveiled a five-point plan to handle the coronavirus outbreak that will include social distancing, reinforcing the country's beleaguered health care system and contact tracing. Health officials in California are now recommending coronavirus testing for asymptomatic people who live or work in high-risk environments like nursing homes and hospitals, according to new guidelines from the California Department of Public Health. The move, announced in an April 19 memo to public health departments and others, makes California the first state in the nation to broaden its guidelines for testing to include asymptomatic people, state health officials told CNN. The updated guidelines from the CDPH says the testing of asymptomatic people who work or live in high-risk settings such as nursing homes and prisons is now considered to be a top priority, along with hospitalized patients and symptomatic health care workers. Standards vary across the United States when it comes to who can and can\u2019t get a coronavirus test. But while most of the country has focused on testing patients who are already sick, California is describing itself as a pioneer in recommending tests for people without any symptoms at all, so long as they\u2019re in high-risk settings. According to a CDPH spokesperson, the previous guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was to test high-risk patients with symptoms and health care workers with symptoms. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the state is currently averaging 14,500 coronavirus tests a day, but said that number \"is still inadequate to ultimately get to where we need to go.\u201d  Newsom said that the state must expand testing before it can begin to reopen.

The city is handling more than 100 burials a day due to coronavirus, according to the office of Manaus Mayor Arthur Virgilio Neto. Before the spread of the disease, the average was 30 burials a day. The department responsible for burials in the city started to dig trenches to carry out the burials of Covid-19 victims. This practice is used by other countries and preserves the identities of the bodies, with distance between the coffins and the respective identifications. \"The measure was necessary to meet the demand for burials in the capital,\"  Virgilio Neto's office said in a statement. In an interview with CNN Brasil Tuesday evening, Virgilio Neto said the health system is no longer able to serve those who need treatment and people have started to die at home. \"Although we are living in such a critical situation, probably the most serious in Brazil, we have not received any help from the federal government to expand our specialized medical care at the city\u2019s field hospital,\" he said. ##Health## At least 824,438 people in the United States have been diagnosed with Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases.

Millions of people normally go back to their hometowns to see their families every year in a homecoming tradition known as \"mudik,\" the report said. Jokowi did not provide specifics on how the ban will be enforced. The President also said the decision was taken to curb travel after a recent government study showed the majority of the population did not intend to return home for the festival. However, around 24% of Indonesians were still planning to make the journey, Antara reported. Indonesia has recorded more than 7,000 coronavirus cases and at least 616 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. This post was updated to reflect that Jokowi did not provide specifics on enforcement of the ban. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that US President Donald Trump agreed to take ownership of the national supply chain to get coronavirus testing kit manufacturers the supplies they need to produce kits The problem with bringing testing up to scale is the national manufacturers who make the testing kits and send them to state labs, Cuomo said. Those companies say they have a problem with the supply chain getting swabs, vials and chemicals to produce the testing kits, Cuomo added. The governor said his meeting at the White House was \u201cvery productive, positive, got a lot done.\" Some of the meeting focused on the importance of dividing the responsibilities between states and federal government to scale up testing, he said. The state will be responsible for managing diagnostic and antibody testing, who to test, where to test and tracing cases, Cuomo said. The goal is to double New York State\u2019s testing from 20,000 diagnostic tests to 40,000 diagnostic and antibody tests, he said. \u201cIt will take several weeks at best, this is an enormous undertaking,\u201d Cuomo added. ##Health## As several states make plans for reopening their communities during the coronavirus pandemic, a group of top public health experts cautioned Tuesday against reopening society before testing capacity expands significantly. Different parts of the country are in different stages of the epidemic, with New York well into the first wave and other places just beginning to see the impact of the disease. This matters, said Dr. Caroline Buckee, Harvard associate professor of epidemiology and the associate director of the university\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.\u00a0 Knowing the location of the virus is key to relaxing social distancing and returning to normalcy, Buckee told a symposium sponsored by Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the New England Journal of Medicine. The lack of testing capacity is a big problem because the disease has \u201ca very broad clinical spread,\u201d Buckee said. So even when people show up at the hospital and get tested there are many more cases in the community, including mild and asymptomatic cases. \u201cAnd those are the people that are spreading the disease,\u201d she said. It\u2019s important to learn whether people who have recovered can still spread the disease, noted NEJM editor Dr. Eric Rubin.  \u201cWhat we really need is some epidemiological data to tell us, 'Are people who have left the hospital going on to transmit the disease?'\u201d Rubin said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the shoe leather epidemiology, contact tracing, following what happens to the context of those patients, which takes some manpower.\u00a0 Buckee added that without knowing the answers, the nation could reopen too soon and risk a deadly second pandemic wave. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have good estimates for where we are on the epidemic curve in different places. So, discussions of relaxation of physical distance, which do seem to be having an effect, curbing some of the worst impacts of the outbreak, need to be based on the capacity to test people so we know where we are,\u201d she said. ##Daily Life## ##Business## The novel coronavirus lingers for as long as three weeks in the bodies of patients with severe disease, Chinese researchers reported Tuesday. The virus can be found deep in the lungs and in the stool of patients, and the sicker they are, the longer it stays, the team at a hospital in China\u2019s Zhejiang province reported. But the virus was found in the urine of patients less than half the time, and rarely in the blood at first.\u00a0 Their report provides another piece of evidence about the pattern of disease in Covid-19 patients. It was published in the BMJ. Unlike many recently released studies\u00a0about the coronavirus, this one has gone through peer review, which means other experts have reviewed the findings. The team tested 96 patients treated in their hospital for Covid-19 between January and March. They tested samples from the nose and throat, from deeper in the respiratory system, in the blood, stool and urine. They wanted to see how long people had virus in their systems and whether it was likely to spread in various ways. The findings support other studies showing that the virus could spread in stool from infected people. In\u00a0general, the sicker people were, the longer the virus could be detected. That could be important\u00a0for doctors to know, so they can predict which patients will fare better,\u00a0and, perhaps, how long they may remain infectious to others.\u00a0 \u201cThe median duration of virus in respiratory samples was 18 days,\u201d they wrote.\u00a0 More on this: An\u00a0earlier\u00a0Chinese study showed that people without symptoms had just as much virus in their noses as people who had Covid-19 symptoms -- something that indicated people who are not sick could be just as likely to spread virus as people who are. The team in Zhejiang found that sicker people had more virus deeper in their respiratory tracts, however. They also found differences between men and women with Covid-19. \u201cIn this study, we found that the duration of virus was significantly longer in men than in women,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOur results shed light on the causes of disease severity in men in terms of the duration of the virus. In addition to differences in immune status between men and women, it has also been reported to be related to differences in hormone levels,\u201d the team wrote. ##Health##\u00a0 Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte outlined a five-point plan for managing the coronavirus epidemic on Tuesday. Addressing Italy's house of representatives, Conte said that the plan will focus on: Continued social distancing with use of masks and gloves until a vaccine or a therapy is available.\nReinforcing the health care system, and paying special attention to care homes to \"avoid another out-of-control explosion of contagion.\"\nCreating\u00a0special Covid-19 hospitals designated to cater exclusively to coronavirus patients.\nConducting antibody testing in a large study to determine the spread of the virus among the population. Conte said 300,000 serological tests have been requested.\nContact tracing. Last week the government officially chose a contract tracing app, called Immuni, which is in the testing phase, but the choice to download it will be voluntary, Conte said. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Travel## The number of patients admitted to intensive care in France has declined for the 13th consecutive day, Jerome Salomon, the director of France's health agency, announced on Tuesday. Salomon, speaking at his daily news conference in Paris, gave an overview of where things stand now: There have so far been at least 117,324 confirmed coronavirus cases in France, including deaths and recoveries.\nAt least 30,106 patients are currently hospitalized.\nAt least 5,433 patients are in intensive care units. ##Health## The Netherlands will extend its lockdown for most businesses until May 20 and ban large events until September 1, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said during a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cAs much as I understand that impatience is creeping in, we know that a rapid easing could lead to the virus immediately getting the chance to peak again,\u201d Rutte said. The uncertainty is still \u201ctoo large\u201d for businesses that require close contact, like barbers and nail salons, he said. Primary students will begin attending school in a staggered fashion starting May 11. \u201cChildren in primary education will, to start with, go to school half of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, one half of the students will go one day and the other half will go the other day.\u201d He said that social distancing for these students is \u201cnot realistic,\u201d but that all evidence indicates that their Covid-19 risk is much lower.\u00a0 Some other primary education institutions like nurseries and special education will be able to open to students full time. ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Travel## ##Health##"], "Language": false}
