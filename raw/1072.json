Here's what was discussed:  Vaccine trials: CNN medical analyst Dr.\u00a0Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant\u00a0professor of infectious\u00a0diseases, said it is just the \"very beginning\" of a long process of\u00a0research and studies.  Reinfection: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said while \"there is no design study that\u00a0has proven that you are 'protected'\" from getting reinfected, \"projecting what we know about\u00a0viruses, I would say that there\u00a0is a very good chance that you're\u00a0protected.\" Young people need to take pandemic seriously: \"We\u00a0are getting more and more\u00a0information that someone can\u00a0transmit even when they are\u00a0asymptomatic.\u00a0So in order to protect oneself,\u00a0society and particularly the\u00a0vulnerable people, we've really got to\u00a0adhere to the physical\u00a0separation,\" said Fauci.  Increased contact tracing can help save lives: Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program said that,\u00a0\"it is possible to do contact\u00a0tracing even under the most\u00a0difficult circumstances, but it\u00a0does require a real scale-up in\u00a0public health capacity.\" Assessing your own mental health: Psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer\u00a0 likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find \"coping strategies\" to keep their stress levels down. ##Town Hall## Question: At CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer about the best ways for people to manage and assess there own mental health, especially considering that for many, the pandemic is not a single traumatic even but rather a long period of significant change. Answer: Schmelzer likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find \"coping strategies\" to keep their stress levels down.  \"It's important that people allow themselves to cope the way they need to,\" she said. \"This is essentially repeated trauma. This is going to go on for a while, and so people will adjust their behaviors. And they're going to have to unlearn some things when we come out of this.\" ##Daily Life## ##Town Hall## All 40 million residents in the state of California have been ordered to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.  The state is one of the worst affected in the US after Washington and New York. There are now 910 coronavirus cases in California, including 19 deaths.  New York has at least 5,298 cases, while Washington has at least 1,376 confirmed cases.  California is the most populous\u00a0US state and is the country's\u00a0largest state economy.  Watch: ##Daily Life## Question: Jackie Stephens, a 65-year-old grandmother with underlying health conditions from Idaho, wants to know how best to explain to her \"timid, easily frightened\" 3-year-old grandson that he can't come into physical contact with her.  Answer: Psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer recommended telling Stephens' grandson that \"right now, grandma needs a special bubble.\" \"Young children can understand that there is a way to stay connected, even if they can't be be held,\" Schmelzer said, though she acknowledged it is \"hard for both parties.\"  Schmelzer recommended talking and maybe reading stories to each other online through video messaging apps like Skype or Facetime.  She added that it's important the grandchildren \"are still feeling the love.\" \"There's different ways of staying connected.\"  ##Town Hall## ##Daily Life## CNN Correspondent Will Ripley is joining the town hall from Tokyo, Japan -- where a debate is ongoing on the future of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. \"In less than an hour\u00a0the Olympic Torch is going to be\u00a0arriving here in Japan.\u00a0And officials continue to insist\u00a0they're moving forward to host\u00a0the Olympics on schedule at the\u00a0end of July,\" Ripley said. \"Can the world feel confident\u00a0given, you know, we're seeing\u00a0such limited testing here?\" Will the Olympics go ahead? The coming weeks will tell: \"I have no reason to believe\u00a0they're not making progress in\u00a0Japan,\" said Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program. \"And the Olympics is a major\u00a0global event.\u00a0And I think Japan still has hope\u00a0the Olympics will happen, but\u00a0that is going to be based on a\u00a0risk management decision.\u00a0And obviously the government of\u00a0Japan will not make a decision\u00a0to go ahead if there is danger\u00a0to athletes, danger to\u00a0spectators.\u00a0And a lot of that will depend on\u00a0how the disease evolves in the\u00a0coming few weeks.\" Watch:  ##Town Hall## The Indian government has prohibited the export of masks, ventilators and raw textile materials for masks and coveralls. India's Minister of Commerce, Piyush Goyal, confirmed the news in a tweet, and said the action has been taken in a \"bid to utilize the nation\u2019s resources for the well being of Indian citizens.\" The news comes a day after the country issued fresh guidelines, banning all international commercial passenger flights from landing in\u00a0India\u00a0from March 22.  The directive will be in place for a week.\u00a0 What other measures is India taking? The\u00a0Indian government is directing state governments to advise citizens above 65 and children below 10 to stay home. This excludes public representatives, medical professionals and government employees.\u00a0 States have also been requested to enforce work from home for private sector employees, except those working in emergency or essential services. There are more than 190 confirmed cases in India and four deaths.  \u00a0 CNN's Anderson Cooper and Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta speak to Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program about the US' capacity to test for the coronavirus and do contact tracing.  Learning from Italy: \"I think other countries\u00a0really, really need to step up\u00a0and learn the lessons that are\u00a0being learned in Italy right\u00a0now.\u00a0We have to push this virus back.\u00a0It's not just enough to do\u00a0social distancing.\u00a0It's good to have that, it's\u00a0great to separate people, but we\u00a0have to be able to go after the\u00a0virus,\" Ryan said.  Tailoring responses: \"You've got 50\u00a0states.\u00a0You've got a different situation\u00a0in each of those states.\u00a0And you need to tailor the\u00a0responses in each of those\u00a0states.\u00a0And if you've got a chance you\u00a0need to go after the virus.\u00a0And contact tracing and\u00a0isolation of cases is still a\u00a0strategy that can be used,\" Ryan said.  Question on problems with testing in US: \"If you don't test people, you don't\u00a0know they're positive.\u00a0Therefore, they may be positive\u00a0and you don't have time to\u00a0contact trace them because you\u00a0don't know they have it,\" Cooper said.  Need to identify cases: \"It's really important we\u00a0identify all confirmed cases.\u00a0We need to test suspected cases.\u00a0We need those cases to be\u00a0isolated, and it is difficult in\u00a0a very intense environment.\u00a0It's difficult to do the kind of\u00a0detailed contact tracing.\u00a0In Ebola, at the peak of the\u00a0outbreak, we were tracing 25,000\u00a0contacts a day in the middle of\u00a0a war zone.\u00a0It is possible to do contact\u00a0tracing even under the most\u00a0difficult circumstances, but it\u00a0does require a real scale-up in\u00a0public health capacity.\u00a0And where that can be done and\u00a0the virus can be pushed back, we\u00a0can save lives,\" Ryan said.  ##Town Hall## CNN's Dan Simon and Gary Tuchman joined the coronavirus town hall from San Francisco and Georgia's St. Simons Island. Things were very different in the two locations. The scene in San Francisco: \"What police are looking for, is\u00a0they want voluntary compliance.\u00a0And I have to tell you, for the\u00a0most part, they're getting it,\" Simon said.  The city's busiest districts and streets are very empty. People can go outside to get groceries or grab fresh air -- as some were seen doing behind Simon on the city's shoreline looking out toward the Golden Gate Bridge.  The scene in St. Simons: Things are much different in Georgia's beach towns, which are  popular spring break destinations, according to Tuchman.  Bars and restaurants were still open tonight.  \"The major partying will take place after 10-11 o'clock tonight. And the beaches, they are crowded,\" Tuchman said.  Tuchman said a minority of beachgoers were attempting to distance themselves, but most were not. \"It's not just college students. There were also families, children, and I saw many people in their 70s and 80s,\" he said.  Watch: ##Town Hall## ##Daily Life## The 2020 Daytime Emmy Awards are canceled, according to a release from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The Academy's chairman Terry O\u2019Reilly announced the decision in a letter to members, saying: \u201cToday, I am writing to let you know that we have made the hard decision to cancel this year\u2019s Daytime EMMY Awards.\u201d\u00a0 O\u2019Reilly said his team is \u201cworking on alternative ideas to celebrate those who would normally have received their EMMYs.\u201d The awards were due to be held in June. ##Business## The state of Illinois can now test more than 1,000 people a day for coronavirus, the state's governor J.B. Pritzker said in a press conference Thursday afternoon. In a few days, they'll be able to do more than 2,000, he said.   As the state\u2019s testing abilities grow, the governor expects the case count will continue to grow. \u201cThe tests are only discovering people who have the virus,\u201d Pritzker said. More than 420 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the state, and four have died.  Addressing what he called \u201crumors,\" Pritzker said,\u00a0\u201cessential services will not close, interstates, highways and bridges will stay open.\u201d \u201cGrocery stories, pharmacies and gas stations will continue to operate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will never shut these services down.\u201d\u00a0 The Mexican ambassador to the US, Martha Barcena, said Thursday that she was self-quarantining after meeting with Republican congressman Mario Diaz-Balart last week. This week, Diaz Balart became one of the first members of Congress to test positive for coronavirus.  Barcena said she took the Covid-19 test today and feels fine.  \u00a0 CNN's town hall on the coronavirus, addressing facts, fears, and medical guidance, is just over halfway through -- it will run until 10 p.m. ET. We're covering the town hall here with live updates -- but you can also stream it live. Where can I watch it? The town hall will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN.com, across mobile devices via CNN's apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps, and on Facebook.  ##Town Hall## The executive director of the United Nations' World Food Programme says he has coronavirus. David Beasley tweeted a statement confirming the diagnosis. \"I began feeling unwell this past weekend after returning to my home in the United States from an official visit to Canada and I took an early decision to go into self-quarantine, five days ago,\" he said in the statement.\n\"So far, my symptoms have been relatively light, and I am in good spirits. I am lucky to be close to my family and I have access to excellent medical support.\" He said he was tracing back who he may have had contact with before he was aware of his infection. Life must go on and the World Food Programme must continue to do the work that makes all of us so proud as we bring food assistance to the many millions across the world who depend on us for help. I have a strong team of leaders around me and I have an incredible team of staff members in more than 80 countries around the globe. I am certain that you will continue to step up and do what needs to be done while I recover. Discussion on CNN's coronavirus town hall has moved to a vaccine trial in the US that gave the first dose to its first participant on Monday.  CNN medical analyst Dr.\u00a0Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant\u00a0professor of infectious\u00a0diseases, said it is just the \"very beginning\" of a long process of\u00a0research and studies.  \"I want to emphasize that these\u00a0are candidate experimental\u00a0vaccines.\u00a0We do not know if they work\u00a0or if they are safe yet.\u00a0There is a whole process to\u00a0determine whether a vaccine is\u00a0safe and effective.\u00a0 Different phases: \"Those studies are done over the\u00a0course of months.\u00a0You are going to look at people\u00a0who get the vaccine, don't get\u00a0the vaccine, and among those\u00a0who get it, do you see lower rates\u00a0of infection?\u00a0That means it needs to be done\u00a0in the context of a community\u00a0transmission, among communities\u00a0of risk. A long process: \"That will not happen\u00a0overnight, it takes time, and\u00a0it's a process.\u00a0When Dr. Fauci says we are\u00a0looking at 18 months for a\u00a0proven vaccine, that is really\u00a0fast if we can achieve that.\" ##Town Hall## Question: Zofia Scully, a communications executive, asked if someone who works in a restaurant has the virus -- but is not aware they have it -- then comes in contact with the food or the packaging, is it then possible for the person receiving the food to catch the virus? Answer: CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Dr. Celine Gounder, a CNN medical analyst and professor at New York University, both agreed that the biggest risk is contracting the virus from whoever is delivering the food. \"You're not going to get it from the food,\" Gupta said. Gupta said when he and his family have been ordering food, they've been taking it out of the packaging on the porch, wiping down any surfaces of any remaining packaging, then washing their hands. Gounder said the \"highest-risk\" moment is the \"face-to-face\" interaction.  \"Ideally, you would be able to pay them online, tip them online on whatever platform you're using for ordering food and then have them leave it outside your door,\" she said. Why this matters: Restaurants around the globe have closed their doors, either voluntarily or due to orders from government. Many have switched to a delivery-only model and use third-party services like Uber Eats or Deliveroo. Some of them are now offering users the option of asking delivery people to leave the food outside their doors. Watch: ##Town Hall## Two people from Vermont who tested positive for the coronavirus have died, the state\u2019s governor and health commissioner announced. Both died Thursday and were \u201cvery elderly,\u201d Health Commissioner Mark Levine said. They were the first coronavirus-related deaths in the state. One was from Windsor County and treated at the Veterans Affairs Hospital, officials said. The woman lived at The Burlington Health and Rehab nursing home. \u201cThere is no doubt this is sad for all of us, but it\u2019s not unexpected news,\u201d Governor Phil Scott said.\n\u201cI know some are feeling very scared, worried, overwhelmed,\u201d Scott added. \u201cI want you all to know we will get through this. At times like this, Vermonters rise to the occasion, we help our neighbors and we get creative. We will get through this and we will do it together.\u201d When asked about whether Vermont has enough hospital beds, ventilators and other medical equipment to deal with a possible surge of patients in the future, Levine noted, \u201cIf there\u2019s a scenario we\u2019re planning for, it\u2019s a worst-case scenario.\u201d \u201cThese deaths -- and I hope we will experience no more -- highlight how extremely important it is for all of\u00a0us, young and old, to take extra care to protect those most vulnerable to serious illness,\u201d Levine added. More than 20 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in Vermont. The number of Californians being ordered to stay home has risen to more than 21 million people. On Thursday evening, Los Angeles County officials told more than\u00a010 million\u00a0residents to stay home. When added to the roughly 11 million Californians under similar orders, it brings the total number to more than 21 million. That means more than half of all Californians are now living under what equates to a shelter in place order. The revised emergency order -- dubbed \"Safer at Home\" -- goes into effect at midnight. Those restrictions will not apply to emergency workers and food workers. But it does mean that all non-essential businesses are being closed. LA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger had no estimate on how long the restrictions would last, but assured the public that this is only temporary. \"What we do, and how we do it, and if we get this right, will determine how long this crisis lasts,\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The Mexican and Israeli foreign ministers tweeted on Thursday that their respective nationals were on special flights exiting Peru. Peru announced a sudden border closure on Sunday that left many foreigners stranded. Peru has 234 reported coronavirus cases and one confirmed death. On Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz tweeted a video showing a cheering group of passengers, many wearing face masks, aboard a plane in Lima. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard retweeted Subsecretary Maximiliano\u00a0Reyes\u00a0Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who wrote that a flight from Lima to Mexico City took off late on Thursday with 154 passengers aboard. The situation for Americans: Meanwhile, Americans stranded in Peru have been calling on US authorities for help. A Google spreadsheet maintained by a user who says her father is among the passengers stranded in Peru currently has more than 1,600 entries for stranded Americans. Here's what President Donald Trump said about the Americans currently stuck in Peru at a news conference on Thursday:\u00a0 \u201cWe're trying to get them out. And, you know, they got caught. They were late with their flights. We gave them a period of time. They didn't make it, but we're looking to get them out with military, probably through the military.\u201d Another way out? However, information on the US Embassy in Lima\u2019s website appears to suggest that private airline carriers could take the stranded Americans home. The Embassy published a link to an Avianca Airlines signup page for passengers in need of international flights and wrote that anyone interested in the offer \u201cshould respond immediately.\u201d The Embassy also listed phone numbers for major airlines that operate flights between Peru and the United States. American students stranded in Cusco, Peru told CNN on Thursday that they are eager for the US State Department to assist them in returning home. \u201cBring us home,\u201d student Erin Hill told CNN: \u201cThank you (State Department) for the work and hours you\u2019re putting in. Everybody here wants to get home.\u201d ##Travel## Four unaccompanied children have been tested for coronavirus, according to the US Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the federal agency tasked with the care of migrant children. Two of the children tested negative, and two tests are pending, the agency said. The office is also limiting the placement of unaccompanied children in New York, adding that a staff member of a New York program tested positive.\u00a0 \u201cORR has stopped all intakes at the facility, and is notifying any staff that may have been exposed,\u201d the statement says. \u201cORR\u2019s medical team is working with the affected program and will provide internal updates on any developments, and if there is a need for additional actions.\u201d\u00a0 There are approximately 3,600 unaccompanied children in ORR custody. ORR stopped placement of children in California and Washington last week. \u201cThe situation remains extremely fluid and can change rapidly,\u201d the agency said.\u00a0 ##Health## CNN's town hall is now turning to the question of whether someone can become reinfected once they've had the novel coronavirus. Here's what Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said:  \"There is no design study that\u00a0has proven that you are 'protected' but, if this virus -- and I have every reason to\u00a0believe that it will -- acts like\u00a0any other virus that we have\u00a0had any experience with, once\u00a0you get infected, and recover\u00a0from that infection, your body\u00a0will mount a response that will\u00a0protect you from reexposure and\u00a0rechallenge with that exact\u00a0virus.\" The question: \"How confident are you that you\u00a0get some protection after\u00a0you've been infected?\"  The answer: \"I have been dealing\u00a0with viruses my entire\u00a0professional life, and the\u00a0viruses in which you get\u00a0infected and you get a complete\u00a0response where you clear the\u00a0virus, you can be protected.\u00a0The duration of the protection\u00a0varies -- it might be a lifetime.\u00a0If you get\u00a0infected with measles, it is\u00a0highly likely that you are\u00a0protected for life from\u00a0re-exposure to measles.\u00a0Highly likely.\u00a0Maybe a bit less depending on\u00a0how long you live.\u00a0Other viruses, we have less\u00a0experience with.\u00a0Projecting what we know about\u00a0viruses, I would say that there\u00a0is a very good chance that you're\u00a0protected.\" Watch: ##Town Hall## A FedEx employee in Memphis, Tennessee, has tested positive for Covid-19 and is recovering at home, the company said in a statement.\u00a0 The office -- on Shady Grove, a street in the city -- has been closed for a thorough cleaning and disinfecting, and all employees who work in that building will be permitted back in once that process is complete, the company said in a statement. How is Covid-19 affecting deliveries?  According to a statement from FedEx, the company is continuing to \"operate to and from impacted areas as local conditions and restrictions allow.\" \"The safety and well-being of our 475,000 team members is our top priority, as they continue to deliver critical goods to support communities across the globe. We appreciate our frontline team members and their unwavering commitment to deliver for our customers through this global crisis,\" the company said in a statement.\n\"Work and travel restrictions may affect shipments inbound and outbound to and from impacted areas, as well as shipments moving within those areas.\" ##Health## ##Business## An anti-malaria drug that was made available for coronavirus patients should not be viewed as a panacea, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at CNN's coronavirus town hall on Thursday. Here's what he said: \"Let me put it into perspective\u00a0for the viewers, and perhaps we\u00a0will understand it better.\u00a0There are two drugs, very similar,\u00a0they've been used for decades\u00a0for malaria, as well for the\u00a0treatment of autoimmune\u00a0diseases like lupus.\u00a0It is a very inexpensive drug,\u00a0it is tried and true, it has\u00a0been around for a long time,\" Fauci explained. \"There has been anecdotal, non-proven, anecdotal data, that\u00a0it works -- when people give it to someone, it makes them better. But when you have an uncontrolled trial, you can never definitely say it works.\"  \"Today, there are no proven safe\u00a0and effective therapies for the\u00a0coronavirus,\" Fauci said. \"That doesn't mean that we are\u00a0not going to do everything we\u00a0can to make things that even\u00a0have a hint of efficacy more\u00a0readily available, so long as you do it in the\u00a0context of some sort of\u00a0protocol that would take a look\u00a0at getting information about safety and efficacy. But\u00a0there is no magic drug out\u00a0there right now.\" ##Town Hall## CNN Corespondent David Culver is in Shanghai, China, bringing the latest developments there to the ongoing town hall. On Thursday, China reported no new domestically transmitted cases for the first time since the pandemic began.  Here's what Culver said: The reaction: \"People are hesitant to\u00a0breathe easy. They are still very reluctant\u00a0to think that this has passed\u00a0them, and perhaps, that is\u00a0something the World Health\u00a0Organization officials are\u00a0grateful for.\u00a0They say it avoids complacency.\" Second surge: \"They are portraying this as an\u00a0external threat more than anything\u00a0else.\u00a0They fear imported cases.\u00a0While the number of locally\u00a0transmitted cases has sat at\u00a0zero for the last 24 hours,\u00a0since the most recent reporting,\u00a0they say they've seen 34 new\u00a0imported cases coming from\u00a0other countries.\u00a0They are stepping up some of\u00a0the screening procedures,\u00a0and evaluations, of people who are\u00a0traveling from all over the\u00a0world, which is a complete\u00a0reversal of what we saw a few\u00a0weeks ago, when people were\u00a0fearing traveling from China,\u00a0now they are fearing folks coming from other countries.\" Watch: ##Town Hall## Panama is shutting down all international flights starting Sunday, the country's President Nito Cortizo wrote on Twitter. All incoming and outgoing international flights to and from the Central American country will be suspended, starting 11:59 p.m. Sunday, March 22.  Flights will be suspended for 30 days -- but cargo, humanitarian and domestic flights will be able to continue their operations normally until further notice, Cortizo said. Panama -- a country of almost 4 million people -- has 109 cases of coronavirus and one death, according statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Medicine. Peru's Ministry of Health announced the country's first death due to novel coronavirus, according to a statement published late Thursday. The victim was a 78-year-old man who also suffered from high blood pressure, the statement says. There are 234 cases in the South American country, according to President Martin Vizcarra. ##Health## A member of the medical administrative staff at an ICE detention center in the United States has tested positive for coronavirus. ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- and staffers at ICE are responsible for enforcing US immigration law. The staff member works at the detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, according to a notification sent to Congress by ICE and obtained by CNN.  The staffer, who was under self-quarantine, is receiving treatment. ICE says no detainees or other staff at the facility are currently symptomatic. ICE also says that currently none of their detainees have confirmed cases of coronavirus. New Jersey has more than 740 cases of coronavirus, including nine deaths. ##Health## Young people need take the coronavirus outbreak seriously in order to avoid infecting those who may be more vulnerable to the virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institue of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of President Donald Trump's key advisers on the pandemic, explained at CNN's town hall. Here's how he explained it: We\u00a0are getting more and more\u00a0information that someone can\u00a0transmit even when they are\u00a0asymptomatic.\u00a0So in order to protect oneself,\u00a0society and particularly the\u00a0vulnerable people, we've really got to\u00a0adhere to the physical\u00a0separation.\u00a0You know them well now: avoiding crowds, stay out of\u00a0bars, stay out of restaurants, stay\u00a0out of places where there is a\u00a0congregation of people.\u00a0And particularly, individuals who\u00a0are elderly, or individuals who\u00a0have an underlying condition,\u00a0should essentially self-isolate\u00a0themselves for the time being\u00a0in order to shield themselves\u00a0from what might be an innocent, unintended,\u00a0inadvertent transmission.\u00a0\nThat's a message I would really like to get\u00a0out, particularly to the\u00a0younger people who may not take\u00a0it seriously.\u00a0I mean, I just think back when I was young,\u00a0I kind of felt like I was invulnerable -- you know, well I'll do fine.\u00a0But it's not just you, it's you and society and the people\u00a0that are vulnerable.\u00a0So please cooperate, we are going through a very\u00a0difficult, unprecedented time\u00a0right now.\u00a0 ##Town Hall## New Orleans -- the biggest city in Louisiana -- is offering drive-through coronavirus testing at two locations. But not everyone will qualify -- only first responders and healthcare workers can get tested. Louisiana has more than 380 cases, including 10 deaths. New Orleans has the largest number of positive coronavirus cases in the the state.  When does it start? The testing sites will be open seven days a week, beginning Friday, March 20.  Who can get tested? For now, the sites will only test healthcare facility workers and first responders who are symptomatic. According to a news release: \"These individuals are working around the clock to provide care, compassion and safety to residents, and are at high risk for exposure and spread. As availability allows, testing criteria may be expanded beyond the initial pilot program.\" How will it work? Individuals will be required to remain in their vehicles and to provide identification, health insurance information and a healthcare facility employee or first responder badge. Staff in full medical protective gear will check the individual\u2019s temperature with a no-touch thermometer and use a nasal swab to take a sample. Test results will be given by phone within three to five days. Is this the first drive-through testing site? No, South Korea has already rolled out a similar system.

Four family members, a mother and three siblings, have all died after being diagnosed with coronavirus.  Vincent Fusco, Jr., a man in his 50s, died today, according to Roseann Paradiso Fodera, a cousin of one of the family members who died and an attorney representing the family. \u201cThis is an unbearable tragedy for the family,\u201d Paradiso Fodera said.\u00a0Her first cousin, Grace Fusco, was one of the four who passed away after being diagnosed as positive, she said. Two of Grace's children, Carmine Fusco and Rita Fusco-Jackson, siblings to Vincent Jr., also died prior to Grace's death, Paradiso Fodera said.  The New York Times was the first to report about the family. \u201cThe family\u2019s biggest concern is that we have four members of one family who have passed, two on life support and one stable.\u00a0All Covid-19 positive. Yet, 19 children, parents and grandchildren in this family tested on Saturday and they are anxious that their relatives have passed and they don\u2019t know if they are infected or not,\u201d Paradiso Fodera said. Paradiso Fodera said the 19 were tested on Saturday, but they have yet to learn the results.  All family members were hospitalized at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, New Jersey, except for Carmine, who was at a different facility in Pennsylvania when he died. Many family members who are not hospitalized are quarantined together. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the family members who are not hospitalized have the test results? This is a public health crisis. Why should athletes and celebrities without symptoms be given priority over a family that has been decimated by this virus? \u201cThere must be an investigation by the CDC or NIH as to why this family was so susceptible to the virus,\u201d Paradiso Fodera asked. CNN\u2019s Bonnie Druker contributed to this report. Boston Celtics player Marcus Smart confirmed he tested positive for coronavirus. Smart took to Twitter to announce the news, saying, \u201cI was tested 5 days ago and the results came back tonight, which were positive. Ive been self quarantined since the test, thank goodness. COVID-19 must be taken w the highest of seriousness. I know it\u2019s a #1 priority for our nations health experts, & we must get more testing ASAP.\u201d Smart also posted a video on the tweet.

Ron DeSantis said he issued an order Thursday morning to limit gatherings on beaches to no more than 10. \"So what you've see now is a lot of the sheriff's departments have instituted protocols \u2026 Cocoa Beach, major spring break destination went down 70% since my order. And so, I think that's a more prudent approach to do social distancing,\" the Republican governor said. The governor also wants Spring Break vacationers to know that the party is over. \u201cSince I issued my directive, anybody who's put that in place, spring break\u2019s done. Any place to go for bars and all this done. They don't have a place to go.\u201d DeSantis added that he spoke to the US surgeon general recently about social distancing. He doesn\u2019t want people living in the Sunshine State to stay inside all day if they feel fine. \u201cThey [medical experts] want you to social distance, of course, but they actually encourage people to get fresh air. They just don't want you congregating in big groups. And so, if you have a Floridian that, you know, goes walks their dogs like a married couple on the beach, as long as you're not within six feet of each other, they view that. And, you know, that's a healthy thing. And so, I think it's important to allow that if the local communities want to do it, to be to be able to do it,\" he said. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## States need more medical and testing supplies. That was the message from governors around the country to President Trump on Thursday, as they met with members of the coronavirus task force. The President, who at times appeared frustrated, spoke with governors from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s\u00a0headquarters in Washington, DC. Many of the governors, like Phil Murphy of New Jersey and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, said their main worry is that there is not enough personal protection equipment available in their states \u2014 like masks, disposable gowns, and other supplies.\u00a0 Trump told Murphy that the states should be working to get whatever equipment they need on their own, but the federal government would help if it could. \u201cTry what you can\u00a0\u2014\u00a0do the best you can to get what you can\u00a0actually get,\u201d Trump said. Addressing some of the concerns about access to necessary medical equipment, Vice President Mike Pence told governors to immediately \"take inventory of your medical supply needs.\" He said the federal government would work with any state \"in the middle of critical response\" to \"get you what you need.\" But he said other states should go through the normal routes to obtain medical equipment from the marketplace, even as hospital workers raise concerns about shortages. \"Other states, you need to talk to your healthcare leaders, providers and make sure that they are going to the supply chain and we encourage you to pull them together today to emphasize that point,\" Pence said. Days after the President insisted access to testing wasn\u2019t an issue, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker pressed the task force over the amount of available coronavirus tests that would be provided to his state. Pritzker said that Illinois did not have enough equipment to properly conduct tests. He said those were being \u201cmonopolized\u201d by the drive-through sites the federal government was operating. Members of the administration said that wasn\u2019t true. Other state leaders said that even when they did get test kits, there were problems with how they were being distributed. Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota told the group that she spent weeks requesting testing supplies, only to have them go to a lab in her state that wasn\u2019t approved to operate by the Food and Drug Administration.\u00a0 \u201cSo they received what I was trying to get for two weeks when they\u2019re not even approved, not even up and running,\u201d she told the President. She said she had even started asking other states for help. As she voiced her frustration and confusion over how it happened, the President cut her off.\u00a0\u201cAlright. We got it. Thanks Kris,\u201d he said, as the governor continued to speak. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who the President had snapped his fingers at as Noem spoke, jumped in to answer. He said the hospital \u201cprobably bought them on the open market.\" \u201cAfter this call we\u2019ll get on with you to make sure you\u2019re getting what you need,\u201d Azar said. The governor tried to make further requests, but her connection cut out before she could finish.\u00a0 The President offered little feedback to the governors, choosing instead to leave much of the substance of the meeting to Pence, Azar and other members of the task force.\u00a0 \u00a0##Health## The Philadelphia 76ers announced Thursday that three members of its organization have tested positive for COVID-19. \"Three\u00a0individuals have received positive test results for COVID-19. All other tests results are currently negative. We have reported this information to state and local health authorities as required,\" the team's statement said. \"Pursuant to CDC guidelines, the individuals are in self-isolation and will be monitored closely by medical professionals. The health of our players, staff, fans and community is paramount, and we continue to be guided by medical experts at this time.\" The organization did not identify the three members. ##Health## New\u00a0York\u00a0City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city\u00a0is two to three weeks away from running out of medical supplies. According to De Blasio, the\u00a0city\u00a0needs these items: 3 million N95 masks\n50 million surgical masks\n15,000 ventilators\n25 million each of personal protective equipment, surgical gowns, coveralls, gloves and face masks \u201cI said very clearly that for the month of March, we have the supplies that we need, the city has very strong reserves of the kind of supplies that I talked about.\u00a0... It is going into April that I\u2019m worried about. I don\u2019t have the perfect day for you, we\u2019re assessing all the time but it is a day, two weeks from now or three weeks from now where we must, by then, have had a very substantial resupply. So I think the simple way to think about it, is that the federal government has, essentially, two weeks to get us major resupply or the people of New York City are going to be in much greater danger.\u201d ##Health## California Gov. Gavin Newsom described in letter to President Trump on Thursday the impact coronavirus will have on the state and its residents. \u201cWe project that roughly 56% of our state\u2019s population \u2013 25.5 million people \u2013 will be infected with the virus over an eight-week period,\u201d he said. He asked that the US Navy\u2019s Mercy Hospital Ship be stationed at the port of Los Angeles. Defense officials tell CNN the ship will head to the Seattle area in the next five to 10 days.\u00a0The final destination could always change depending on civilian needs, an official cautioned. Newsom said the hospital ship \u201cwill help decompress the health care system to allow the Los Angeles region to ensure that it has the ability to address critical acute care needs.\u201d ##Health##\u00a0 Sean Payton, the head coach of the NFL's New Orleans Saints, has acknowledged that he is recovering from coronavirus.\u00a0 He thanked people on Twitter for \"the well wishes\" after ESPN posted an interview with the Super Bowl-winning coach where he disclosed the diagnosis. Payton told ESPN that he started to feel unwell this past Sunday and was tested Monday. He says he is self-isolating at home and feeling fatigued, but is not experiencing a fever or cough. \"This is not just about social distancing,\" Payton told ESPN. \"It's shutting down here for a week to two weeks. If people understand the curve, and understand the bump, we can easily work together as a country to reduce it. Take a minute to understand what the experts are saying. It's not complicated to do what they're asking of us. Just that type of small investment by every one of us will have a dramatic impact. Eligible inmates who have served at least 50% of their sentence and meet all other early release requirements will be released early, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office in Colorado. The law enforcement agency tweeted that they will begin the early releases Thursday and continue with daily releases \"until the risk of Covid-19 spread if mitigated.\" According to the tweet, none of the inmates or employees have tested positive for novel coronavirus. The Sheriff's Office went on to say they are initiating the process because reducing the jail population will reduce the risk\u00a0of exposure.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## Niger's president Issoufou Mahamadou announced the country's first case of coronavirus Thursday. In a tweet, he urged everyone to stay calm and respect all measures to help prevent the spread of the virus. ##Health## South Carolina Gov.

There are at least 81 cases of coronavirus in South Carolina, according to the state's epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell. ##Daily Life## Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell just introduced a\u00a0sweeping, $1 trillion emergency economic aid proposal in response to coronavirus pandemic. The proposal would include direct payments to Americans under a certain income threshold, $200 billion in loans to airlines and distressed industry sectors, and $300 in forgivable bridge loans for small businesses.\u00a0 The proposal, a draft of which was obtained by CNN, underscores the scale of the economic crisis now facing individuals and businesses across the country amid the accelerating pandemic and addresses bolstering health care resources, student loans and aid, business tax provisions and temporary authority.\u00a0 The proposal, however, is just an opening bid as the Senate attempts to address the coronavirus outbreak. It was drafted by Senate Republicans and the Trump administration, with no input from Democrats. At the heart of the proposal is hundreds of billions of dollars directed toward \u201crecovery rebates\u201d of up to $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples beneath a certain income threshold. The proposal also includes $300 billion to be used for loans to small businesses, however structured, as well as private nonprivate organizations. The program would be structured so businesses could\u00a0take out loans from banks and lenders that would be guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Those loans must be used, according to the proposal, for to pay salaries, mortgage payments, other debt obligations and payroll support including paid sick, medical and family leave, as well as health care benefits. ##Daily Life## A trade group representing the largest US airlines is asking Congress and the Trump administration to work together and quickly implement financial aid to protect millions of airline jobs. In a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Airlines for America said its speaking on behalf of 11 million workers the industry either directly represents or supports. \"The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the government- and business-imposed restrictions on air travel are having never-before seen impacts on U.S. aviation and our employees,\u201d the trade group said. \u201cThe breadth and immediacy of the need to act cannot be overstated. It is urgent and unprecedented.\u201d Airlines for America represents the biggest US airline carriers, including American Airlines, Delta, United and Southwest. ##Travel## Two active duty Army mobile hospital units have received \"prepare to deploy\u201d orders, according to Army Chief of Staff General James McConville. This type of order is an early signal to military units to be ready to deploy, although final orders could still change. The units would be sent to still-to-be determined areas where additional medical beds are needed to treat non-infectious patients, so civilian hospitals can focus on those with coronavirus.\u00a0 The units receiving the orders are the 47th\u00a0Combat Support Hospital based at Joint-Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state which has seen a significant virus outbreak, and the 586th\u00a0Field Hospital at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Both units typically deploy with hundreds of troops, including full surgical and trauma care capability. In recent years these types of units have made repeated deployments to warzones.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear yet, if these units deploy,\u00a0what types of manning levels and medical expertise they will utilize. The Pentagon has said as they deploy medical units it wants to ensure military bases still have sufficient medical care, and if reservists are called up that local communities are not impacted. ##Health## One of Brazilian President Jair\u00a0Bolsonaro\u2019s\u00a0son set off a war of words Thursday, after calling the Chinese government a \u201cdictatorship\u201d that purposely hid the severity of coronavirus.

Parts of Chinese social media, and even the country's government, appear to have launched a concerted campaign to question the origin of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 170,000 people globally as of Tuesday midday, according to CNN's case tracker. The first reported cases of the virus were in Wuhan, and scenes from the city on lockdown shocked the world. The lockdown gave an early indication for how seriously global authorities would need to combat the fast-spreading virus. \"Viruses know no borders and they don't care about your ethnicity or the color of your skin or how much money you have in the bank,\" said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program. \"It's really important that we be careful in the language we use.\" The Festival de Cannes has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the organizers tweeted Thursday The film festival's organizers added that \u201cseveral options are considered in order to preserve its running, the main one being simple postponement, in Cannes, until the end of June-beginning of July, 2020.\" The festival was originally planned for May 12-13. ##Business##\u00a0 The Pentagon has not received a request from the State Department at this point to operate flights that would be used to fly Americans currently stranded overseas back to the United States, two defense officials tell CNN.\u00a0 President Trump indicated on Thursday that such planning was already in place for a group of Americans in Peru who are unable to arrange flights home amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe're trying to get them out. And, you know, they got caught. They were late with their flights. We gave them a period of time. They didn't make it, but we're looking to get them out with military, probably through the military,\u201d Trump said during a news conference Thursday at the White House. ##Travel## Days after Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced that the Defense Department would use its labs to help conduct coronavirus testing for civilians, a top military medical official said that the military had not yet been asked to do that. \u201dThe department has made our 14 certified coronavirus testing labs available to test non-DOD personnel as well, and we will soon offer two additional labs for that purpose.\u00a0We hope this will provide excess capacity to the civilian population,\u201d Esper said Tuesday.  Esper repeated this at the White House press conference on Wednesday. But on Thursday,\u00a0Army Lt. Gen.

But on Capitol Hill, warp speed isn\u2019t that simple and could mean more than a week before relief comes. There are many legislative hurdles and ample policy differences that lawmakers still have to iron out.  That\u2019s left Republican and Democratic leaders uncertain how quickly a bill can pass Congress, meaning getting a final measure to President Trump\u2019s desk next week is currently the most optimistic assessment, at best. That means industries and workers now under siege from the damaging economic crisis will be forced to wait for the legislative sausage-making to work its course. And once the bill is eventually passed, it will take time to get implemented, including proposed payments to workers who have been displaced because of the unprecedented impact of the novel coronavirus. While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked congressional leaders for a bill to be completed by Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democratic lawmakers that is an unrealistic timeframe, according to a source familiar with her remarks.  Pelosi pointed to the last round of talks with the Trump administration that continued to drag on over the emergency relief package that was just signed into law, the source said. Republicans in the Senate seem to share a similar assessment. \u201cA lot of it depends on how quickly things can come together through the weekend,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, the Senate majority whip and a South Dakota Republican. \u201cBut then we are going to start the negotiations with the Democrats.

A sixth case was reported from a veteran's hospital on the island. \"If we can redirect all flights to enter through the international airport,\" for example, the island can \"centralize\" screenings, the governor said.  \"It's not a complete cut-off,\" Vazquez added. Puerto Rican officials are scheduled to speak to FAA officials on Friday, she said.  \"We'll see what the concerns are or if there are any alternatives they can offer to our request,\" says Vazquez. ##Travel## The coronavirus is impacting US military operations in places like Iraq and Afghanistan as measures to prevent its spread have led to major changes in both theaters. In Iraq, the US-led training effort aimed at combating ISIS has been suspended \u201cfor 60 days\u00a0as a precaution due to the global pandemic,\u201d\u00a0the United Kingdom Defense Ministry announced Thursday. The UK, one of the larger contributors to the coalition in Iraq, also said that it would be returning some of its personnel back to the UK due to the pause. Similarly, the US-led international coalition in Afghanistan has implemented a series of restrictions in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus, including \u201ctemporarily\u201d pausing the movement of personnel movement into Afghanistan and delaying the return of some service members.\u00a0 Such actions could complicate US plans to drawdown its forces level in Afghanistan to 8,600, a key aspect of the US-Taliban agreement that was signed late last month. \u201cIn some cases these measures will necessitate some service members remaining beyond their scheduled departure dates,\u201d Gen. Scott Miller, the commander of US and international forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement. Some more background: US Army Col. Sonny Leggett, a spokesperson for US Forces Afghanistan, said in a tweet Wednesday that while the command was instituting screening and testing protocols to reduce the risk to personnel, he added that \"we continue to execute the ordered drawdown to 8,600.\" American Airlines CEO has told employees that the airline has taken out a $1 billion loan \u201cto strengthen our balance sheet,\u201d according to an email sent to employees obtained by CNN. \"Doug remains in Washington, DC, along with other airline CEOs, making the case for an aid package.\u00a0Team member needs and our future are at the forefront of his motivation as he does this work, and more information will be coming soon,\" the aid request stated while referring to CEO Doug Parker.

Currently not approved for use in the United States, Bayer is working with appropriate agencies on an Emergency Use Authorization for the drug's use in the U.S,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBayer thanks the Trump administration for moving quickly to enable this donation and will continue to work closely with the administration to support its efforts in the fight against COVID-19.\u201d Earlier Thursday: President Trump said the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine would be available with a prescription to treat the novel coronavirus.  Early evidence from human cells suggests that chloroquine \u2014 which is used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases \u2014 may have some activity against the novel coronavirus.\u00a0 Doctors in China, the US and other countries have used the drug experimentally in COVID-19 patients, but there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it's effective in humans.\u00a0 ##Health## Another 29 people in England have died of coronavirus, bringing the total deaths in the UK to 137, the National Health Service England said in a statement Thursday.

They tested positive. Hopefully they\u2019ll all going to get better. It\u2019s one of those things, it\u2019s Congress,\u201d Trump said.

So in addition to the big medical ships that you have coming, if we need ships with lots of rooms, they\u2019ll be docked at New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco, different places,\u201d he said. ##Health## Vice President Mike Pence, the head of the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus task force, said that \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of tests are being conducted across the country daily, and testing centers are now required by law to report those test numbers. \u201cBecause of the public private partnership that the President initiated several weeks ago, tens and thousands of tests are being performed every day,\u201d Pence said at a Thursday press briefing at the White House. In addition, he said, \u201cstate and private labs are now required by law to report all coronavirus testing directly to the CDC, which will give the American public and our research timely and important information.\u201d More context: The administration has come under increasing criticism in recent days for being unable to say how many people in the United States have been tested.\u00a0\u00a0 Still, Pence encouraged only those with symptoms to get tested, despite the possibility of asymptomatic spread. \u201cIt is important for every American to remember, if you don't have symptoms, you don't need the test,\u201d he said. ##Health## \u00a0 President Trump said the antimalarial drug chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine would soon be made available with a prescription to treat the novel coronavirus. Early evidence from human cells suggests that chloroquine \u2014 which is used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases \u2014 may have some activity against the novel coronavirus.\u00a0 Doctors in China, the US and other countries have used the drug experimentally in COVID-19 patients, but there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it's effective in humans. The drug, generally considered to be safe for most patients, can have side effects including seizures, nausea, vomiting, deafness, vision changes and low blood pressure. Some more context: When asked about chloroquine last month, Dr. Janet Diaz of the World Health Organization said \"there is no proof that that is an effective treatment at this time. We\u00a0recommend that therapeutics be tested under ethically approved\u00a0clinical trials to show\u00a0efficacy and safety.\"\u00a0 At the time, Diaz said the drugs that were being prioritized by WHO's research and development efforts were antivirals. Trump also mentioned an antiviral drug, remdesivir, which is the focus of clinical trials in China and the US.  Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral that appears to work against a range of very different virus families, including coronaviruses and Ebola. The drug is already being tested at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in adults diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. ##Health## There are at least\u00a010,502\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to the state and local health agencies, governments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In an\u00a0address to the nation\u00a0Thursday, Modi asked that all citizens stand on their balconies at 5 p.m. local on Sunday and clap or ring bells for five minutes as a show of appreciation for medical staff, police,\u00a0government\u00a0workers and\u00a0others involved in working to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The prime minister also asked the nation to \"not get complacent\" and encouraged people to not leave their homes\u00a0unless it is an emergency.\u00a0 Modi also announced the formation of an economic\u00a0task force headed by the finance minister to try and mitigate the\u00a0economic situation surrounding coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cThey will decide the steps needed to be taken to combat the economic crisis caused by this pandemic,\u201d Modi said.\u00a0 Modi added that people should not be hoarding supplies.\u00a0 \"We are taking all steps to ensure that there is no shortage of food, essential supplies and drugs,\" Modi said, adding, \"panic buying is not right.\" ##Daily Life## Dr.\u00a0Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, praised the practice of self-isolation and the increase in testing in helping to tackle this pandemic. \"The number of test\u00a0positives is increasing.\u00a0That's a dramatically important signature\u00a0that everybody is doing their\u00a0job.\u00a0Those with mild symptoms are\u00a0staying home, self-isolating.\u00a0Those with serious symptoms are coming forward to getting testing. Our test positive rates are in\u00a0the 10 to 11% range,\" Birx said. More on this: Birx said during Wednesday\u2019s briefing at the White House that the coronavirus task force is concerned about reports indicating that more young people are becoming seriously ill from coronavirus, suggesting they may have continued to be exposed to the virus because they weren\u2019t concerned about being at risk. \u201cThere are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs,\u201d Birx said.

Hahn added that it's the FDA's \"responsibility to the\u00a0American people is to ensure\u00a0that products are safe and\u00a0effective\" when discussing the drugs and therapeutic options being explored to address the coronavirus.  ##Health## President Trump says he\u2019s pushed the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate barriers to getting therapeutics for coronavirus to patients. He said a drug currently used as an antimalarial \u2014 hydroxychloroquine \u2014 would be made available almost immediately to treat coronavirus. \"It\u2019s been around for a long time, so we know if things don\u2019t go as planned, it\u2019s not going to kill anybody,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House today. Trump said it was a common drug and would soon be available for \u201cprescribed use\u201d on coronavirus.

Yamaguchi, who won a Judo bronze medal at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, said she plans to raise this point at a JOC Board Meeting scheduled for March 27. \"The Olympics should not be held in a situation people in the world can\u2019t enjoy,\" Yamaguchi said. \"As far as I can tell, athletes in the United States and Europe are unable to train as normal and finish their qualifying matches. That makes it impossible for them to appear well prepared at the start, with all the associated risks,\" Yamaguchi said. Some context: Yamaguchi\u2019s comments come after International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Hayley Wickenheiser on Tuesday called the decision to proceed with the Games \u201cinsensitive and irresponsible.\u201d Wickenheiser, who competed for Canada in five Winter Olympic Games in Ice Hockey and at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Softball, wrote in a statement on Twitter: \"This crisis is bigger than even the Olympics [\u2026] Athletes can't train.

Andrew Cuomo attempted to assuage concerns this morning by saying \"there is no quarantine plan for\u00a0New York City\" as it relates to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo went on to discuss New Rochelle, which is in Westchester County. As of Wednesday morning, 538 of the more than 2,380 cases in New York state were in Westchester County. \"My containment plan in new\u00a0Rochelle didn't contain anyone.\u00a0It was a bad word.\u00a0It meant to contain the virus.\u00a0You could come and go in new\u00a0Rochelle, schools were closed,\u00a0large gatherings were closed.\u00a0But there was no quarantine\u00a0containment.\u00a0Well, you called out the\u00a0National Guard.\u00a0I called out the National Guard\u00a0to help with food delivery and\u00a0cleaning surfaces,\" Cuomo said. Some context: On Tuesday, Cuomo dismissed the possibility of an imminent\u00a0shelter-in-place order after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to prepare for the measure. De Blasio told New Yorkers to prepare for the possibility within the next two days. \"I think New Yorkers should be prepared right now for the possibility of a shelter in place order,\" de Blasio, a Democrat, said during a press briefing about\u00a0coronavirus. \"It has not happened yet but it is definitely a possibility at this point. I believe that decision should be made in the next 48 hours, and it's a very, a very difficult decision.\" However, a shelter-in-place order would have to be approved by Gov. Cuomo. Watch: ##Daily Life## The New York Federal Reserve continues to point a firehose of liquidity at clogged-up financial markets. The NY Fed just announced\u00a0it will purchase another $10 billion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on Thursday via two separate operations. The cash injections, according to the NY Fed, are aimed at tackling \"highly unusual disruptions\" in the mortgage bond market linked to the coronavirus outbreak. The $10 billion is part of the $200 billion in mortgage bonds the Fed\u00a0promised on Sunday to buy as it relaunched quantitative easing, or QE. And this is on top of the flurry of overnight repo operations that are aimed at unclogging short-term funding markets. And the NY Fed made clear its MBS may only be beginning. The statement said the NY Fed \"stands ready\" to buy even more mortgage bonds if it's needed to keep markets operating smoothly. ##Business## To alleviate some of the financial hardships New Yorkers are experiencing due to the spread of coronavirus, Gov.

Germany's Defense Ministry will mobilize its armed forces and call up army reserves to support the government's efforts to cope with the coronavirus crisis, Defense Minister\u00a0Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\u00a0said Thursday in Berlin.\u00a0 ''We are preparing for a worst-case scenario where a very large number of people will become infected and we have the human resources to help,\"\u00a0Kramp-Karrenbauer\u00a0said during a press briefing, adding that the\u00a0capabilities of the army reserves should be used\u00a0sensibly. \"This will be important, especially if the crisis lasts longer,\" she added.\u00a0 In her statement to the press, the German defense minister assured\u00a0citizens that they will be able to rely upon the armed forces over the course of the COVID-19 crisis. \"The fight against\u00a0the virus is a\u00a0marathon,\"\u00a0Kramp-Karrenbauer\u00a0said.\u00a0 ##Health## The Energy Department promised Thursday to support US oil producers facing \"potentially catastrophic losses\" by quickly purchasing 30 million barrels of crude. Those barrels,\u00a0purchased at dirt-cheap prices, will be used to start filling up America's emergency oil stockpile, known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR. The initial purchase will be focused on small and midsize US oil producers, the\u00a0group most at risk\u00a0from the oil crash to $20 a barrel. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he will recommend to President Trump that he request funding from Congress to buy even more crude \u2014\u00a0enough to fill up the SPR. \"At $22 for WTI crude, we should be filling up the reserve for the next 10 years,\"\u00a0Mnuchin said on Fox Business Thursday morning. Mnuchin said the oil market has \"nothing to do with the coronavirus, other than there's just a lot less demand.\" That's not exactly right: The demand destruction, caused by mass cancellations of flights and widespread factory shutdowns, is a major driver of the oil crash. The other huge problem: Saudi Arabia and Russia are flooding the market with too much supply in a bid to crowd out high-cost US producers. ##Business## The United Kingdom's communications team went into overdrive on Thursday in an attempt to play down fears of a lockdown in London.\u00a0 Reports of the imminent imposition of tighter restrictions in the capital gained steam after Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at a press conference on Wednesday night, repeatedly refused to deny that such measures were being considered.\u00a0 \u201cWe will rule nothing out and we will certainly wish to consider bringing forward further and faster measures where that is necessary,\u201d Johnson said. Multiple government sources told CNN on Wednesday that serious conversations about restricting travel in and out of the capital and limiting the city's transport network were taking place at the highest levels of government.\u00a0 However, on Thursday morning, the prime minister's official spokesperson told journalists that there was \"zero prospect\" of travel restrictions and that the government has \"no plans\" to shut down the London's transport network.\u00a0 Some context: It's worth remembering that until recently, the closure of schools was not something the government was considering, and that as recently as two weeks ago, the scientific evidence didn't support stopping mass gatherings such as concerts or music events.\u00a0 However, British schools will close their gates at the end of this week and as of Monday, mass gatherings will not be supported by emergency workers.\u00a0 Music festivals have been canceled, West End theaters shuttered and cultural life in the UK is winding down.

A state of local emergency was declared for Gulf Shores on Thursday. ##Daily Life## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has loosened its guidelines to allow health care workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 to continue working as long as they wear a mask, according to CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"This is a huge concern, John, because this is how you potentially increase the spread, at least not slow down the spread,\" Gupta said to CNN's John Berman this morning.  Within the guidelines, the CDC says bandanas and scarves could be used in place of a mask, Gupta said. The reason for these guidelines is due to a lack of personal protective equipment and not enough health care workers, Gupta said. Watch Gupta's remarks below: Iranian Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a tweet today that every 10 minutes, one\u00a0Iranian is killed by the coronavirus. Every hour, at least 50\u00a0Iranian are infected. Iran\u2019s Health Ministry confirmed 149 new deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours, raising the overall death toll to 1,284 on Thursday. This is the country's highest spike in death toll over a 24-hour period since the coronavirus outbreak began.\u00a0 There were additional 1,046 confirmed cases of coronavirus bringing the total to 18,407,\u00a0Iran\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi\u00a0said. \u00a0##Health## The Chinese government on Thursday announced the result of its investigation into issues related to Dr. Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who was reprimanded by police in Wuhan for trying to warn others about the coronavirus \u2014 and whose death from the virus on Feb. 7 sparked nationwide outrage. The national authorities confirmed that the 34-year-old Li, who worked at a hospital in Wuhan, re-posted internal government documents on the emerging outbreak on Dec. 30 in a social media group chat and warned others not to go outside.  Local police in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, subsequently summoned Li on Jan. 3 and issued him a formal reprimand. The government investigators also said that Li received proper treatment once he became ill, and all medical procedures were approved by him or his family. The authorities concluded that local police's reprimand of Li was \u201cinappropriate\u201d based on improper application of law and that it should be rectified. The government investigators urged local police to withdraw its reprimand and hold relevant personnel accountable. The US-led international coalition in Afghanistan has implemented a series of restrictions in order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, including \u201ctemporarily\u201d pausing the movement of personnel movement into Afghanistan and delaying the return of some service members. \u201cIn some cases these measures will necessitate some service members remaining beyond their scheduled departure dates,\u201d Gen. Scott Miller, the commander of US and international forces in Afghanistan said in a statement. \u201cAs of March 19, 21 Resolute Support personnel exhibiting flu-like symptoms are in isolation and receiving medical care,\u201d the statement said, referring to the official name of the international coalition operation. The statement said that because there are no testing facilities in Afghanistan, tests are being performed at a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, or at other civilian locations. Additionally \u201c1,500 multi-national service members, civilians and contractors who have arrived in theater within the past week are living in screening facilities prior to onward movement.\u201d Miller said that this was due to an \u201cAbundance of caution, not because they are sick.\u201d He also said that access to bases had been restricted and that while efforts to train and advise local Afghan forces continue there has been a push to conduct meetings via \u201ctechnical means\u201d as opposed to in person. \u00a0 The British government currently has no plans to restrict travel in and out of London or to close down the capital\u2019s underground tube service, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman told reporters Thursday. Transport for London (TFL) said Wednesday that it had plans to close \u201cuntil further notice\u201d up to 40 tube stations that do not interchange with other lines. Johnson is meeting Thursday with London mayor Sadiq Khan to discuss plans for the capital, according to City Hall.

But the problem is the vulnerable population,\" said D\u00edaz Asuyo in an interview on Spanish radio. She called the disease \"lethal\" for elderly people with pre-existing conditions, and said that in 24 or 48 hours \"it can end the life of a person who is in the vulnerable population group.\" As a result of this, the region of Madrid has sought to \"save time,\" unify healthcare in the public and private sectors, and convert \"normal beds into ICU beds.\" Some 580 beds in these critical units are occupied, D\u00edaz Asuyo said, and the Ministry of Health plans to facilitate \"new rapid tests\" to detect coronavirus this weekend. \u00a0##Health## The UK government has attempted to play down the prospect of an imminent lockdown in London, a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined to rule out stricter measures for the city. On Wednesday, multiple government sources told CNN that conservations had taken place in Downing Street discussing measures ranging from shutting down parts of the capital\u2019s transport network to restricting travel in and out of the city. Similar reports appeared across the UK media.\u00a0 On Thursday, the Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman said there was \u201czero prospect\u201d of any restrictions on travel in and out of London, and that there were \u201cno plans\u201d to shut down its transport network. However, the city\u2019s transport authority had already closed parts of London\u2019s Tube network, and the government did not rule out introducing further social distancing measures in the coming days. Johnson was due to meet the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on Thursday to discuss plans to fight coronavirus in London, a spokesman for City Hall told CNN. Giving evidence to the London assembly on Thursday, Khan said too many Londoners were failing to follow official advice. \u201cWe are clearly still in the early phase of this crisis but the spread of the virus is at a more advanced stage in London than in other parts of the country. This means that further measures will need to be introduced at the point at which they will have the biggest effect,\u201d he said. Chinese authorities have announced that some Beijing-bound international flights will be diverted to nearby cities for health screenings in the coming days.  Passengers will clear immigration and customs at their first point of entry and only those deemed healthy will be allowed to board the same aircraft again to fly to Beijing. Some context: The Chinese capital has recorded a growing number of imported coronavirus cases in recent days.  Beijing authorities have already tightened screening and quarantine procedures targeting international arrivals. With a few exceptions, all travelers arriving from abroad are now required to undergo a 14-day quarantine at designated government facilities at their own expense. ##Travel## Deaths from COVID-19 in Spain have jumped over 20% in the last day, reaching 767, according to a Spanish Health Ministry official speaking at a daily briefing in Madrid Thursday.

Hours after a meeting with industry representatives in which he spoke about \u201cscaling up\u201d supplies, Trump said on Twitter that he had only signed the act \u201cshould we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.\u201d\u00a0 \"It was so disassociated from what he said this morning at the press conference and what he said to us,\u201d said Dr. David Benton, CEO of the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, who was at the White House meeting. Benton said representatives \u201cdescribed to the President how critical [ventilators] are\" and expressed \u201canxiety\u201d about the availability of protective equipment including masks and gowns. The White House said more equipment was coming, just not under the Defense Production Act.\u00a0A senior administration official said that the Department of Health and Human Services was working with states and the private sector to facilitate distribution as needed. \u201cThe private sector has stepped up to make sure that we do everything possible to provide supplies to our healthcare workers and first responders, but if more cooperation is needed to address shortages, this order will ensure that the health and medical resources needed are properly distributed,\u201d the official said.  By the numbers: The Department of Homeland Security estimates that should the virus become \"very severe,\"\u00a038 million people will need medical care and 9.6 million will need hospitalization.\u00a0 Of those, an estimated 2.9 million people will need to be admitted to intensive care units, overwhelming current capacity.\u00a0 ##Health## German airline Lufthansa has announced drastic cutbacks in its flight operations, grounding 700 of its 763 planes.

I cannot believe those words have just come out of my mouth,\"\u00a0USHG Chief Executive Danny Meyer said in an emotional video message to staff. The company operates restaurants and event businesses in New York, Las Vegas, Washington DC and other cities. Meyer opened Union Square Cafe in 1985. \"The reality is that we've had to make drastic and previously unimaginable choices for how we conduct business just to protect our team and our communities ... in doing so, our revenues have been decimated, and the foundation of our business has been seriously tested,\" he said in a statement. Meyer will forgo his salary and members of the executive team will take pay cuts, which will go into an employee relief fund with other donations.\u00a0 \"The goal is to rehire as many of those people as soon as possible, when health and business conditions permit,\" USHG said in the announcement.

It involves a range of negative feelings and distress related to restricted movement: irritability, boredom, some hopelessness, restlessness\u00a0and difficulty concentrating.\u00a0 Your personality is a major factor in how quickly you develop these kinds of emotions.\u00a0If you're more extroverted and not used to being at home, you're probably more prone to feeling this way and may feel it instantly.

European Commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted Wednesday evening that he had spoken with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. Breton called on viewers and companies to \"#SwitchtoStandard definition when HD is not necessary\" to secure internet access for all. A Netflix spokesperson told CNN Business that Hastings and Breton will speak again on Thursday, and said it already adjusts streaming quality and tries to minimize bandwidth consumption.\u00a0 \"Commissioner Breton is right to highlight the importance of ensuring that the internet continues to run smoothly during this critical time,\" the Netflix spokesperson said. \"We've been focused on network efficiency for many years, including providing our open connect service for free to telecommunications companies.\" Facebook on Wednesday acknowledged that the effects of the pandemic were stretching it to the limit.\u00a0In a call with reporters, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was facing \"big surges\" in use as the coronavirus forces millions to stay home.\u00a0 He described the increase in demand as \"well beyond\" the annual spike usually seen on New Year's Eve. Voice and video calls on WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, in particular, are more than double usual levels.\u00a0 ##Business## It's a stunning reversal\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0would like Americans to forget. Only\u00a0days after dismissing the coronavirus threat as a distraction, he's now\u00a0assumed the title of a resolute war time president\u00a0fighting an \"invisible enemy\" while promising to rally the nation behind him in pursuit of \"total victory.\" Trump's new posture is in response to a crisis that is worsening by the hour and appears to be partly designed to cover up the administration's failures in distributing testing kits that might have helped authorities slow the virus' advance. But his somber rhetoric is already being undermined by his own actions. He's casting doubt over whether he will actually implement a\u00a0move to invoke the Defense Production Act, which could speed the production of badly needed ventilators, masks and other supplies for hospital workers. And it turns out the announcement that hospital ships will be deployed to New York and a forthcoming West Coast destination will happen more slowly than initially thought -- it could take weeks before the vessels are ready, said Defense Secretary Mark Esper. A war against coronavirus: Trump's war metaphor also suggests a willingness of the populace to allow some infringements of hard won civil liberties in extreme circumstances -- as is happening with self-isolating right now. But the concept of a wartime presidency also brings political and personal expectations of the commander-in-chief himself and may require a significant refashioning of Trump's divisive political method.

At a news conference on Thursday morning, officials from China's National Health Commission announced there had been just 34 new cases in the past 24 hours -- all imported from overseas -- and eight new deaths, all in Hubei, the province where the virus was first identified.  There were there no new reported cases in Hubei at all on Wednesday. Why this matters: The milestone will likely be held up as proof of the ongoing success of China's sweeping, top-down efforts to control the virus, despite\u00a0persistent allegations\u00a0that local\u00a0officials mishandled the initial outbreak. Just last month, mainland China was reporting thousands of new cases every day, and was considered the most high-risk infection area in the world. In the weeks following the early spread of the virus, the government enacted\u00a0draconian quarantine measures\u00a0and strict travel restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of citizens. In some hard-hit cities, residents have been\u00a0unable to leave their apartments\u00a0for more than a month, while transport between major population hubs has been limited or halted altogether. The unprecedented nature of the measures has exacted a steep toll, both on the many millions of ordinary Chinese forced to endure life under lockdown and the country's economy, which has seen a steep decline in recent weeks. But it has also apparently worked, with zero new local transmissions. And as the danger has lessened in China, the global infection rate continues to accelerate, with countries across multiple continents now grappling with fast-expanding outbreaks of their own.

More than 20 flights a day arrive in Mumbai from Gulf nations like the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. Yesterday, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs passed an order that all passengers coming from or transiting through those countries will be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival, either at government facilities or at home. Most of the travelers are Indian blue-collar workers on labor contracts in the Gulf countries, who are now returning home. Arrivals who are asymptomatic and have homes in Mumbai can go home and self-isolate for 14 days. If they live in neighboring towns, they can still stay at home but are not allowed to take public transport.  If they show symptoms, or live far from Mumbai, they will be quarantined in government facilities, said municipal government officials. Quarantine centers: One quarantine site is the Seven Hills Hospital in the Marol area of Mumbai -- but the city has also set up other quarantine facilities and a portal in partnership with hotels and marriage halls. The government quarantine facilities have about 700 beds available, said P Velrasu, Additional Municipal Commissioner.

Travelers coming from EU countries may only land at a German airport if they are traveling from their original destination to their home country. Germany had imposed the land border closures with those six countries earlier this week. Earlier today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned the public: She asked all citizens to play their part in containing the pandemic. \u201cThings are serious. Take this seriously. Since German unification, no, since the Second World War, there has not been a situation that was so dependent on us acting together in solidarity,\u201d she said. ##Travel## South Korea confirmed 152 new coronavirus cases yesterday -- a rise after a week of diminishing infection rates, and a reminder that the country is not yet out of the woods. For the past few days, South Korea had been reporting fewer than 100 cases per day, raising hopes that the outbreak's peak had passed. But new clusters have been identified; of the 152 new cases, 97 are from the city of Daegu, including 75 from one nursing facility, said Yoon Tae-ho of the Central Disaster Relief Headquarters today. The government is \"substantially cautious of the danger in the sense that sporadically cases are breaking out in nursing facilities and hospitals in clusters,\" Yoon said.\u00a0\u201cOur biggest concern is that those in the nursing facility or hospital are suffering from an existing condition and had been in the facility for a long time. They are very old.\" About 80% of all the confirmed cases in\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0are associated with\u00a0cluster transmissions, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday. South Korea now has 8,565 coronavirus patients, of which 91 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources.\u00a0 ##Health## In South Africa, spreading false information about the coronavirus is now a crime, punishable by up to six months in prison, a fine, or both. The move is one of several new measures announced by the government late Wednesday, in an effort to halt the spread of the virus and curb misleading rumors on social media. Other measures include legally enforcing testing, treatment and quarantine or isolation of suspected cases.  Earlier this week, a family in Gauteng province refused to be isolated after testing positive and had to be brought in by police after a court order.\u00a0 Visits to prisons have been suspended, and gatherings of more than 100 people are now prohibited by law. Gatherings of more than 50 people will also be banned if alcohol is present. South Africa has 116 cases of the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University -- most of them imported from overseas. ##Daily Life##\u00a0 New York City is nearly unrecognizable as the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic has driven crowds from the streets. Ridership on the city's subway system was down 3.7 million on Tuesday, compared with the same day last year. Times Square, normally teeming with vehicle and foot traffic, was lit up as ever but nearly uninhabited Monday as\u00a0bars and restaurants\u00a0became take-out only and public spaces like theaters and gyms shuttered. Rockefeller Center, like\u00a0other entertainment spots, was captured in an unfamiliar light Wednesday as it was closed, with no skaters and no onlookers to fill it. The city's hotels were less than 49% full last week, according to data released Wednesday, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a mandatory ban on businesses that would allow no more than 50% of the workforce to report for work outside their home. As a result, coming and going in the city has dwindled. Nearly 10 million Californian residents are under \"shelter in place\" orders -- meaning they are required to stay home, except for essential needs like buying groceries or picking up medication. This week, Mayor Bill de Blasio told New Yorkers to prepare for the possibility of a similar order, though the\u00a0final decision rests with Cuomo. ##Daily Life## \u00a0 The United Arab Emirates is extending its travel ban to deny entry to residency visa holders, according to state news agency WAM. The new restrictions go into effect today.\u00a0 Earlier this week, the UAE also suspended issuing all tourist visas and most work permits. UAE nationals in the country are also temporarily banned from traveling abroad.\u00a0 The UAE has 114 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources.\u00a0 ##Travel## On Thursday, Fiji's Prime Minister confirmed the country has its first coronavirus case.  That came as Samoa -- another Pacific island nation -- announced it had a suspected case. According to the Ministry of Health\u2019s news release, it could be days before the case can be confirmed.\u00a0 Other island nations have also reported cases, including French Polynesia, and the US territory Guam.\u00a0 This is bad news for Pacific Island nations, which are some of the most remote and aid-dependent in the world.\u00a0 Last year\u2019s measles outbreak in Samoa shows how easily disease can spread among its population of 200,000 -- and suggests the country would be ill-equipped to cope with the coronavirus.  During the measles outbreak, Samoa declared a state of emergency. Government offices and schools closed, and children were banned from public gatherings.\u00a0But it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent more than 80 deaths -- a devastating number for such a small population.\u00a0 Pacific Islands have taken strict measures. Samoa now requires all arrivals -- including residents -- to undergo a medical examination within three days before arrival.\u00a0 The way New Zealand has responded also shows how concerned it is for its much smaller neighbors. On Saturday, New Zealand announced that almost everyone entering the country needs to self-isolate for two weeks. At the time, the country\u2019s leader Jacinda Ardern described the measure as the strictest in the world.\u00a0 Of course, the rule was aimed at limiting the spread in New Zealand. But it was also put in place to look out for Pacific Islands.\u00a0 Although people coming from the Pacific would be allowed to avoid the self-isolation rule, anyone traveling to the Pacific would need to meet strict new exit rules, including a health assessment. Anyone who had traveled outside New Zealand in the past 14 days wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go to the Pacific. On Thursday, Ardern announced new measures, closing off the country's border to almost all non-New Zealanders -- including those coming from the Pacific. But again, protection of the Pacific was part of the plan. \u201cIt remains the case that the protection of the Pacific from Covid-19 is a major concern for the New Zealand government and these measures support that,\" Ardern said.\u00a0\n\u201cA small number of exemptions to the new measures can be sought for humanitarian reasons, essential health workers and citizens of Samoa and Tonga who need to travel to New Zealand for essential reasons.\u00a0\u00a0 New Zealand is a gateway to the Pacific. It\u2019s one of the few countries with flights to the Pacific Islands. It also has a large Pacific Island community, some of whom regularly travel to the islands. As one of the biggest aid donors to the Pacific, New Zealand would likely need to step in and help in the event of a coronavirus crisis -- just as it did during the measles outbreak. ##Travel## ##Health## A pivotal moment in China: Mainland China reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the first time since the the pandemic began. The country recorded 34 new cases of coronavirus yesterday -- all imported from overseas. Wuhan restrictions: The Chinese city at ground zero of the pandemic will need to see 14 consecutive days of no new cases before travel restrictions can be lifted, a top Chinese health expert said.  Hubei lockdown eases: Months of lockdowns and travel restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of citizens are slowly easing. Inter-provincial travel, which had previously been shut down entirely, is gradually resuming. People from other provinces are now allowed into Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. South Korea measures: The country with the biggest outbreak outside of China in Asia reported seven more deaths on Wednesday, bringing the total there to 91. South Korea has at least 8,565 cases of coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and additional sources. The government is supplying 50 trillion won ($38.8 billion) in emergency funding to support small business. South and Southeast Asia: Countries in South and Southeast Asia must \u201curgently scale-up aggressive measures\u201d and widespread testing to prevent the coronavirus from spreading further, said WHO officials. Bangladesh reported its first coronavirus death on Wednesday -- it has 14 cases in total. Thailand is now demanding health certificates from all travelers. The Philippines has been placed under a state of calamity for six months and at least half of the country is on lockdown, while Malaysia is under a nationwide movement restriction order. Second surge: Places like mainland China and Hong Kong are bracing for a potential second wave of infections, as people return from overseas, bringing the virus with them. Asia markets fall: Asian stocks and US futures sank Thursday despite a slew of steps unveiled to cushion the economic blow caused by the coronavirus. The Korean Exchange briefly suspended trading in Seoul after markets there plummeted. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was last down 4%, Hong Kong's\u00a0Hang Seng Index\u00a0fell 4.5%, while China's\u00a0Shanghai Composite\u00a0was last down 2.3%.\u00a0 ##Travel## ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Health## Bollywood star Deepika Padukone is the latest celebrity to join the \"Safe Hands Challenge.\" World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\u00a0kicked off the challenge on Tuesday, tweeting a video of himself washing his hands thoroughly and explaining the proper ways to do it. He then challenged a host of celebrities -- Padukone being one. She posted a hand-washing video in response, and tweeted, \"Covid-19 surely is an uphill health and public safety task, but all of us are in this fight together!\" She then called on star athletes Roger Federer, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Virat Kohli to post their own hand-washing videos. Other celebrities who have joined the challenge include \"Pose\" star and fashion icon Billy Porter, rapper G Herbo, and F1 driver Romain Grosjean. Take a look: ##Health## South Korea today announced an emergency economic aid package of $38.8 billion (50 trillion Korean won) for small businesses slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201c(We) will prepare a national financial crisis response program worth a total of 50 trillion won for the financial stability of people\u2019s livelihoods,\" said the country's finance minister Hong Nam-ki. \u201cThe financial stabilization package program for the people\u2019s livelihood will be first, strengthening financial support for small businesses, small business owners and self-employed people; second, easing financial burdens on vulnerable social groups; and finally third, will be a stabilizer of the financial market, such as stocks and bonds.\u201d At an emergency economic meeting today, President Moon Jae-in said the emergency package was \"an unprecedented, comprehensive measure in scale and content.\u201d\u00a0 The package will provide emergency management funds and loan guarantees for small business owners, which will \"allow (these owners) to get loans quickly and easily at low interest rates,\" Moon said. \u201cAll financial sectors will postpone loan interest payments of small businesses and small business owners.\u201d ##Business## Dozens of stations on the London Underground will be closed starting Thursday, as part of the effort to slow the coronavirus pandemic, Transport for London announced in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cUp to 40 London Underground stations that do not interchange with other lines will be closed until further notice. Anyone who needs to make essential journeys should check www.tfl.gov.uk for live travel updates before they travel,\u201d the statement read. The closures come after the government's advice this week to stop non-essential social contact and unnecessary travel. \"The Mayor of London and Transport for London are urging all other customers to follow the Government's advice and not make anything but essential journeys,\u201d said the statement. Public transport falls globally: It's not just in London -- New York City's MTA subway has seen a sharp fall in travelers this week as people stay home and self-quarantine. On Tuesday, 1.79 million people rode the subway. The same date last year, that number was close to 5.57 million, said the MTA in a tweet on Wednesday. \u201c3.7 million of you chose not to ride with us yesterday because you want to\u00a0#flattenthecurve. \u201cWe miss you, but for now, we\u2019ll say: thank you for not riding with us. You\u2019re keeping NYC safer,\" the MTA said. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## Seven members of a New Jersey family contracted the coronavirus, and three of them have now died, according to the New York Times. Grace Fusco, 73, died Wednesday without knowing that two of her eldest children also died before her, the Times reported. CNN was directed to a representative of the family for comment but have not heard back. A relative confirmed four other children who have the coronavirus remain hospitalized, with three in critical condition, according to the report. Fusco\u2019s eldest daughter, Rita Fusco-Jackson of Freehold, New Jersey, died Friday. Sometime after that, the family learned Fusco had the coronavirus. Fusco\u2019s eldest son, Carmine Fusco of Bath, Pennsylvania, died before his mother on Wednesday.\u00a0 A Tuesday night family dinner more than a week ago appears to the be the source of this coronavirus cluster, the Times reported. The first person in New Jersey to die with the coronavirus attended that family gathering. Grace Fusco has 11 children and 27 grandchildren, according to the report. ##Health## ##Daily Life##\u00a0 The numbers:\u00a0Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources, puts the total number of cases worldwide at more than 218,800, with at least 8,800 deaths. China reports no new domestic cases: For the first time, the country where the coronavirus pandemic began has announced no new locally transmitted infections -- a pivotal moment in the battle to contain Covid-19. All 34 new cases reported yesterday were imported from overseas. US deaths: 80% of coronavirus-related deaths in the US occurred in adults aged 65 and older, according to a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The US has at least 8,736\u00a0cases\u00a0and 149 deaths. UK ramps up measures: From Friday, schools across the UK will close until further notice. Northern Ireland\u2019s schools will close starting Monday. Dozens of London Underground stations will close after the government advised to stop non-essential social contact. An additional 10,000 military personnel will be placed \"at a higher readiness\" to support public services as part of a new coronavirus support force. The only continent without cases: US researchers and workers stationed in the Antarctic were screened for coronavirus prior to their deployment. About 100 people are in the Antarctic from the US and other countries. World under lockdown:\u00a0Millions across the world have been\u00a0put\u00a0under strict restrictions on travel and movement. The European Union has\u00a0closed its borders\u00a0for 30 days. And many US counties have issued \"shelter in place\" orders. Latest restrictions: Australia and New Zealand are both banning entry to foreign citizens and non-residents. Economy: The European Central Bank said it would spend $818 billion buying government debt and private securities to fight the coronavirus crash. South Korea is supplying 50 trillion won ($38.9 billion) in emergency funding to support small business.  Flights suspended:\u00a0Australian airline\u00a0Qantas\u00a0and its subsidiary\u00a0Jetstar\u00a0will suspend scheduled international flights from late March until at least the end of May.\u00a0Air Canada\u00a0will gradually suspend the majority of its international and US trans-border flights by March 31.\u00a0Ryanair\u00a0said it expects that \"most if not all\" its flights will be grounded by March 24. There were\u00a012,094 flight cancellations\u00a0worldwide on Wednesday. \u00a0 Thailand will require health certificates for all incoming travelers, the country\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority announced today. The order was issued Wednesday night.  Airlines will need to check if passengers have recent travel histories to certain high-risk areas, a health certificate issued within 72 hours stating that the passenger is not at risk of infection, and proof of medical insurance covering at least $100,000. ##Travel## Starting tonight, New Zealand will ban any foreign citizens from entering the country, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced in a news conference today. \u201cProtecting New Zealanders from Covid-19 is our number one priority. In recent days it has become increasingly clear that the spread of the virus in other parts of the world means we need to take even stronger border measures,\u201d Ardern said in a news release shortly after the conference.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision stops any tourist, or temporary visa holder such as students or temporary workers, from coming to and entering into New Zealand.\" The travel ban will now apply to those coming from the Pacific Islands, who had previously been exempt from restrictions. It will also close off travel between New Zealand and Australia for the majority of citizens in the two countries, who are typically able to travel back and forth without a visa. \u201cA small number of exemptions to the new measures can be sought for humanitarian reasons, essential health workers and citizens of Samoa and Tonga who need to travel to New Zealand for essential reasons,\" Ardern said. New Zealanders\u2019 partners, legal guardians or any dependent children traveling with them may also return. The threat of imported cases: The new measures come after the country reported eight new cases today, bringing the national total to 28. All the new infections are \"related to overseas travel,\" not locally transmitted, said the ministry. There is not yet any evidence of community transmission in the country. \u201cAll of the cases of Covid-19 identified in New Zealand relate to people travelling to New Zealand and bringing the virus with them \u2013 therefore we need to further restrict the risk of people bringing the virus into New Zealand,\" Ardern said in the release. UPDATE: This post was updated to accurately reflect the restrictions. ##Health## ##Travel## Starting tomorrow, Australia will no longer allow entry to non-Australian citizens or residents, unless they are direct family members of Australians, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced today. \"Tonight we will be resolving to move to a position where a travel ban will be placed on all non-residents, non-Australian citizens coming to Australia, and that will be in place from 9 p.m. tomorrow evening,\" said Morrison. He added that he had consulted with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on this travel ban to \"align\" their measures. Ardern also announced a travel ban for foreign citizens entering New Zealand today. \"We believe it is essential now to take the further step to ensure that we now no longer will not be allowing anyone, unless they are a resident or citizen or direct family member in those cases, as is applied to all the travel bans previously,\" Morrison said. He added that people with travel plans to Australia should use these next 24 hours to make alternative arrangements. Australians overseas can still return to the country, but will be subject to a 14-day isolation upon arrival. This comes as the country announced a rise in cases. Australia reported 111 new cases, bringing the national tally to 565, the country's Department of Health said today. Of the 565 total, 259 cases are considered to be \"overseas acquired\" -- imported from virus-hit countries like the US, Iran, Italy, and the UK.  Some 46 patients have recovered, and six have died. ##Health## ##Travel## The number of global novel coronavirus cases has surpassed 218,800, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources. The number of deaths worldwide stands at 8,810, according to the university's tally. China: On Wednesday, China reported 34 new cases -- all imported from overseas. The milestone of no new locally transmitted infections represents a turnaround for the Chinese government. China has a total of 80,928 cases and 3,245 deaths, with 70,420 patients recovered.  Italy: The country with the worst outbreak outside China announced its biggest single-day jump in new coronavirus cases Wednesday, increasing by 4,207 in 24 hours. The total number of cases now stands at 35,713 and 2,978 deaths, according to the WHO. Iran: Iran confirmed 147 new deaths from the coronavirus Wednesday, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll to 1,135. An additional 1,192 cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 17,361. Iran has been the epicenter of the outbreak in the Middle East. ##Health## El Salvador has reported its first case of the coronavirus, President Nayib Bukele said in a televised announcement on Wednesday.\u00a0 The infected patient had visited Italy and entered El Salvador through an \"unofficial point,\" according to the announcement.\u00a0 ##Health## While the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic\u00a0and climate change are inherently different issues, they share two important characteristics: both are global crises that threaten the lives of millions of people. Yet only one crisis has inspired widespread, drastic action from countries across the globe. As\u00a0Covid-19 spreads, countries\u00a0have been put into lockdown, schools closed, events canceled, factories shuttered, millions\u00a0told to\u00a0work\u00a0from home\u00a0and\u00a0emergency funds\u00a0released. No economic cost has been too big to stem the spread of the disease. Coronavirus is proving that it is possible to make dramatic changes and economic sacrifices to save lives. So why haven't governments done more to protect their citizens from the impact of climate change? The climate crisis is also a global health emergency. The virus' impact has been sudden and dramatic. The toll of the climate crisis is slow and steady -- but no less deadly. Air pollution kills 7 million people every year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the World Health Organization. A recent study found toxic air shortens lives worldwide\u00a0by nearly three years\u00a0on average. And the life of every child born today will be profoundly affected by climate change, according to\u00a0another report. We have the tools to adapt to climate change -- we don't need radical shutdowns like the world has seen for this pandemic. But climate scientists say\u00a0that adapting to climate change does not require radical shutdowns\u00a0-- the technology needed to reduce emissions already exists. Renewable energy sources are a cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels,\u00a0and making the switch makes economic sense. \"It's absolutely possible to completely transform our country and world economies in a way that's sustainable, in a way that would mitigate the risk,\" said Donna Green, associate professor at University of New South Wales' Climate Change Research Centre. Read the full analysis here: ##Health## Some 80% of coronavirus-related deaths in the US occurred in adults aged 65 and older, according to a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Wednesday. The report examined patient deaths that occurred between February 12 and March 16. Because of missing data about underlying health issues and other key characteristics, deaths were estimated as a range.  For adults aged 85 years and older, the death rate was highest, ranging from 10% to 27%. For adults aged 65 to 84, the range was 3% to 11%. No US deaths have occurred among people aged 19 years or younger.\u00a0\u00a0 The largest proportion of hospitalized patients were between 65 and 84 years old, contributing 36% of cases. They also made up the largest proportion of ICU patients, with 46% of cases. \u201cThe risk for serious disease and death in Covid-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age,\u201d the report said. \u201cSocial distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults.\u201d ##Health## Passing through airports in Hong Kong and Tokyo this week highlighted the differences in the approaches of the two Asian hubs in dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic. Arriving in Hong Kong: After disembarking directly onto the tarmac, we were taken to a quarantine area on the lower level of the airport. There we underwent multiple health and security checks. My temperature was taken, and I filled out a detailed questionnaire on my travel history. Quarantine officers gave me a checklist of instructions for after I left the airport, including that I take my temperature twice daily and immediately report any abnormal symptoms to the Department of Health. If I was to land in Hong Kong today, it would be even stricter. The local government announced this week that anyone arriving from a foreign country is required to self-quarantine for two weeks, and will likely be issued an electronic monitoring bracelet that will alert the authorities if they leave their home or hotel. Arriving in Tokyo: When I arrived at Narita airport in Japan this week our plane pulled up to the gate as usual. I walked freely through the airport, more than 500 meters to the quarantine office where about 10 quarantine officers hastily tried to process everybody who came from my flight. Nobody took my temperature, although I did walk past a thermal camera scanning for elevated body temperatures. But it was a cold evening and many passengers were bundled up in coats that could have hindered the camera's ability to get an accurate reading. My quarantine officer gave me forms to sign in English requesting that I remain in my home for 14 days, check my temperature daily, and avoid public transportation. These were simply requests, and are not being enforced. I am following the suggested protocol, but there is nothing to stop me from going anywhere I please. But without widespread testing, it's hard to know whether the calm in Tokyo is a true picture of the coronavirus situation in Japan -- or if it is actually the calm before the storm.

Mario Diaz-Balart,\u00a0a Republican from Florida, and\u00a0Rep. Ben McAdams,\u00a0a Democrat from Utah, confirmed earlier today that they had contracted the coronavirus. Republican Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri and Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida both issued statements tonight saying they were self-quarantining after coming into contact with an unnamed colleague who tested positive. They both said they have no symptoms. Republican Whip Steve Scalise is also self-quarantining because he held an \u201cextended meeting\u201d with Diaz-Balart. Scalise says he is not experiencing any symptoms. Rep. Drew Ferguson, a Republican from Georgia, is self-quarantining after \u201ccontact with a member of\u00a0Congress\u00a0on March 13 that has since tested positive for Covid-19.\u201d Ferguson does not say who the member is.  ##Health## The UK's Ministry of Defence announced today it would place an additional 10,000 military personnel \"at a higher readiness\" to support public services, as part of a new coronavirus support force. Higher readiness means the personnel are available within a certain time frame. The additional 10,000 personnel are on top of another 10,000 already in place. \u201cThe men and women of our Armed Forces stand ready to protect Britain and her citizens from all threats, including Covid-19,\" said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in a statement from the ministry.\u00a0 \"Defence is fully engaged with other government departments, the devolved administrations and local authorities to establish how best it can support over the coming weeks and months. Other measures include: 150 military personnel will be trained to drive oxygen tankers in order to support the National Health Service if required. \nScientists from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory are working with Public Health England to understand the virus and tackle the spread.\nThe military is providing specialist planners to Local Resilience Forums -- multi-agency partnerships -- to provide support for public services and local communities. \u00a0##Daily Life## US researchers and workers stationed in the Antarctic were screened for coronavirus prior to their deployment, according to a spokesperson from the National Science Foundation.  \"Currently, it's off season in Antartica so there's only a skeleton crew there now. Everyone currently on the ice was screened,\" NSF's Micheal England told CNN. He said there are about 100 people in the Antarctic from both the US and other countries, who are all hunkered down or preparing for the upcoming winter.\u00a0The summer season, when most workers and researchers will deploy, begins in October.\u00a0 When asked if the global pandemic would change their operations, England said, \"That's still to be determined officially at this point, but more than likely yes.\" Antarctica is the only continent left with no reported cases. ##Health## In the UK, the education system is grinding to a halt, with schools closing and national exams postponed amid the coronavirus crisis. All schools in the UK will shut on Friday \"until further notice,\" said UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson on Wednesday. Exceptions will be made for the children of \u201ckey workers\u201d and vulnerable children, including all children who have been assigned a social worker. The government is also setting up a national voucher system for free school meals for low income students, he said. Northern Ireland schools will also close starting Monday, potentially until the summer holidays, First Minister Arlene Foster said Wednesday. The national GCSE exams and A-level exams will also not take place this year in the UK, said Williamson. He added that he would make sure students\u2019 grades \u201creflected their work.\u201d \u00a0##Daily Life## Wuhan, the Chinese city at ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic, will need to see 14 consecutive days of no new cases before travel restrictions can be lifted, a top Chinese health expert told state media on Tuesday. Speaking to the state-run China Daily newspaper, Li Lanjuan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and senior adviser to the country\u2019s top health authority said: \u201cIf no new case of the coronavirus has been reported for 14 consecutive days in Wuhan following the last reported cases, we believe it will be a time when the lockdown can gradually be lifted.\u201d Mainland China has seen a steady decline in locally transmitted cases for weeks, even as numbers skyrocketed across the rest of the world. Today, China reported its first day of no new domestic cases since the outbreak started -- all new cases were imported from abroad. Wuhan had been reporting cases in the single digits leading up to today's announcement. The rest of the country has been slowly relaxing restrictions on people's movements in the past week, with highways reopening and quarantine stations closing.  Inter-provincial travel, which had previously been shut down entirely, is gradually resuming. People from other provinces are now allowed into Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, if they pass temperature checks and have the appropriate \"health codes\" -- color-coded passes that indicate permission to travel. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## ##Health## Nearly 10 million California residents are under a mandatory \"shelter in place\" order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Shelter in place means residents are required to remain at home except for essential needs like picking up groceries, medication, or caring for someone in another household. The orders are being enforced by law enforcement. Where the order has been issued: Solano County and Lake County in Northern California have now joined other Bay Area counties and cities, which include\u00a0Alameda, Contra Costa, the City of Fresno, Marin, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, and Yolo counties. Solano County\u2019s shelter in place order, which began today, will be in effect until April 7. The order for Lake County begins on Thursday and ends on April 10. The City of Palm Springs in Southern California\u2019s Riverside County issued its order to begin Wednesday through April 2, with a possible extension if needed. The 17 jurisdictions across the state encompass approximately 9.67 million Californians, according to a US Census count. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## NBA spokesman Mike Bass said today that eight full NBA teams have been tested because of the \"unique working conditions.\" Seven players have tested positive so far, he said. Here's what he said:  \u201cPositive test results for the coronavirus are provided to public health authorities and released publicly only by order of those authorities or the individuals themselves. NBA teams are working with their physicians, local and state health departments, and other medical experts, to coordinate the proper care around this virus for players and team staff.\u00a0\nOnce there were some players who tested positive, because of the unique working conditions of NBA players, team physicians and infectious disease experts looked at the situation of each team, made individual determinations, and the recommendation was to have eight other full teams tested.\u00a0As of now, seven total players have tested positive.\u201d The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraging live-streaming funerals  as an alternative to in-person gatherings, as the pandemic sends cities and states into lockdown. The Trump administration has urged people to avoid groups of 10 or more to reduce the spread of the coronavirus -- and the CDC offered guidance to the National\u00a0Funeral\u00a0Directors Association about alternatives. \u201cFor example, if live-streaming and limiting in-person attendance to immediate family is possible, we encourage that. Additionally, promoting social distancing at the event, regardless of size, and promoting hand hygiene as well is also important,\u201d David Berendes, an environmental epidemiologist with the CDC, said during the briefing. \u201cSocial distancing, hand hygiene and other common sense measures would apply to those events and you may consider limiting the number of high risks individuals who are attending the event to those who are absolutely necessary,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 How to deal with the threat of infected bodies: In late February, the CDC\u00a0issued guidance for\u00a0funeral\u00a0directors, medical examiners and pathologists on how to handle the bodies of people who have died from the coronavirus. Funeral\u00a0home workers should follow routine infection and control precautions when handling the bodies, the agency said. There are no known risks of being in the same room as a patient who has died -- but it's such a new disease that health experts are still learning how it spreads.  \u201cIf washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and\u00a0funeral\u00a0home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible,\" said Dr. Sarah Reagan-Steiner, a medical officer with the infectious disease pathology branch at the CDC.\u00a0 ##Health## ##Daily Life## Mainland China on Thursday reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the first time since the the pandemic began, marking a major turning point in the global battle to contain Covid-19. The country reported 34 new cases of coronavirus yesterday -- all imported from overseas. The milestone represents a turnaround for the Chinese government.\u00a0Just last month, mainland China was reporting thousands of cases per day, and was considered the most high-risk infection area in the world. Now, after months of lockdowns and travel restrictions affecting hundreds of millions of citizens, strict home quarantines, and an unprecedented nationwide effort, the country is down to zero reported new locally transmitted cases. Instead, the threat is now coming from overseas. The number of cases and deaths outside China have exploded in the past two weeks, with the pandemic hitting the US and Europe particularly hard. If China is any model to go by, these countries could have months to go before reaching zero new local transmissions. Places like mainland China and Hong Kong are now bracing for a potential second wave of infections, as people return from overseas, bringing the virus with them. China also reported eight new deaths yesterday, according to the National Health Commission. The country now has a total of 80,928 cases and 3,245 deaths. ##Health## The European Central Bank announced today a huge new money-printing program aimed at keeping the region's financial system functioning and helping the economy cope with the pandemic. The central bank said it would spend \u20ac750 billion ($818 billion) buying government debt and private securities before the end of 2020 -- and it stands ready to do even more if necessary. \"The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programs and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed,\" the ECB said in a statement. What the program will do: That massive increase to the central bank's balance sheet, known as quantitative easing, is designed to keep the financial system liquid when investors are running scared.  Europe's central bank \"will explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy through this shock,\" the ECB said in a statement.  Markets are plummeting: Global stocks have plunged deep into a bear market, and central banks around the world are engaging in emergency stimulus plans to bolster their economies and markets in the face of a potentially disastrous worldwide recession. Large parts of Europe are under lockdown as the virus rampages through the region. Industries such as carmaking and aviation have almost completely shut down, while many shops, bars, restaurants and other public venues have been forced to close.
