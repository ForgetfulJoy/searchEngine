The impressive building is regularly used in blockbuster films and has become an iconic national treasure.

The 50-year-old Ganz UV tram mainly circulates on tram line 2, but it does run on other lines in other parts of the city.  No special tickets are needed to ride the tram, standard tickets are valid for travel. There are no services on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. Tram tickets cost 380 HUF (around $1.35) 7.
