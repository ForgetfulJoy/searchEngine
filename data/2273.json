Find all of our coronavirus-related coverage here and let us know your thoughts here. To ensure our safety and health and to stop the spread of coronavirus, people everywhere are being asked to stay indoors. And though some much-needed downtime is appreciated, after a while, typically busy people become bored. Rather than binge-watching another Netflix series, look around your home for small tweaks to try. These mini projects are a helpful and productive distraction from the news \u2014 and they'll breathe new life into your home. From replacing your lampshades to wallpapering, you can try these ideas straight from interior designers to help pass the time.  Create more storage in your kitchen cabinets  During times of uncertainty, people crave structure and order, says interior designer Kevin Isbell. And since many of us are at home, this is a great time to tackle the most cluttered area of our homes: the kitchen.  With cans here, fresh produce there and not enough space, Isbell suggests getting creative with your storage solutions. You can do this by adding pull-out drawers in each of your lower cabinets to create more spots for more items. Not only is it easy \u2014 just a few screws and a screwdriver \u2014 but you'll also be amazed by the difference it makes in fighting clutter.

While you probably want to ensure everyone in your home is on board before going all in on this project, a quick coat of paint allows you to redesign the overall theme of the heart of your home. For a subtle approach, try a muted green or calming blue. They are both soothing, but still different enough to shake up the style.

But Kelly Dunn, the founder and CEO of Fathom Design Company, says switching our shades can instantly shift our perspective and perception of our home.  \"Seeing something new where your eyes were accustomed to the same thing every day is exciting in its simplicity,\" she says. If you'd like to update your shades with a new purchase, Dunn says to make sure the item has similar dimensions: \"Don't stray farther than 2-3 inches wider or narrower, and make sure it is the same height,\" she recommends.

Instead, stimulate your mind and supercharge your competitiveness by playing games with quarantined housemates. Raf Howery, the CEO of Kukun, suggests taking a corner of your living room, or even part of a spare bedroom, and making a bona fide game room.  \"Take a table that you already have at home and create a designated play space in your house to entertain your family and remove any of the pressure that comes from feeling stuck at home,\" he says.

Though some folks aren't able to enjoy the beauty of the great outdoors these days, Dunn says anyone can bring the hope and color of spring inside.  \"Create a centerpiece that replicates a family time capsule using a decorative trough and filling it with favorite books, plants, flowers, fruit, old photos and gadgets,\" she suggests. To make sure that you don't overcrowd your design, Dunn says to start with spacing the larger items first and then filling in with the smaller items.

Access to daily vitamin D and the ability to breathe fresh air creates a much-needed break from the indoors. Now that you have the time, Lawson suggests investing in ways to make this space cozy.  \"It is important to carve out a peaceful outdoor room where you can enjoy nature in a socially distancing--friendly way,\" he says. \"Set up a few chairs around a fire pit or chiminea for an evening marshmallow roasting session.\"  Try this: Alois Chaise Lounge Set with Cushion and Table ($355.99; wayfair.com) _______________________________________________________________________________  Patch up the little stuff Those holes in the wall from a DIY project gone wrong.

Drywall Repair Patch Kit ($8.22; homedepot.com) _______________________________________________________________________________  Replace standard light fixtures with decorative ones If you've had the same light fixture since you first moved into your pad, take the opportunity to browse online and change chandeliers, pendants, sconces and other varieties that speak to you. As Lawson shares, by following instructions, it can be easy and fast to replace the old with the new.  \"Choose a fixture that goes with the style of your home. If you live in a Spanish home, shop for glass lanterns. If you live in a brand new loft, go for something minimal and modern,\" he says.
