Think again. Americans spent a record-breaking $7.4 billion in online purchases on Black Friday alone, and another $4.2 billion on Thanksgiving Day. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. London Bridge terror attack London has had a weekend to process Friday's stabbing attack that ended with two people dead, three others injured and a city on edge. The suspect, Usman Khan, was shot dead by police after attacking a crowd of people gathered for a Cambridge University event at Fishmonger's Hall\u00a0on the north side of London Bridge. Khan, 28, had a history of terrorist activity.\u00a0In 2010, he\u00a0and eight others were arrested in London as part of a major counterterrorism operation, and authorities said he once planned to start a \"terrorist military training facility.\" The attack raises concerning questions about what to do with convicted terrorists once they have served their sentences. Khan had been out of jail for a year at the time of the attack. How can law enforcement and intelligence communities know who is at risk to re-offend, and how effective are deradicalization programs at preventing further violence? 2. Impeachment investigation The House Judiciary Committee will hold its first impeachment hearing on Wednesday, but President Trump and his attorneys\u00a0will not attend. The White House made the announcement last night, saying they weren't given enough information about who will be there and can't be sure the President will be subject to a \"fair process.\" While the White House hasn't ruled out future appearances at these hearings, the decision is in line with the Republican's tight-lipped impeachment strategy: Key players like former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney have refused to testify, despite some Republicans claiming their testimony could actually help the President. Now the House Intelligence Committee will kick off a lightning-fast sprint to get a House impeachment vote on the books by Christmas. Members are expected to review the committee's impeachment report today ahead of a vote to approve it on Tuesday. 3. Winter weather\u00a0 All of those severe storms we warned you about last week made for an absolutely hellish travel weekend, and many parts of the country are bracing for more. Yesterday, icy conditions caused a plane to slip off the runway upon landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Severe fog and storms were\u00a0blamed for a 25-vehicle pileup on\u00a0Garrett County, Maryland. On Saturday, nine people were killed when a plane crashed in Chamberlain, South Dakota, during blizzard-like conditions. As of this morning, more than 7,500 flights have been delayed within the past day, and delays will continue through today. About 50 million Americans are under some sort of winter weather alert, whether it's blizzard-like conditions in the Great Lakes region, heavy snow in the Midwest, snow and flooding on the West Coast, or your garden variety winter ugliness in the Northeast. If we've said it once, we've said it a million times: Be careful out there! 4. Immigration\u00a0 Horror stories of kidnapping and other dangers are coming out of camps in Mexican border towns where thousands of migrants are being kept while awaiting word from the US on their bids for asylum. Letters obtained by CNN from some of the camps reveal a near-constant threat of violence, sexual assault\u00a0and kidnapping\u00a0from Mexican cartels who target newly-arrived migrants form Central America. One asylum-seeker said the cartels can tell who has just been returned from the US by their lace-less shoes and the telltale manila case folders and documents they carry.\u00a0About 60,000 migrants have\u00a0been returned to Mexico under the Trump Administration's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which requires asylum seekers to wait outside of US borders while their cases are processed. 5. Malta Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has announced he will resign in January due to an ongoing investigation into the death of a prominent Maltese journalist\u00a0and activist two years ago.\u00a0Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, was killed by a car bomb in 2017. Her family says she was assassinated for her work in uncovering alleged corruption in the Maltese government, and that Muscat had sought to protect members of his inner circle as the investigation into her death deepened. Many think Muscat faces a conflict of interest in the case, since he is both leading the investigation and tied to the victim at the center of it. In a statement, Muscat said the political and legal pressures of the case led to his decision to resign.
