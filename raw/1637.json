Other major US indexes also declined in premarket trading. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures each fell 0.8%. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier that a resident of Solano County, California, tested positive for the virus without having \"relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient.\" They warned that the case could indicate that the virus has begun moving through a community in the United States for the first time.  The CDC announcement also came as President Donald Trump tried to assuage fears about the outbreak. At a press conference Wednesday, he defended the White House's response to the disease and stressed that the administration has resources devoted to combating the virus. Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of the government's plan, he added. CDC officials, though, have told Americans that health experts foresee the virus spreading in the United States.  The coronavirus has killed at least 2,800 people worldwide and infected 81,700. While the vast majority of cases have been recorded in mainland China, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica, sparking alarm. More than a dozen cases have been recorded in the United States. Stock markets this week \u2014 many of which had been brushing off the virus \u2014 have been rattled by fears about how the virus could hurt the global economy and wreak havoc on supply chains.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's biggest brewer, was the latest big company to warn about the negative impact of the coronavirus. The maker of Budweiser estimated that the outbreak would result in lost sales of $285 million in China over the first two months of 2020. Danone and Diageo issued similar warnings on Wednesday. Asian markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 2.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.3%. South Korea's Kospi fell 1%. "], "Language": false}
