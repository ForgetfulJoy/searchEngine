Bernie Sanders on Tuesday defended his past praise of social programs implemented by the late Cuban dictator\u00a0Fidel Castro,\u00a0and insisted he opposes authoritarianism.  \"I have opposed\u00a0authoritarianism all over the\u00a0world,\" Sanders said at the Democratic primary debate in South Carolina.  The senator then turned to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who moments earlier said Chinese President Xi Jinping has an \"enormous amount of power\" but serves at the behest of the Politburo. The Politburo of the Communist Party of China is an elite council of leaders in the party and one step above is the Politburo Standing Committee, a smaller and even more powerful body.  \"I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago,\" Sanders said. \"He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the Politburo, but who the hell is the Politburo responsive to? Who elects the Politburo? You got a real dictatorship there.\" Sanders\u00a0faced a wave of bipartisan criticism after he praised a literacy program the Cuban government launched in its first years and asserted to CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that \"it's unfair to simply say everything is bad\" with the way Castro ruled the country. Over parts of five decades, Sanders more than any other national political figure has engaged and, at times, defended the Cuban government, Daniel Ortega's Nicaragua and other controversial leaders across Latin America and Russia. These views mark a stark break from the foreign policy consensus that dominated American political circles since the end of World War II. Sanders said at the debate that his comments on Cuba echoed what former President Barack Obama said about education and health care in the country. Obama struck a deal to reopen diplomatic relations and re-establish some trade with Cuba after a more than a half century of estrangement, and became the first sitting president to visit Cuba since 1959.  \"What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. That was Barack Obama,\" Sanders said.  He continued, \"Occasionally, it might be a good\u00a0idea to be honest about American\u00a0foreign policy, and that\u00a0includes the fact that America\u00a0has overthrown governments all\u00a0over the world in Chile, in\u00a0Guatemala, in Iran, and\u00a0when dictatorships, whether the\u00a0Chinese or the Cubans, do\u00a0something good, you acknowledge\u00a0that, but you don't have to trade\u00a0love letters with them.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden jumped in and said Obama \"did not in any\u00a0way suggest that there was\u00a0anything positive about the\u00a0Cuban\u00a0government.\"  \"(Obama) acknowledged that they did\u00a0increase life expectancy, but he\u00a0went on and condemned the\u00a0dictatorship, he went on and\u00a0condemned the people who, in\u00a0fact, had run that committee,\" he said.  Biden said, \"The fact of the\u00a0matter is (Obama), in fact, does not,\u00a0did not, has never embraced an\u00a0authoritarian regime and does\u00a0not now.\" Sanders started saying, \"Authoritarianism of any stripe\u00a0is bad --\"  \"Period,\" Biden interjected.   \"-- but that is different than\u00a0saying governments occasionally\u00a0do things that are good,\" Sanders said.
