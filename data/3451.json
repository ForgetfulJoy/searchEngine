New York City is currently reporting\u00a056,289\u00a0coronavirus cases and\u00a01,867\u00a0deaths,\u00a0according to the city\u2019s website. Friday\u2019s\u00a0new totals mark an increase of 6,582 cases and 305 deaths since\u00a0Thursday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement Friday that they have obligated $1.1 billion in federal support to New York state. \"Total medical supplies and equipment provided to New York include 1,096,922 N95 respirators, 1,836,891 surgical masks, 365,295 face shields, 219,811 surgical gowns, 8,059 coveralls, 1,435,129 gloves and 4,400 ventilators,\" FEMA said in a statement. New York has 102,987 confirmed coronavirus cases and 2,935 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Despite recent support from members of his coronavirus task force for a nationwide stay-at-home order, President Trump said Friday he'd \"leave it up to the governors.\"  As justification for this decision, Trump claimed the states currently without stay-at-home orders are \"not in jeopardy.\" Facts First:\u00a0It's not true that the eight states without stay-at-home orders at the time of the President's remarks are \"not in jeopardy\" or at risk from the coronavirus. Though they are not current \"hot spots of the virus,\" all of them are dealing with at least 100\u00a0reported\u00a0cases and 1/4 of them have over 1,000 cases. Missouri,\u00a0South Carolina, Utah, Iowa, Arkansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and Wyoming did not have statewide stay-at-home orders\u00a0in place\u00a0as of Friday evening. Although South Dakota, North Dakota and Wyoming are among the five states with the least amount of cases in the US, South Carolina and Utah have 1,554 and 1,095 cases respectively.\u00a0 Missouri\u2019s stay-at-home order goes into effect Monday. The state had at least\u00a01,864 cases before Gov. Mike Parson issued the order Friday evening. The USNS Comfort, a hospital ship docked in New York City, will now take patients aboard that are not showing symptoms of Covid-19, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency fact sheet on the ship. Previously, patients had to have a negative test from their discharging hospital before being admitted on to the ship. The change in procedure was done in an effort to bring more patients aboard the USNS Comfort.\u00a0 Patients who are brought aboard the ship without symptoms of Covid-19 will be isolated and tested upon arrival. Any patient that tests positive for coronavirus will be transferred to a hospital that is treating Covid-19 patients, according to the FEMA fact sheet. The USNS Comfort will also begin taking patients from the Javits Federal Medical Center so the Javits location can being treating Covid-19 patients. \u00a0 President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both stumbled over medical details, and spread inaccurate information, while touting new coronavirus tests and potential treatments. Trump mentioned anti-malaria drugs that are being tested as potential treatments, saying that the clinical trials are \u201chaving some good results,\u201d even though public health officials say the results are months away. Moments later, Vice President Mike Pence said the Food and Drug Administration had \u201capproved\u201d a new method to test the coronavirus, even though the FDA only granted emergency authorization for the test, which requires a much lower standard. Facts First:\u00a0Both comments overstate the medical realities a bit. For Trump, he has repeatedly touted and expressed unbridled optimism about the drugs, even without conclusive scientific data to back up his claims. For Pence, he oversold the FDA\u2019s confidence in the new Covid-19 test.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In recent weeks, Trump has\u00a0repeatedly touted two pharmaceuticals, chloroquine and the chemically similar hydroxychloroquine, as potential \u201cgame-changers\u201d that could end the pandemic and save lives. This is the continuation of a glaring messaging gap within the administration. Trump has breathlessly promoted the drugs while the public health officials are cautiously waiting for scientific evidence, and tamping down expectations, by saying that the information out there already is only anecdotal and not proven on a large-scale. Later in the press conference, Pence brought up the\u00a0new blood test\u00a0for coronavirus antibodies.\u00a0\u201cAnd the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA, once again, in near record time, has approved an antibody test developed by Cellex,\u201d Pence said. This isn\u2019t quite accurate. The FDA uses very specific terminology about medical drugs, tests and equipment, and the FDA would likely disagree with the notion that it \u201capproved\u201d the test.\u00a0These terms are important, as medical professionals need clarity to be sure their use of these items is safe for every patient. What really happened was that the FDA granted \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d for the tests. This essentially means that the FDA will let health care providers use the tests during this crisis, even though it hasn\u2019t gone through all the steps that medicines and medical tests usually go through before receiving a full \u201capproval.\" President Trump said Friday that he could not assure the state of New York will have enough ventilators to deal with coronavirus patients, after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state is days away from running out of the lifesaving machines. Asked during a White House press briefing whether he could assure that the state would have enough ventilators, Trump said, \u201cNo, they should have had more ventilators at the time.\u201d \u201cThey should have had more ventilators. They were totally underserviced. We are trying to do \u2014 we are doing our best for New York,\u201d Trump continued. Trump added that the White House thinks Cuomo is \u201cwell served with ventilators. We\u2019re going to find out, but we have other states to take care of.\u201d \u201cI wish they did the original orders (for ventilators) three years ago. They would have had all the ventilators they needed,\u201d Trump continued, before adding, \u201cAlthough, even then they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Some context: On Monday, Trump told reporters that he thinks every American who may need a ventilator in the next few weeks will have access to one. \u201cI do think so, yes,\u201d Trump told a reporter in the White House Rose Garden.\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be in very good shape.\u201d\u00a0 ##Health## Maine Gov. Janet Mills issued an executive order today mandating that travelers coming into Maine, regardless of their state of residency, self-quarantine for 14 days to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, according to a release from the governor\u2019s office. \u201cTo slow the spread of this deadly virus and prevent our health care system from being overwhelmed, we must all do our part,\u201d Mills said in the release. \u201cI am mandating that anyone entering Maine self-quarantine for 14 days and abide by Maine\u2019s Stay Healthy at Home Order. These actions will protect the health and safety of everyone.\u201d ##Health## The United States Tennis Association (USTA) said it believes that when it comes to playing tennis, \"it is in the best interest of society to take a collective pause from playing the sport we love.\" \"Medical advisors believe there is the possibility that the virus responsible for COVID-19 could be transmitted through common sharing and handling of tennis balls, gate handles, benches, net posts and even court surfaces,\" the USTA statement said Friday. There are at least\u00a0273,880\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and 7,077\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the country. So far on Friday,\u00a028,667\u00a0new cases and\u00a01,094\u00a0deaths have been reported, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins.\u00a0 The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all\u00a0repatriated cases.  Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. When asked by CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta about the level of preparedness for a pandemic like Covid-19, President Trump said while he knew pandemics were \u201cone of the worst things that could happen ... most people thought it wouldn\u2019t and most people didn\u2019t understand the severity of it.\u201d Trump was responding to Acosta's question about Department of Health and Human Services Sec. Alex Azar saying in April 2019 that a \u201cpandemic flu\u201d is what kept him up most at night. Trump said he didn't think Azar \u201cwas speaking about a specific pandemic,\u201d adding, \u201cI always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen.\u201d \u201cMost people thought it wouldn\u2019t and most people didn\u2019t understand the severity of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI assume he was talking about the possibility.\u201d When pressed by Acosta on why the administration doesn\u2019t have enough PPE supplies, Trump blamed it on previous administration, and once again repeated the false claim that the Obama administration left the military with no ammunition. Read more about Azar's comments last year from CNN's KFile. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Friday issued a statewide stay-at-home order effective Monday, April 6 until Friday, April 24, 2020. The order stated individuals living in Missouri must avoid leaving their homes or places of residence unless necessary. Like many state\u2019s stay-at-home orders, it does not prohibit people from going out for \u201cessential services,\u201d such as grocery stores, gas stations, banks or outdoor recreation, as long as precautions are taken and social distancing requirements are met.  Most US states and DC have some kind of stay-at-home order in place.  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said his state has limited personal protective equipment. \"We try to buy. It\u2019s really hard,\" he said. \"The federal government buys most all of it.\u201d He said that while the state is trying to manufacture PPE, he also asked residents of his state to donate any available PPE supplies. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday that he has had extensive conversations with Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Defense on how to respond to the growing number of deaths in NYC. De Blasio said more than 100 federal personnel, including members of the military, have been sent to NYC with necessary equipment to \u201chelp deal with this crisis on the mortuary side.\u201d De Blasio also said they will hire more personnel as needed to \u201caddress this very painful reality.\u201d ##Health## Some public health experts at the US Centers for Disease Control felt \"pressured\"\u00a0by the White House to\u00a0draft\u00a0recommendations that all Americans wear masks or facial coverings while in public, according to a senior federal health official involved in discussions.\u00a0 A source told CNN the \"CDC was under intense pressure to do this quickly.\"\u00a0 \"The CDC would not have gone this direction if not for the White House,\" the senior official told CNN.\u00a0\"We would have tried more to understand about asymptomatic transmission. We would have done more studies if we had more time.\"\u00a0 \"It was more than we were comfortable with, the source added. \"Things were done very fast. It's a credibility risk to the agency. It's not fabulous for credibility. There is a real worry that this will provide a false sense of security to the public. Also, up until now the CDC has been telling people it's okay not to wear a mask, and it's going to be recommended that we do. It runs the risk of confusing the public.\" President Trump again signaled his resistance to issuing a national stay-at-home order to slow the spread of coronavirus, despite comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci this week questioning why such an order has not been issued for all states. The majority of states have issued orders for their residents to stay in their homes, but the federal government has not mandated people do so. \u201cI leave it up to the governors,\u201d Trump said at the coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cI guess we\u2019re close to 90 percent anyway,\u201d Trump said of the number of people mandated to stay home. At least 41 states and the District of Columbia have issued stay-at-home orders. \u201cStates that we\u2019re talking about are not in jeopardy,\u201d Trump said, referring to the handful of states that have not yet issued these orders. \u201cI like that from the standpoint of governing, and even from the standpoint of our Constitution,\u201d the President said of his inclination to allow states to make their own decisions about ordering people not to leave their houses. The federal government has issued guidance recommending that people stay home to the extent possible and avoid gathering in groups larger than 10. \u00a0Watch: The US coronavirus death toll reached\u00a07,077\u00a0on Friday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University. The increase of\u00a01,094\u00a0deaths today is the most number of deaths in a single day. The previous record for the most new coronavirus deaths added in a single day as reported by CNN was\u00a0946\u00a0on Wednesday. Five infants have tested positive for coronavirus in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan said at a press conference Friday afternoon.  The youngest of the infants is just one-month-old, Hogan said.  \u201cThe reality is that this disease does not discriminate, and no one is immune,\" he said. New York's Central Park field hospital is already at half capacity on its third day treating Covid-19 patients, according to the director of the facility. There are currently 34 patients being treated there, including four in their ICU, and it's expected the pop-up hospital will reach its 68-bed capacity in the next few days, according to Dr. Elliott Tenpenny, director of the international heath unit for Samaritan\u2019s Purse. Tenpenny says that while all the patients are adults, they are comprised of all ages, and many of them have severe shortage of breath and a need for oxygen.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s worse than I expected to see,\u201d Tenpenny said. The patients are from Mt. Sinai hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens, whose emergency rooms were overrun with patients with nowhere to go.\u00a0 Tenpenny says the patients will likely take 2-3 weeks to recover. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson defied calls to put his state under a stay-a-home order, one of only nine states remaining without such a directive.\u00a0 He argued that his \u201ctargeted approach\u201d is \u201ca good approach for Arkansas.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that (Dr. Anthony Fauci) looks at that as a solution, a nationwide shutdown order. What\u2019s important is that has not been given. The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) \u2014 I watch their guidelines regularly \u2014 and they have not indicated that\u2019s an appropriate or necessary step across the country. And so we\u2019ll continue to look at those guidelines that\u2019s offered from the federal level.\u201d Arkansas currently has at least 687\u00a0confirmed cases of coronavirus and at least 12 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. President Donald Trump said he\u2019s invoking the Defense Production Act \u201cto prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency will work together through this directive \u201cto prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, glove and other personal protective equipment,\u201d Trump said during a White House press briefing. \u201cWe need these items immediately for domestic use. We have to have them,\u201d Trump added. Peter Navarro, the White House\u2019s Defense Production Act policy coordinator previewed this action on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Watch: Lenders aren't the only ones frustrated with the rollout of the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program on Friday \u2014 small business owners reported that they were having a hard time finding a bank to approve their loan applications, according to one industry group. Adam Temple, the vice president of Public Affairs at the National Federation of Independent Business, told CNN that for the entire day Friday, his group had been inundated with stories about small business owners who were struggling to find a bank that would accept their loan application.\u00a0 With some banks choosing not to process the loans or delaying their rollout, some business owners were forced to go to a new bank to get a loan, and then finding that those new bank had a requirement that they already had to be an existing customer.  The process was anxiety inducing for business owners who were watching the Treasury Secretary tweet out every few hours how much money had already been distributed by the loan program, Temple said.\u00a0 \u201cIn many cases, the bank where they are a customer tells them they\u2019re not doing it, forcing them to try elsewhere and they\u2019re running into that issue \u2013 that they\u2019re not an existing customer. So they can\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d Temple said. \u201c We did a webinar at noon and had 7,000 small business owners log in. They\u2019re also calling us directly, almost all with some version of the same issue.\" President Trump announced new guidance from the White House on Friday afternoon, saying the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were advising the use of \"non-medical cloth based\" face coverings. Trump emphasized the recommendations were voluntary and that he, for one, would not partake. \"I don't think I'm going to be doing it,\" Trump said. After weeks of insisting Americans should not wear face masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus \u2014 and even suggesting their use could increase the chance of infection \u2014 administration officials this week engaged in a heated internal debate over reversing course, according to people familiar with the matter. Behind the scenes, officials were divided about the wisdom of advising Americans to cover their faces in public, which some fear could cause a lapse in the social distancing efforts that remain officials' best hope of preventing further spread. Watch: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a blunt warning to the Trump administration on Friday saying that forbidding 3M from shipping crucial supplies of N95 masks to Canada \"could hurt Americans as much as anybody else.\"\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve been working very closely with the Americans to highlight what Canadians know very, very well; that the level of integrations between our economies goes both ways across the border,\" he said during his daily press conference. \"That we are receiving essential supplies from the United States, but the United States also receives essential supplies and products and indeed healthcare professionals from Canada very single day.\"\u00a0 The United States and Canada mutually agreed to close the border to all except essential traffic and commercial trade in March.\u00a0 Delta Air Lines expects revenue over the next three months to be down 90% with no end of the industry's troubles in sight. \"Even as Delta is burning more than $60 million in cash every day, we know we still haven't seen the bottom,\" CEO Ed Bastian warned employees in a memo on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0 He said April's schedule will be \"at least 80% smaller than originally planned, with 115,000 flights canceled.\" As an example of the drop in traffic, Bastian said that on March 28, Delta carried only 38,000 customers.\u00a0Normal late-March Saturday traffic is 600,000. \"I wish I could predict this would end soon, but the reality is we simply don't know how long it will take before the virus is contained and customers are ready to fly again,\" Bastian said. He confirmed that on Friday, Delta filed for its share of $25 billion in federal grants allocated to the airline industry and approved by Congress last week. ##Travel## ##Business## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called upon President Trump during a Friday press conference to start a \u201cnational enlistment effort\u201d for medical personnel across the country and to have the US military coordinate that effort. \u201cRight now there are doctors and nurses and other medical professionals all over the country going about their normal lives and they\u2019re doing good work. But a lot of them could be freed up in a crisis to help save lives. And the lives to be saved are right here in New York City,\u201d de Blasio said. De Blasio called for an effort \u201cto recruit doctors, nurses, and medical professionals from all over the country, send them rapidly where they're needed most and then move them rapidly to the next biggest problem, the next biggest challenge. And what we will do, and I know every other city and state will do the same, is we will then offer our personnel to go to the next front to help as well.\u201d De Blasio said the US military could organize the effort because they have \u201cthe ability to put together a national structure to mobilize these medical personnel and ensure they get where they need to go rapidly and to make sure the priorities are right.\u201d De Blasio said: \"It's time for the commander in chief to give the order. If we\u2019re fighting a war, let\u2019s act like we\u2019re fighting a war. Right now, there\u2019s a peacetime approach in Washington and that won\u2019t cut it.\" President Trump has approved a disaster declaration for Arkansas in response to coronavirus.  This is the 39th\u00a0such declaration he has made in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including 34 states, the\u00a0US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Arkansas has at least 687 confirmed coronavirus cases and at least 12 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Short term rentals in South Carolina \u2014 including hotels, motels, rental houses, Airbnbs and time shares \u2014 are now prohibited to travelers coming from Covid-19 hotspots, the state\u2019s Gov. Henry McMaster announced today.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The state had 147 new cases confirmed in the last 24 hours for a total of 1,700 total cases.\u00a0 McMaster has also announced the closing of more non-essential businesses including furniture and clothing stores, florists, book stores, craft and music stores, effective Monday, April 6,\u00a0at 5 p.m.\u00a0\u00a0 Grocery stores, home improvement stores, gas stations and firearm retailers will remain open, McMaster said.\u00a0 McMaster was pressed by several reporters about his decision to not order a stay-at-home order and he said the orders he\u2019s already put in place address many of the things that would make them stay home.  \u201cSouth Carolina is unique,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe are doing what we feel is the most aggressive thing we can do to combat this virus.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ##Daily Life## ##Business## Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced a statewide stay-at-home order effective Saturday afternoon.\u00a0 \"My fellow Alabamians, I want to get straight to the point. Effective tomorrow afternoon at 5 p.m., I am mandating a stay-at-home order for the entire state,\" Ivey said during a press conference Friday afternoon in Montgomery. Before Friday, Alabama was one of the few states that had yet to issue a stay-at-home order. Alabama has at least 1,349 cases of coronavirus and at least 34 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said his state does not have enough tests for coronavirus.  \u201cWe do not have enough tests. The federal government said they were going to provide millions of tests, and all the states relied upon that promise, and it still hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Pritzker said when asked about the levels of coronavirus testing in his state in a press conference Friday afternoon. He said that Illinois is doing about 5,000 tests a day, but hope to get to 10,000. The increase on tests would provide better data and hone in on testing potential outbreak areas, Pritzker added. \u201cRight now, the testing supplies, the swabs, everything about the tests are very difficult to come by and there\u2019s no federal plan for this so every state is on their own \u2013 as I\u2019ve said it\u2019s the wild west out here,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Massachusetts has reported 1,436 new coronavirus cases and 38 new deaths today,\u00a0according to the state website. The state now has a total of 10,402 cases and 192 deaths. ##Health## About 15% of Texans diagnosed with coronavirus have been hospitalized, Gov. Greg Abbott said during a Friday afternoon press conference. There are currently 5,478 people who have tested positive in the state and 827 of them are hospitalized, Abbott said.\u00a0 So far, 91 people have died, according to Abbott. The state is working to identify alternative sites for medical treatment but currently has more than 19,000 hospital beds and 2,000 ICU beds available, he said. The state received additional personal protective gear including 1.4 million face masks and 190,000 face shields, Abbott said.\u00a0 ##Health## President Trump is being urged to consider calling for nationwide stay-at-home recommendations, something he has so far refused to do, a\u00a0source close to the White House Coronavirus Task Force says\u00a0tells CNN.\u00a0 Among the officials nudging the President to embrace such a move is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the source said. On Thursday night during CNN's Town Hall on the coronavirus pandemic, Fauci said it's time for every state in the country to have stay-at-home orders.\u00a0 \"If you look at what's going on in this country, I just don't understand why we're not doing that.\u00a0We really should be,\" Fauci said. Separately, a White House official tells CNN that the task force is looking to issue mask guidelines at Friday's White House briefing.\u00a0 The official said it's possible the mask guidelines could slide until Saturday, but the briefing is expected to delve into masks today.\u00a0 President Trump, Vice President Pence, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Deborah Birx are all\u00a0expected to attend the official said.\u00a0 ##Health## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said today that the federal government has provided 200,000 N95 masks that have been given to the NYC public hospital system. De Blasio said he spoke to President Trump and Jared Kushner and thanked them for the masks. Two more Harris County Sheriff's Office employees have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of employees infected to 15, a press release from the Sheriff's Office said Friday. One employee is a deputy in her late 40s and the other is a detention officers in her late 30s, according to the release. Harris County is home to the city of Houston and located in southeastern Texas. Both employees were assigned to work at a county jail, the release said. By the numbers: So far, 178 employees of the sheriff's office are currently on quarantine due to possible exposure to the virus and one is hospitalized, according to the release. Three inmates at the jail have also tested positive and 33 more are in quarantine with symptoms awaiting test results, the release said.\u00a0 ##Health## Gov. Mark Gordon announced today Wyoming its order closing schools and most nonessential businesses through April 30. Gordon updated his order Friday, along with a directive that says anyone who comes to Wyoming from out-of-state must self-quarantine for 14 days unless the trip is related to a job. Wyoming does not have a mandatory statewide stay-at-home order, although the governor\u2019s office says in a statement, \u201cThe Governor continues to emphatically state that people need to stay home whenever possible to prevent or slow the spread of the virus.\u201d As of Friday afternoon, Wyoming is the only state in the US with no confirmed deaths due to Covid-19.\u00a0However, state Department of Health spokeswoman Kim Deti tells CNN that a cluster of coronavirus at an assisted living facility in Lander is straining the resources of one of the hospitals in Fremont County, where nine patients are in isolation.\u00a0 Fremont County has a population of fewer than 50,000 people, but covers an area of more than 9,000 square miles. CORRECTION: This post has been updated to reflect that Wyoming\u2019s governor has recommended staying at home. Illinois announced 1,209 new cases and an additional 53 deaths Friday in the biggest one day jump in both cases and deaths the state has seen to date. At a Friday news conference, Gov. J.B. Pritzker also urged residents to wear a mask when going outside. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a homemade fabric mask, or maybe it\u2019s a manufactured general mask, really just something to cover your nose and mouth out of courtesy to those around you in case you\u2019re one of those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic,\u201d Pritzker said at his daily briefing.\u00a0 Seventy percent of ICU beds are now occupied in the state of Illinois while only fifty percent of the state\u2019s ventilators are available, according to data from the state health department Friday. \u201cEvery day we have added existing beds and equipment at our existing hospitals to increase capacity,\u201d Pritzker said Friday. \u201cThat availability is diminishing as Covid-19\u2019s presence continues to grow,\u201d Pritzker told reporters.\u00a0 ##Health## Connecticut has 1,090 new coronavirus cases and 19 new deaths, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday. The state now has a total of 4,914 cases and 131 deaths. 909 patients are currently hospitalized. \u201cOur number of positives went up about 29%, which is probably more than we\u2019ve seen in the past and a little disturbingly, the percentage of tests that resulted in people positive spiked up at 64%,\u201d Lamont added. ##Health## Colorado Gov. Jared Polis asked everybody in his state to wear a mask when they leave their homes. \"Now, if you've been around grocery stores, you've noticed that more and more people are wearing cloth masks \u2014 we want everybody in Colorado to do that,\" Polis said during a press conference today. He asked people to use non-medical masks to save resources for health care workers, and tweeted tweeted out a photo of him wearing one of his own.  US stocks closed sharply lower on Friday, following a much worse-than-expected jobs report for March. All three major indexes recorded a loss for the week, making it their third down-week in four. Here's where the markets closed:  The Dow closed 361 points, or 1.7%, lower.\nThe S&P 500 closed down 1.5%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite finished down 1.5%. \u00a0Remember: As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. ##Business## President Trump has approved a disaster declaration for New Hampshire in response to coronavirus.  This is the 36th\u00a0such declaration he has made in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including 31 states, the\u00a0US Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. ##Health## \u00a0 The coronavirus pandemic is starting to noticeably damage economic data around the world. The global composite output index, produced by\u00a0JPMorgan and IHS Markit, slumped to 39.4 points in March, its\u00a0fastest drop in some 11 years. Any level below 50 denotes an economic contraction. Even though the index had been in contraction territory in the prior month as well \u2014 46.1 points in February \u2014 the drop-off was the second-biggest on record, surpassed only by a drop in October 2001. Looking closer at the global services sector, business activity, new business and new export business all dropped at the sharpest rate in survey history. Not all countries were hit the same: China, which was hit by the pandemic earlier in the year, got some respite from its rate of contraction.  The outbreak is still sweeping across the United States, where business activity dropped to the greatest extent since the height of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Still, America saw the weakest downturn among its developed world peers. ##Business## The Transportation Security Administration reported the first coronavirus death in its ranks.\u00a0 The employee was a 39-year-old K9 handler at the Newark airport, the TSA said Friday. More than 130 TSA officers and agency employees have tested positive for coronavirus.\u00a0 There are 10,710 cases in the state, with 237 deaths, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Department of Public Health. There are at least\u00a0261,438\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a06,699\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. So far, on Friday,\u00a015,865\u00a0new cases and\u00a0641\u00a0deaths have been reported, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins.\u00a0 The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all\u00a0repatriated cases. Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at a press conference Friday that the federal government should do more to direct industries to make personal protective equipment (PPE) for those on the front lines treating patients with Covid-19. \u201cI know the President has ordered some companies to ramp up productions of ventilators. This is important, and badly needed. But the federal government can and should do more to direct industries to help produce these supplies,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThis pandemic is a war. And we need the armor to fight it.\u201d North Carolina has received three shipments of PPE from the Strategic National Stockpile but not the amount they have requested, Cooper said. \u201cWe're grateful for these supplies. But to be clear, we've gotten just 33% of what we've asked for and told not to expect more anytime soon,\" Cooper added. Some context: The governor said that North Carolina, like many states in the country, is grappling with shortages of critical medical supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic and trying to find ways to buy more. \u201cNow of course we know that we can't rely solely on the National Stockpile, and our emergency management teams are working around the clock to find the equipment that is so badly needed by those on the front line of this pandemic, we're not the only ones,\u201d Cooper said. ##Health## The US military is preparing to deploy additional forces in support of the coronavirus response, including 15 Army task forces, a US defense official told CNN. The US Navy has placed two additional Navy Expeditionary Medical Treatment Facilities, one active duty and the other drawn from the reserves on \"prepare to deploy orders.\" The Navy earlier sent two of these units to New Orleans and Dallas. They consist of about 450 personnel, 150 of which are doctors.\u00a0 The location of where the units are being sent has yet to be determined and that decision will be made by Federal Emergency Management Agency. The official said the units should be ready to deploy in about 72 hours. While they are expected to go to New York, FEMA will make that decision.\u00a0 The Navy and Air Force are also mobilizing volunteer reservists.\u00a0 The Army has also created from its reserves 15 teams known as \"Urban Area Medical Task Forces\" to help bolster the coronavirus response. These teams will consist of 85 personnel each, 20 of whom will be doctors, for a total of 1,275 personnel. The task forces are intended to serve as an augmentation element, going into retrofitted arenas and convention centers in support of HHS. The official said these forces should be mobilized by Tuesday. There is acknowledgement within the Department of Defense that the situation in New York is deteriorating to the point where the US military has to draw more from its own medical capabilities, assuming risk at defense installations, in order to help combat the pandemic.\u00a0 By the numbers: These additional forces will join the US military's 460 doctors, 1,117 nurses and other medical personnel already assisting civilian communities in their response to the coronavirus.\u00a0 ##Health## The Supreme Court on Friday said that it will postpone the remaining two weeks of arguments that were set to begin on April 20 and that it is considering rescheduling some of the 20 or so cases that it has had to put off so far in response to Covid-19. \u201cThe court will consider rescheduling some cases from the March and April sessions before the end of the Term, if circumstances permit in light of public health and safety guidance at that time,\u201d said court spokesperson Kathy Arberg. \u201cThe court will consider a range of scheduling options and other alternatives if arguments cannot be held in the courtroom before the end of the term.\u201d\u00a0 According to the statement, the justices will release opinions for all the cases that have been argued so far this term. The Pentagon is deploying a\u00a0deploying a mortuary affairs unit to New York City\u00a0to support the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, a US defense official said Friday.  The deployment is at the request of Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUnder our Defense Support to Civil Authorities mission, U.S. Northern Command is facilitating this request on behalf of DoD.\u00a0\u00a0These highly trained specialists will assist New York City with the solemn duty of properly handling human remains during this pandemic. Forty-two Soldiers from the 54th Quartermaster Company, from Fort Lee, Va., have deployed to Joint Base Maguire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J. Federal and local laws regulate how these operations are conducted in the United States,\u201d the official said. Dr. Mandy K. Cohen, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS), announced Friday that 43% of people diagnosed with Covid-19 are ages 25-49. So far, 29% are age 50-64 and 20% are age 65 and up, Cohen said. While Covid-19 has been more deadly and severe for people older than 60 and those with underlying health, health officials and leaders around the country have been imploring younger people to practice social distancing. \u201cWe're entering the first weekend of my order to stay at home. I need you to do just that. I know it's tempting to get away from all this and gather with friends and extended family, especially when Friday means the end of the week. Don't,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Friday. \u201cThis virus is still spreading quickly. No one is immune. There is no vaccination, and social distancing is our best protection\u2026 Lots of Tar Heel blue skies are in our forecast. I know it's hard, but stay at home anyway. We're in a crucial time period for flattening the curve. And we still need you to step up.\u201d By the numbers: NCDHHS reports 2,093 cases of Covid-19 in the state with 19 deaths. This up from 764 cases a week ago, according to Cohen.  There are 259 people in the hospital, the NCDHHS reports. There are currently about 852 people in Pennsylvania hospitalized due to Covid-19 \u2014 about 10% of all cases, state Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said today. Of those hospitalized, 241 have required intensive care, and 147 have needed ventilators, Levine said, adding that 12% of the state's nursing homes had at least one confirmed case. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf asked in a press conference Friday that all Pennsylvanians wear a mask anytime they leave their home for essential needs. \u201cToday I am asking all Pennsylvanians to wear a mask anytime you leave your house. Masks help prevent people from sharing illnesses. They don\u2019t do a great job at keeping people from getting sick, and they\u2019re not foolproof. So it\u2019s critical that our first act, as Secretary Levine said, is to ask ourselves if we really need to leave our house. If we don\u2019t really, truly need to leave, then we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Wolf said. Wolf said that N95 and paper masks should still be reserved for healthcare workers, and that residents should use cloth to cover their nose and mouth, or make their own mask.\u00a0Guidelines for making your own mask can be found on the state\u2019s website, Wolf said.\u00a0 \u201cWearing a mask will help us cut down the possibility that we might be infecting an innocent bystander, like that grocery store cashier, the pharmacist, or someone stocking shelves,\u201d he said. ##Health## A White House official confirmed reports that it\u00a0will give rapid Covid-19 screening tests to anyone who comes in close contact with both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\u00a0 \u201cAs the physician to the President and White House Operations continue to protect the health and safety of the President and Vice President, starting today anyone who is expected to be in close proximity to either of them will be administered a COVID-19 test to evaluate for pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers status to limit inadvertent transmission,\" Deputy White House Press\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Judd Deere said in a statement. The White House has been conducting temperature checks for those close to Trump and Pence since March 14. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo says the state is readying for a surge of coronavirus patients.  Right now, the state plans to set up three field hospitals: one at the Rhode Island Convention Center, one at a former bank and the last at a former Lowe\u2019s warehouse building. \u201cWe believe that those three sites alone will get us well over a thousand additional hospital beds,\u201d Raimondo said. ##Health## While the World Health Organization has not changed its position on whether the general public should wear face masks during the coronavirus pandemic, it will support individual countries in making their own national recommendations around mask wearing. \"We can certainly see circumstances in which the use of masks \u2014 both homemade and cloth masks \u2014 at the community level may help in an overall comprehensive response to this disease, and we will support governments in making those decisions based on the situation they find themselves in in terms of transmission,\"\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Mike\u00a0Ryan,\u00a0WHO\u00a0executive director of health emergencies programme, said during a media briefing in Geneva on Friday. Ryan said that wearing a mask in public doesn't necessarily protect the person wearing it, but rather helps to limit that person's likelihood of infecting others if that person is sick. ##Health## Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan just announced stricter measures to combat the spread of coronavirus.\u00a0 Here's a look at the measures: Masks will be mandatory in supermarkets, bazaars and work places, Erdogan said in a televised address today.\nVehicular traffic is prohibited in and out of 30 major metropolitan areas as well as the province of Zonguldak, where there are high numbers of chronic respiratory illness, Erdogan said. Intercity travel is already restricted by plane and bus in Turkey. The new measure applies to private vehicles.\u00a0\nThe new measures also extend the scope of aged-based mandatory lockdown to people under the age of 20, Erdogan said. Turkey previously instituted a forced quarantine for people over the age of 65 and for people with chronic illnesses.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## New Jersey looks to be a week behind New York state on the Covid-19 curve, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci told New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. \u201cHe looks at us as part of the New York metro area, it looked to him like we are a weekish behind New York,\" Murphy said in a press conference. ##Health## There are at least\u00a0258,214\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States.  There are 6,605\u00a0people who have died in the US from coronavirus.\u00a0 So far, on Friday,\u00a012,641\u00a0new cases and\u00a0547\u00a0deaths have been reported, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins.\u00a0 The total includes cases from all 50 states, Washington, DC, and other US territories, as well as all\u00a0repatriated cases. Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite,\u00a0commander of the Army Corps of Engineers said to date, they have received 750 requests for site assessments across the country to look into possible facilities that could be used in the coronavirus response.\u00a0 Semonite said the Corps has completed 673 of those site assessments. He said to date the Army Corps of Engineers are \u201cnot resource strained\u201d in terms of being able to carry out site assessments as they continue their work running and setting up treatment sites across the United States. \u00a0 In partnership with the mayor\u2019s office, United Airlines will announce a program to provide free round-trip flights for medical volunteers from across the country who want to help in frontline fight against the Covid-19 crisis in New York City, according to United Airlines spokeswoman Karen Twigg May.\u00a0 May says that United is working with government agencies in other hotspots to expand the service to other places. In addition, May said there\u2019s no cap on the number of free flights United will offer to volunteers. \u201cWe will fly as many volunteers as our operation can support on any route we offer to NY,\u201d  May said.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Travel## The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday changed its position on a sought-after type of respirator from China, the KN95, announcing that the agency will authorize the mask for use in healthcare settings if it meets certain criteria. In response to continued respirator shortages, the FDA issued new guidance, authorizing KN95 respirators if certain criteria are met, including evidence demonstrating that the respirator is authentic. The move comes after conflicting government guidance caused confusion over how these masks should be used and whether they could be imported into the US. The FDA did not include these masks on its initial guidance for emergency use issued last month, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the KN95 masks are \u201cexpected to be suitable alternatives\u201d to the N95 masks during the coronavirus pandemic when supplies are short.\u00a0 The differing guidance left suppliers hesitant to ship masks and US buyers wary of purchasing them.\u00a0 On March 28th, the FDA listed masks from six countries, including Mexico and Brazil, that it found \u201cappropriate to protect public health or safety,\u201d but left the Chinese masks off the list. ##Health## The state of New Jersey has 4,372 new positive cases of Covid-19, Gov. Phil Murphy announced in a press conference.\u00a0 To date, 29,895 people across the state have tested positive for Covid-19, Murphy said.\u00a0\u00a0 A total of 646 people have died as a result of Covid-19 in New Jersey. That number includes 113 additional deaths confirmed in the last 24 hours, the governor announced.\u00a0\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that Democrats could put on hold a host of their infrastructure priorities and instead advance a new stimulus measure that mirrors the historic $2.2 trillion stimulus package President Trump signed into law last week. \u201cThe acceleration of the coronavirus demands that we double down on the downpayment we made in CARES by passing a CARES 2 package.\u00a0We must extend and expand this bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of the American people,\" she said in a statement on Friday. She added: \u201cIt is imperative that we go bigger and further assisting small business, to go longer in unemployment benefits and provide additional resources to process UI claims and to give families additional direct payments.\u00a0We must also provide the desperately needed resources for our hospitals, community health centers, health systems and health workers on the frontlines of this crisis.\u00a0We cannot succeed in defeating this virus unless we more strongly support state and local governments with significantly more resources.\u201d Earlier on Friday: Pelosi indicated the Democrats\u2019 infrastructure priorities, which they have advocated for as part of another legislative response to the pandemic, could be pushed off for a later bill. There are at least\u00a0257,773\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the country. There are 6,586\u00a0people who have died in the US from coronavirus.\u00a0 So far, on Friday,\u00a012,200\u00a0new cases and\u00a0528\u00a0deaths have been reported, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins.\u00a0 The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases. Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. Heathrow Airport will \u201ctransition to single runway operations\u201d due to the \u201cunprecedented impact that the coronavirus outbreak is having on Heathrow\u2019s operation.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Heathrow said that single runway operations will commence on April 6. The airport will alternate which runway is used on a weekly basis: 27R or 09L.\u00a0 The statement continued to say that Heathrow will remain open so that it can \u201cplay a crucial role in helping to secure vital medical goods and food for the nation during the unprecedented epidemic.\" The change is the latest change at all major London airports due to the coronavirus outbreak. London City airport closed last month to all commercial and private flights. London Gatwick airport also closed the North Terminal. ##Travel## Half of the hospitals inside Beaumont Health system, which describes itself as Michigan\u2019s largest, are at capacity due to the increasing Covid-19 cases and it faces a crunch that includes its staffing, finances and supplies, CEO John T. Fox told CNN. The eight hospital\u00a0system\u00a0located in the southeast region of the state is currently treating\u00a0nearly 950\u00a0hospitalized,\u00a0confirmed cases and an additional 91 who are suspected of having the virus as of 3 p.m. Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cOur biggest rate limiter is staffing,\u201d Fox said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThe politicians are getting on the podium and saying, \u2018we're building a 900-bed field hospital over here, 500-bed one over there.\u2019 But those are empty buildings of no value without the staff. They often don't have pharmacies, they don't have labs, they don't have a lot of things and so it becomes a fiction.\u201d Fox also called on the state of Michigan to do more in terms of load balancing patients between hospitals in the state, as Beaumont has found it difficult to do on their own. Fox says price gouging among agency nurses factors into the inability to acquire more staff and sucks available funds from the system. Agency nurses are\u00a0contracted\u00a0by hospitals at a price to help supplement staff nurses temporarily. Twenty\u00a0days ago, agencies would charge $60 an hour for a nurses with everything included. That price has more than doubled,\u00a0with the agencies bidding hospitals against one another to secure a nurse for $130, sometimes $150 an hour, Fox said. ##Health## \u00a0 Britain\u2019s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van Tam says it is still \u201ctoo soon to say\u201d when the UK will reach the peak of the epidemic. Earlier on Friday,\u00a0UK Health Secretary Matt\u00a0Hancock\u00a0had said the deadliest peak of the coronavirus outbreak in Britain could hit on Easter Sunday.\u00a0\u201cI defer to the scientists on the predictions,\u201d he told Sky News. During the daily briefing on Friday, Hancock seemed to revise his statement saying \u201cthe truth is we don\u2019t know.\" ##Health## There are at least 12 new coronavirus-related deaths in Pennsylvania, which brings the total to 102, according to the commonwealth\u2019s Department of Health. There are an additional 1,404 positive cases reported, according to a press release issued Friday. The total number of coronavirus cases is now 8,420 in the state. \u201cThe continued rise in cases combined with our increasing deaths from Covid-19 reflects the seriousness of this situation,\u201d Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said. \u201cWe need everyone to listen to the orders in place and to stay calm, stay home and stay safe. We know that these prolonged mitigation effects have been difficult for everyone, but it is essential that everyone follows these orders and does not go out unless they absolutely must.\u201d ##Health## The British Health Secretary Matt Hancock and health officials in the United Kingdom have called on Britons to continue to stay at home despite an expected rise in temperatures across the country over the weekend.\u00a0 \u201cWe absolutely cannot afford to relax social distancing measures,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do people will die.\u201d Hancock went on to say the UK had boosted \u201cthe number of critical care beds to care for coronavirus by over 2,500,\u201d without taking into account the additional beds that will be available at several repurposed conference centers across the country, known as NHS Nightingale. ##Daily Life## New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker says \u201cthere\u2019s no data to support the use of face masks\u201d in protecting the public in the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cRight now, there isn't data\u2026except\u00a0for those who are ill and those\u00a0who are health care workers, and\u00a0that's why we're reserving those\u00a0for health care workers,\u201d Zucker said.\u00a0 He added that they continue to look at data all the time and are examining it on a rolling basis.\u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that he doesn\u2019t want the public to ease up on practicing social distancing if they wear face coverings.\u00a0 \u201cI think it's fair to say the\u00a0masks couldn't hurt, unless they\u00a0gave you a false sense of\u00a0security,\u201d he said.\u00a0\"...Might it help?\u00a0I think it's fair to say yes, but don't get a false sense of\u00a0security that now you don't have\u00a0to social distance and you don't\u00a0have to take the normal\u00a0precautions because you're\u00a0wearing a bandana,\u201d Cuomo said.\u00a0 Zucker agreed with the governor\u2019s assessment. Michael A. Lanotte, the executive director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, said deaths have increased dramatically in New York City. \u201cSince yesterday afternoon I have heard from more and more funeral directors in the city that have reached the capacity to help families,\u201d Lanotte told CNN Friday. \u201cThe biggest enemy is time,\u201d Lanotte said, \u201cYou take the volume and the amount of time we have from death to final disposition, there is just not enough time in the day based on the volume. 2+2 does not equal 4 in this situation.\u201d Lanotte said, \u201cthere is a lot of death happening in the hospitals, nursing homes, and in private homes.\u201d Refrigeration is a big problem, Lanotte said, \u201cIn some cases there are funeral homes which have run out of storage, limiting their ability to help additional families.\u201d \u201cThe volume is working against the process because the process takes time, we need extra storage,\" he said. Efforts are being made to increase mobile morgues, Lanotte said. \u00a0 In an effort to combat the shortage of medical supplies to treat Covid-19 patients in the state, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he is signing an executive order allowing the state to take ventilators and personal protective equipment from institutions that are not currently using them and \"redeploy them to\u00a0other parts of the state and\u00a0other hospitals that do need\u00a0them.\" Cuomo said that unused equipment will later be returned and those entities will be reimbursed. \"Those institutions will either\u00a0get their ventilator back or\u00a0they will be reimbursed and paid\u00a0for their ventilator so they can\u00a0buy a new ventilator.\u00a0I can't do anything more than\u00a0that.\u00a0But I'm not going to be in a\u00a0position where people are dying\u00a0and we have several hundred\u00a0ventilators in our own state\u00a0somewhere else.\"\u00a0 Cuomo added: \"If you don't get the ventilator\u00a0back, I give you my personal\u00a0word, I will pay you for the\u00a0ventilator.\"\u00a0 Watch: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said there are now 102,863 coronavirus cases in the state. More than 14,000 patients are currently hospitalized. So far, 2,935 people have died in the state \u2014 that's up from 2,373, Cuomo said. \"Highest single increase in the number of deaths since we started,\" Cuomo said. ##Health##  English Premier League teams have agreed to discuss the possibility of their players taking 30% pay cuts and suspend the 2019-2020 football season indefinitely.  All 20 clubs in England\u2019s top-flight league and key stakeholders held a videoconference meeting today. The proposed 30% wage cuts of \u201ctotal annual renumeration\u201d would be brought about through \u201ca combination of conditional reductions and deferrals,\u201d the league said in a statement. The proposal will be further discussed by the Premier League, players and club representatives and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, which is the trade union which represents professional footballers in England and Wales, at a meeting tomorrow. The League also agreed to immediately donate \u00a320 million to the NHS to help support communities, families and vulnerable groups in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It was also announced that the 2019-20 season would not resume at the beginning of May as originally intended but \u201conly when it is safe and appropriate to do so\u201d adding that \u201cany return to play will only be with the full support of Government and when medical guidance allows.\u201d ##Daily Life##\u00a0 Delta is giving passengers two years to use credit from canceled flights, the company said in a statement today. Travelers who cancel flights on Delta now have through May 2022 to use their credits.\u00a0 This move is the latest sign that the airlines expect this decline in travel interest, and the corresponding economic downturn, to linger.\u00a0 The company said in a statement: \"Amid the ongoing challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, Delta is committing the utmost care and attention to evaluating our travel waiver policies and continuing to make it even easier for customers to cancel, change or rebook travel.\nWhether customers have been affected by recent schedule adjustments or want additional reassurance about upcoming travel, we\u2019re now extending the ability to plan, re-book and travel with us for up to two years \u2013 giving Delta customers some extra breathing room.\" ##Business##\u00a0 There are at least\u00a0245,646\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and 6,068\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases.

Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. ##Health## The US military will convert three temporary medical facilities in New York, New Orleans, and Dallas into facilities capable of treating patients with the coronavirus, the Pentagon announced Friday. \u201cAt the request of FEMA, the Department of Defense will expand its medical support to include Covid-19 positive patients at the Javits Federal Medical Station (FMS) in New York City, the Morial FMS in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Kay Bailey Hutchinson FMS in Dallas, Texas,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThese three DoD-supported locations will now provide support to Covid-19 positive patients in convalescent care, as well as low-acuity patients. These patients, who require a lower level of medical care, must first be screened at a local hospital,\u201d the statement added. What's this about: Originally all three facilities were intended to treat non-coronavirus patients in order to free up capacity at civilian hospitals. On Thursday President Trump confirmed the Javits Center would be converted into a facility capable of treating coronavirus patients, a move that has been requested by New York\u2019s governor. ##Health## Jim Baumbick, Ford Vice President of Enterprise Product Line Management, said the company would not be giving its ventilators to the highest bidder, but instead rely on the expertise of partner GE Healthcare and the Trump administration to decide where to send them.  \u201cThey are very well experienced in the distribution of this critical ventilator equipment. And we're going to leverage all of their expertise to get it where it needs to go and, certainly, we're coordinating with the administration and other really critical sources through GE Healthcare's expertise,\u201d Baumbick told CNN\u2019s Julia Chatterley.\u00a0 Some context: Ford and GE Healthcare are planning in partnership to produce 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days. ##Business## ##Health## Germany's largest football stadium \u2014 the Westfalen stadium \u2014 will be a coronavirus treatment center starting tomorrow, the Borussia Dortmund football team confirmed in a statement. \u201cStarting tomorrow, Saturday, the focus in the area of the north stand of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK will not be on football, but on the treatment of suspected cases of coronavirus and patients with corresponding symptoms,\u201d the statement said. Dortmund managing directors Hans-Joachim Watzke and Carsten Cramer said the facility is an \"ideal place to actively help people.\" \u201cOur stadium is the figurehead of the city, a fixed point for almost everyone in Dortmund and the surrounding area and, thanks to its technical, infrastructural and spatial conditions, is the ideal place to actively help people who are potentially infected by the coronavirus or who complain about corresponding symptoms such as respiratory diseases and fever,\" they said in the statement. They said it is \u201cour duty and our desire\u201d to do everything possible to help.

The Mexican beer company said it was taking the steps to \u201ccomply with the measures adopted by the Federal Government\u201d of Mexico.\u00a0 They also expressed their \u201ctotal commitment to be part of the fight against the SARS-Cov2 virus\u201d, the statement reads. ##Business##\u00a0 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the Covid-19 pandemic in the US is going to \"get worse, much worse, before it gets better,\" but that social distancing is working to mitigate the spread of the virus. \"There's no doubt in my mind or anyone who knows anything about this, that the mitigation activities, the physical separation that we're doing clearly is having a positive impact,\" he said this morning on on \"Fox & Friends.\"  \"You don't see it dramatically yet, because there's the dynamic, with the virus doing what the virus wants to do, and we're trying to suppress it with mitigation,\" he added. Fauci urged the country to continue to follow social distancing recommendations.  \"That is the answer and quite frankly that is the only tool that we really have that we know is effective,\" Fauci explained.\u00a0 ##Health## 3M, which manufacturers much-needed N95 respirator masks, said in a statement Friday its employees have \u201cgone above and beyond\u201d to manufacture \u201cas many N95 respirators as possible for the U.S. market.\u201d The statement was released after the Trump administration formally invoked the Defense Production Act, requiring 3M to prioritize orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its N95 respirators. 3M said it has been working closely with the administration and will continue do so, adding that it appreciates the authorities in the DPA because it provides a framework to expand their work while responding to the pandemic. The statement noted that the administration also requested that 3M stop exporting respirators that are manufactured in the United States to the Canadian and Latin American markets, which has\u00a0\u201csignificant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators.\u201d \u201cIn addition, ceasing all export of respirators produced in the United States would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same, as some have already done,\u201d the company said. \u201cIf that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease. That is the opposite of what we and the Administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek.\u201d Even though some early data out of Wuhan, China, suggests that the\u00a0malaria\u00a0drug\u00a0hydroxychloroquine\u00a0could \u201csignificantly\u201d shorten the time it takes for Covid-19 patients to recover from illness, US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that more research is needed to determine that drug's effectiveness against Covid-19. That early data is not \"very robust,\" Fauci said on \"Fox & Friends.\"  \"Granted that there is a suggestion that there is a benefit there, I think we've got to be careful that we don't make that majestic leap to assume that this is a knockout drug,\" Fauci said this morning. \"We still need to do the kinds of studies that definitively prove whether any intervention \u2014 not just this one \u2014 any intervention is truly safe and effective,\" Fauci said. \"But when you don't have that information it's understandable, and I grant that, it's understandable why people may want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of it being effective and I have no problem with that.\" ##Health## The US Navy Hospital Ship Comfort is \u201cactively working to refine the process,\u201d as the ships takes on more patients,\u00a0a Navy official on the ship tells CNN.\u00a0 As of Thursday night, there was only about 20 non-Covid-19 patients on board.\u00a0 The Navy official said: \u201cWe are conducting data analysis to see how we need to change our configuration\u2014 bottom line we\u2019ve been here 48 hours, and this is a scenario no one has ever seen before... no one wants to get this wrong.

CNN's Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report The Queen has recorded a televised address in relation to the coronavirus outbreak, Buckingham Palace says. It will be broadcast this Sunday.\u00a0 Here's the statement from the palace: \u201cHer Majesty The Queen has recorded a special broadcast to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth in relation to the Coronavirus outbreak. The televised address will be broadcast at 8pm (3pET) on Sunday 5th April, 2020.\u00a0The address was recorded at Windsor Castle.\u201d The American economy lost more jobs than it gained for the first time in a decade. In March, the economy shed 701,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It was the first time the economy lost jobs in a month since September 2010. Last month was the worst for American jobs since March 2009. The unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%, from a near 50-year low of 3.5%. It was the highest unemployment rate since August 2017. The labor market survey concludes in the middle of the month, so the March report didn't count the worst of the coronavirus effects on the economy, including many of the stay-at-home orders around the country.\u00a0 In the second half of last month, nearly 10 million Americans filed for first time unemployment benefits as the outbreak forced businesses to close and people to stay home. This development will be reflected in the April jobs report, which is due on May 8. The Congressional Budget Office expects the unemployment rate to climb past 10% in the second quarter, it said Thursday. ##Business##  Should you or shouldn't you wear a face mask during the coronavirus pandemic? Here's what health organizations and top experts say.  The\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The organization recommends\u00a0that if you are not sick, \"you do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick.\" However, if you are sick, \"You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider\u2019s office,\" the CDC said. The World Health Organization: WHO\u00a0is standing by its recommendation\u00a0to only wear a mask if you are sick or caring for someone who is sick. \"Mask wearing by the general public is not among the WHO\u2019s recommendations,\" the organization said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy: Moments ago, he said masks should not be used as a substitute for social distancing, but rather can be used as a supplement. \"Because of some recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak as opposed to coughing and sneezing, the better part of valor is that when you're out and you can't maintain that six-foot distance to wear some sort of facial covering.\" has said that the\u00a0White House Task Force is actively discussing guidelines on masks.  CNN's Sanjay Gupta: He explained that masks could help people who have coronavirus but not have symptoms from spreading the virus. \"The way to think about this mask issue is that it's not really, still, for people who are not infected. This is more for people who might be infected and don't know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else.\" He stressed that social distancing is the best best way to fight the spread of coronavirus, and said that N95 respirators should be reserved for health care workers. As US officials continue to re-examine whether the general public should wear masks, the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci,\u00a0emphasized that masks should not be viewed as a substitute for continuing to practice social distancing. \"The most important thing is to keep this six-foot physical distance from individuals, but it's become clear that even when you try to do that with certain necessities of life \u2014 going out to get food or going to a pharmacy to get your medications \u2014 that you may inadvertently come into closer contact,\"\u00a0Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on \"Fox & Friends\" Friday morning. He added: \"Because of that and because of some recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak as opposed to coughing and sneezing, the better part of valor is that when you're out and you can't maintain that six-foot distance to wear some sort of facial covering ... So this is an addendum and an addition to the physical separation, not as a substitute for it.\"  \u00a0##Health## Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 response, said people who are sick and their caretakers should wear face masks \u2014 but stressed that N95 masks need to be reserved for health care workers. \"What we recommend is that people who are sick wear masks \u2014 medical masks, not N95 masks with respirators. Those must be reserved for our frontline workers who are caring for patients,\" she said at a CNN town hall on coronavirus last night. \"We also need people who are caring for those who are sick to be wearing the masks,\" she added. She said right now, it's crucial that personal protective equipment in short supply be reserved for medical workers. \"We have to prioritize the use\u00a0of masks for frontline workers,\u00a0if that is one thing I can\u00a0stress.\u00a0Medical masks, respirators,\u00a0gloves, gowns, these are people\u00a0who are putting their lives on\u00a0the line to help us, to care\u00a0for other people and they must\u00a0be protected,\" she said. Some background: The WHO has been one of the strongest holdouts when it comes to recommending the widespread use of masks. US health officials recommended the same \u2014 but they may be shifting course. On Monday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert\u00a0Redfield,\u00a0told NPR that his organization was reviewing its guidelines and\u00a0may recommend general mask use\u00a0to guard against community infection. Trump said the US plans to release new recommendations on face masks in the coming days. When asked about President Trump's suggestion that people use\u00a0facial coverings like scarves, Van Kerkhove said the WHO is investigating. \"We are constantly looking at\u00a0evidence, all the time, for the\u00a0use of masks for anything that\u00a0is related to this and related\u00a0to health issues.\u00a0We are talking with scientists\u00a0around the world, including US\u00a0CDC scientists,\" she said. At least 1,052 US service members have tested positive for Covid-19 as of this number. This includes one death announced earlier this week.\u00a0 There are now at least 1,752 positive cases across the Department of Defense. ##Health## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says this Sunday is \u201cD-Day\u201d \u2014 the day when the city will run out of ventilators and health care workers will really feel the strain of the battle against coronavirus. \u201cWe predict by something like\u00a0Monday or Tuesday, 5,000 people\u00a0in our ICUs intubated fighting\u00a0for their lives with Covid\u00a0cases.\u00a05,000.\u00a0Then that number will grow.\u00a0That's a staggering number.\u00a0Every one of those people will\u00a0need a ventilator,\u201d de Blasio said to CNN\u2019s John Berman.\u00a0 De Blasio said he asked the federal government over a week ago for more doctors and health care workers, but hasn\u2019t seen any action yet.\u00a0He called for the the military to mobilize doctors and nurses to come to New York City to ease the strain on the city\u2019s medical personnel.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I've said to every one of\u00a0our national leaders is we need\u00a0to get on a wartime footing,\u201d de Blasio tells CNN\u2019s John Berman. \u201cRight now, essentially the\u00a0country is still on a peacetime\u00a0footing.\u00a0But we're fighting a war against an\u00a0invisible enemy that's\u00a0increasingly taking the lives of\u00a0Americans in vast numbers.\u00a0This is just the beginning.\u00a0  \"Next week is going to be much\u00a0tougher,\" he added. De Blasio also urged New Yorkers to wear face coverings when they go outside and are near other people. He says coverings are not necessary if practicing social distancing. Watch more: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will stay in self-isolation because he is still showing symptoms of Covid-19. Friday was expected to be Johnson's final day in self-quarantine, after he tested positive for the virus last week. But Johnson said he still has a temperature and will remain isolated, as per the country's guidelines. The UK has told people with symptoms or who test positive for Covid-19 to stay in self-isolation for seven days, or longer if they are still symptomatic. The World Health Organization's guidelines, by contrast, state people must stay in self-isolation for 14 days after they develop symptoms. Johnson has been leading his country's coronavirus response from home while in quarantine. His Health Secretary Matt Hancock also tested positive last week, but he has now come out of self-isolation. In a video posted to Twitter, Johnson also urged people not to go outside as good weather arrives in the UK over the coming days. \"Everybody may be getting a bit stir-crazy,\" he said. \"Please, stick with the guidance,\" he said. China has advised foreign embassies to stop sending diplomats to Beijing for work or rotation, amid growing concerns over imported coronavirus cases and continuously tightening regulations targeting international arrivals. A foreign ministry official said Friday the move was purely in response to global developments of the pandemic, as well as out of concern for the health and safety of foreign diplomats. She said it is also in line with advice from the World Health Organization and other experts. \u201cThe virus is an equalizer \u2013 while diplomats enjoy immunity, they are not immune from the virus,\u201d said Hua Chunying, a ministry spokeswoman, at a regular press briefing. Hua said there had been confirmed cases among foreign diplomats who recently arrived in China. She added that, of the 84 foreign diplomats who arrived in China in the past week, 66% of them had become close contacts of confirmed cases. She emphasized that all of China\u2019s containment measures treat Chinese and foreign citizens equally and fairly. China has already drastically cut the number of international flights and diverted all Beijing-bound international flights to other Chinese cities. Last weekend, the country shut its borders to most foreigners \u2013 although diplomats have been exempted. Prince Charles has officially opened the UK\u2019s huge temporary hospital for coronavirus patients, describing its rapid construction as a \u201cspectacular and almost unbelievable feat.\u201d London's ExCeL conference center has been transformed into a massive health care facility, named the Nightingale Hospital, in under two weeks.  \u201c(It\u2019s) an example \u2013 if ever one was needed \u2013 of how the impossible could be made possible,\u201d Charles, the heir to the British throne, said via video-link from Scotland. The hospital will initially provide up to 500 beds equipped with ventilators and oxygen, though thousands more will soon be ready. \u201cIn this dark time, this place will be a shining light,\u201d Prince Charles said. \u201cIt is symbolic of the selfless care and devoted service taking place in innumerable settings, with countless individuals throughout the United Kingdom.\u201d Prince Charles says the hospital offers an \u201cintensively practical message of hope\u201d to those who need it most. The prince has been self-isolating in Scotland after being diagnosed with the coronavirus last month. \u201cI was one of the lucky ones to have Covid-19 relatively mildly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for some, it will be a much harder journey. I am therefore so relieved that everyone can now have the reassurance that they will receive all the necessary technical care they may need and every chance to return to a normal life.\u201d \u00a0 Boris Johnson also thanked those involved in building the new hospital on Friday, calling it an \"immense effort.\" Authorities in\u00a0Austria\u00a0say they will carry out randomized coronavirus testing to get a better idea of its spread in the country.\u00a0 Until now, only those who are seriously ill with symptoms have been tested. But the government has decided to change its approach. \u201cBy means of representative random sample tests, the government wants to gain a better overview of the infection of the entire population. To this end, 2,000 tests are to be carried out,\u201d Austria\u2019s federal ministry for social affairs, health, care and consumer protection said in a statement to CNN. The statement added:\u00a0\u201cIn addition, focus tests have been and are being carried out on specific groups, such as medical staff, nurses or supermarket employees. These are PCR tests and the samples are selected to be representative.\u201d Currently, the number of confirmed cases in\u00a0Austria\u00a0stands at 11,171. The death toll is 158. A further 932 people have died from coronavirus in Spain, the country's health ministry said on Friday, bringing the country's death toll closer to Italy's world-high total. Friday's figures mean that 10,935 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Spain. It is the second-highest daily number since the pandemic began in Spain, but slightly smaller than the increase announced Thursday. For several days, however, Spanish health officials have spoken optimistically of reaching the peak of infection. The Ministry\u2019s data shows there are now 76,262 active cases in Spain, an increase of 2,770 from Thursday \u2013 but also the smallest daily rise since March 20. The Spanish Health Ministry also reports that 30,513 have now recovered from the virus \u2013 nearly 4,000 more than the number reported Thursday. A total of 6,416 people have been admitted to intensive care units since the pandemic began, but the rate of new infections has slowed dramatically compared to the dire situation the country was facing in the middle of March. Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel has ended her self-quarantine and returned to work at the chancellery, her spokesman Steffen Seibert says. Merkel went into quarantine two weeks ago after she came into contact with a doctor who later tested positive to coronavirus. Her third test for the virus came back negative, a government spokesperson told CNN on Monday, after two previous tests that were also negative. Meanwhile, the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to come out of self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 last week.  A man who worked for the UK's\u00a0National Health Service\u00a0(NHS) for 20 years was \"neglected\" by his employer after he contracted Covid-19 and died, alleges his daughter Tamira Harvey. Although Thomas Harvey never got a test for\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0before he died, an NHS Trust confirmed to CNN that he had picked up the virus. According to his daughter, the 57-year-old health care assistant was let down by both the hospital where he helped care for recovering stroke patients, and by emergency responders. Tamira alleges that London's Goodmayes Hospital failed to provide necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) to her father. And just a few days before Harvey's death, emergency services \"refused\" to come to take him to hospital, Tamira says, despite family concerns that he wasn't \"breathing properly.\" \"I think he was neglected from the start. It's just a tragedy... It's a mixture of emotions. Loads of questions of why and how this happened. The fact he wasn't tested, none of us were tested. My mother is overwhelmed as they have been together for so long and she has lost her best friend,\" she told CNN. The NHS trust responsible for the hospital where Thomas Harvey worked told CNN on Wednesday that there were no symptomatic patients when he went off work sick. CNN reached out to NHS England via phone and email and has yet to receive a response. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) said they were \"seeing unprecedented demand\" for both their 999 and 111 services at this time. But Tamira remains adamant that the blame for her father's death should ultimately lie in the hands of the UK government. Boris Johnson's government has been criticized in recent days for the small number of NHS workers who have received tests for Covid-19.  Read more here. Germany may not have enough hospital beds and ventilators to tackle its coronavirus outbreak, the head of the country's disease control agency warned on Friday. ''I am very happy that the ventilation beds and intensive care capacities have been increased,\" Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute, told reporters. \"Still,\u00a0I cannot be sure that these capacities are sufficient enough. \"Personally, I have the opinion that they will not be enough and I am happy if I am wrong,\" Wieler added. \"The more ventilators and intensive care beds we have, the more lives we will be able to save and therefore I ask that we continue to ask that we increase the capacities as much as possible.''  Wieler went on to say that he believes ''more people will die of Covid-19 than reported.\" Germany's mortality has rate increased to 1.2%, and Wieler warned against the assumption that the virus only affects older people -- pointing out that Germany's youngest confirmed death was a 28-year-old woman with a pre-existing condition. Germany sent 50 ventilators to Spain to help that country battle its coronavirus outbreak, the German health minister said on Friday. \"Especially in times of coronavirus we stick together. We wish the Spanish much strength in these times,\" Jens Spahn said. Spain has been battling one of the worst outbreaks of Covid-19 anywhere in the world, passing 10,000 virus-related deaths on Thursday. Only Italy has recorded more fatalities, and only Italy and the United States have had more confirmed cases, according to John Hopkins University. Meanwhile, a poll has shown that the vast majority of Germans approve of Angela Merkel's response to the outbreak. About 72% of Germans support the government\u2019s approach, according to the poll by Infratest Dimap. It also shows 93% of respondents approve of the drastic social distancing measures introduced to try to contain the spread of the virus. Germany has implemented a \"contact ban,\" rather than a full nationwide lockdown. It has seen more than 84,000 confirmed cases, but its reported fatalities -- just over 1,100 -- have been lower than other major European countries. ##Health## The fortress town of Zahara de la Sierra in southern Spain is used to fending off enemies. The Moors and Christians fought over it in medieval times, and it was sacked by the French in 1812. Now its formidable position high above the Andalusian countryside has suddenly become an invaluable asset once more. On March 14, Zahara cut itself off from the outside world as the coronavirus\u00a0spread its tentacles across\u00a0Spain. The mayor, 40-year-old Santiago Galv\u00e1n, decided to block all but one of the town's five entrances. Galv\u00e1n acted the day that Spain's \"state of alarm\" came into force. In Zahara, however, there has not been a single recorded case of Covid-19 among its 1,400 inhabitants. \"It has been more than two weeks, and I think that's a good sign,\" Galv\u00e1n told CNN. The mayor's drastic steps have the full support of the townspeople, and especially the elderly. Nearly a quarter of Zahara's inhabitants are older than 65; there are more than 30 residents in an old people's home. Towns and villages nearby have seen infections and several coronavirus fatalities. Read more about the town here. A mob in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh pelted frontline healthcare workers with stones as they tried to treat a patient who was suspected of contracting the novel coronavirus, a police official said.  Doctors in India fighting the virus have been subject to danger and discrimination, as some in the public fear health-care workers could themselves bring the virus into their communities and contribute to its spread.  The incident took place Wednesday, when two doctors and three community health workers were attacked in the city of Indore. \"It was around 2:30 pm and we were counseling a patient when around 200 people came and started pelting stones. It was lucky that a district administrator was with us that day and rushed us out in a car,\" said Dr. Trupti Katdare, one of the doctors there. Katdare said the team only sustained minor leg injuries. The team eventually returned to the same area Thursday to continue screening for coronavirus.  Arrests made: Four people have been arrested, local police said. Harinarayanchari Mishra, the deputy inspector general of Indore police said at a news conference Thursday that authorities are taking the incident \"very seriously\" and plan to make more arrests. \"The remaining are being identified through video footage, we will take action against them,\" he said. The accused have been booked for assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of duty and obstructing a public servant in discharge of functions, Mishra said.\u00a0 A growing problem: Government officials and allies of medical workers have called upon citizens to stop attacking the very people who have dedicated their lives to saving others. \"Attacks on doctors and paramedical staff who are risking their lives who have come to save people will not be tolerated. Strict action will be taken under the National Security Act,\" Shivraj Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, said at a briefing on Thursday.\u00a0 Medical staff in New Delhi say they have been ostracized and discriminated against by their communities due to fears that they may be infected after working with coronavirus patients. Some doctors have even reported being evicted, or faced threats that their electricity will be cut off. \"These doctors are saving our lives, putting their lives at risk,\"\u00a0tweeted Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi. \"Their landlords should not do this. This is wrong.\" ##Health## ##Daily Life## The top US general in South Korea says that he does not believe North Korea\u2019s claim it has no cases of novel coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cThat is an impossible claim based on all of the intel we have seen,\u201d Gen. Robert Abrams, Commander of US Forces Korea (USFK), said in a joint interview with CNN and Voice of America. \u201cHow many? I couldn\u2019t tell you but I do know by their actions that for about 30 days in February, early March, that their military was locked down and they took draconian methods on their border crossings and in their formations.\u201d North Korea has not reported any coronavirus infections, but it borders two of the most heavily affected countries in the region -- China and South Korea. While the 16th USFK-related coronavirus infection was reported yesterday, Abrams said the military force has managed to keep that number low. \u201cWe've seen the worst but now is not the time to get complacent. Our worst is frankly not that bad,\" Abrams said. Watch:  Libya\u2019s National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) said in a statement Thursday that the country has reported its first Covid-19 related fatality. \u00a0 The patient was an 85-year-old woman, who tested positive for the virus after her death. The United Nations has called on the warring parties in Libya's civil conflict to cease hostilities in order to focus on stopping the virus' spread. The\u00a0UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in Libya said the country needs about $12.5 million to help pay for isolation units, personal protective equipment, lab reagent detection kits and training for healthcare workers. \"We are extremely saddened to learn about Libya's first death\u00a0due to COVID-19, as declared by the National Center of Disease Control,\" UNOCHA said in a tweet. \"The UN, alongside health authorities and partners, are working tirelessly to contain\u00a0the virus and advocate for peace during these tragic times.\" ##Health## British health minister Matt Hancock said he believes that those who have recovered  should continue practicing social distancing rules, as more research is needed to understand how immunity works with this particular strain of coronavirus. Hancock and Prime Minister Boris Johnson both tested positive for the virus last month.  \u201cThe advice is it\u2019s highly likely that I\u2019m now immune or have a very high level of immunity, but it\u2019s not certain,\u201d Hancock told BBC Radio on Friday. \u201cAnd so I -- like everybody else who\u2019s been through it -- am social distancing.\u201d Hancock said the issue of immunity -- and therefore the antibody test --\u00a0will become increasingly important as the UK government looks to wind back the restrictions it has put in place to curb the pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cIn a typical coronavirus -- one of the six existing coronaviruses -- immunity lasts a minimum of a year. And for some diseases can last up to a lifetime,\" he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that yet because this disease is only four months old.\u201d ##Health## ##Daily Life## Like many Americans across the country, Wenqiong Xue has been fanatically making face masks for two weeks, using ripped bedsheets and a sewing machine that she dusted off from a closet in her Boston area house. But the homemaker in Medfield, Massachusetts, is more than just a mask maker -- she has become a mask advocate, long before President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force is expected to recommend that Americans begin wearing face coverings in public. A Beijing native who has lived in the US since 1985, Xue said many Chinese Americans like her realized early on the importance of wearing masks in stopping the spread of the deadly virus, thanks to a steady stream of news reports and expert opinions from China, the original epicenter of the global pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cWe all read so much about what was happening in Wuhan on WeChat,\u201d she said, referring to the popular social media platform that has become a major information source for the Chinese diaspora. \u201cWe knew how serious the outbreak was and started being careful much earlier than other Americans.\u201d Xue and other members of a local WeChat group sewed more than 1,300 masks within a week, delivering them to several local hospitals. But even when the medical institutions advised them not to send in any more handmade masks, Xue didn\u2019t stop -- shifting her focus to the general public. Trying to convince most Americans about the usefulness of wearing masks hasn\u2019t been easy, though, due to long-held cultural beliefs. Xue said even her adult children, born and raised in the US, have been resistant to the idea. \u201cTo me, wearing a mask feels natural,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they think it\u2019s weird -- they think I\u2019m overreacting.\u201d Xue remains undaunted, determined to shine a spotlight on the topic as she believes Americans are lagged behind in self-protection due to lack of accurate information. Feeling heartened by the sight of a growing number of people wearing masks outdoors -- observed during her occasional grocery shopping trips -- Xue thinks new US government guidance on the issue would not only prompt more Americans to cover their faces in public but also spur the demand for DIY masks.\u00a0 \u201cWhen I see my non-Chinese friends here, I tell them to wear a mask outside,\u201d she said, adding that she just ordered more bedsheets online. \u201cI say to them, I\u2019ll make you one if you don\u2019t have it.\u201d ##Daily Life## Nearly 8% of staff working for the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) are currently off sick, health minister Matt Hancock said in an interview with Sky News Friday. The British government has been under intense pressure to provide more support to frontline medical workers as they struggle to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Hancock said 5.7% of doctors were off work.  Health professional groups have said that up to a quarter of their members are off sick or self-isolating because of Covid-19 or exhibiting symptoms related to the virus, but Hancock said such figures are \u201cwrong.\" Still, he said that he wants to get the actual numbers much lower than they are. Part of that involves ramping up testing for NHS staff. Hancock said that as of Thursday morning, about 5,000 NHS staff had been tested.\u00a0 He also said that testing in the broader community will be ramped up and promised that the government would be able to carry out 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. ##Health## The true number of coronavirus cases across the world\u00a0could be \"five to 10 times\" higher than the 1 million confirmed Covid-19 infections that have already been confirmed globally, Australia's Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said at a news conference Friday. \"We know that judging by the death rate, the testing rate, in many countries they're not detecting all the cases. There are some countries that don't have the capacity to test,\" he said. \"In Australia, we're pretty confident that our testing has been the best in the world. Australia reported 248 new patients on Friday, bringing the countrywide total to 5,224, including 23 deaths. As of April 2, Australia had conducted over 270,000 tests, according to the Department of Health. Watch Murphy's comments:  ##Health## At least\u00a0245,559\u00a0cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.  Infections have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories. A total\u00a0of 6,057\u00a0coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in the country as of early Friday morning on the East Coast. Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. ##Health## Global cases top 1 million: More than a million people have been infected with the novel coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University, a landmark moment in the growing worldwide pandemic. The worst affected countries are the United States, Italy and Spain, all of which have more than 100,000 cases. Italy's death toll nears 14,000: More than 53,000 deaths have been reported globally, according to Johns Hopkins. The countries with the highest number of fatalities are Italy, with 13,915 deaths, and Spain with 10,348. More than 1,000 people have died in Germany: A rise of 145 fatalities in just 24 hours has pushed the number of recorded deaths from the coronavirus to over 1,000 in Germany. The country's total number of confirmed cases is approaching 80,000.

Wuhan official tells resident to not go out unless necessary: China's apparent success at controlling the coronavirus epidemic has given hope to the rest of the world amid a growing pandemic. But today the Communist Party Chief in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the outbreak, warned residents to only go out of their homes if necessary, showing the strict measures are likely to remain for a little longer at least. Time for national stay-at home order, Fauci says: Top US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci told a CNN town hall Thursday night that it was time to put in place a nationwide order for citizens to stay at home unless absolutely necessary. \"I don't understand why that's not happening,\" he said. President Trump has previously called for flexibility between states. US to issue nationwide guidance on face masks: In a news conference Thursday, President Donald Trump said that US regulations on face masks would be announced soon, but added they likely wouldn't be mandatory.  It's the piece of advice long-timers offer nearly every new arrival to President Donald Trump's ranks: bring visual aids. Luckily for Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, charts are their thing. Summoned to the Oval Office last weekend to state their case for keeping the country closed, Fauci and Birx arrived armed with tangled multicolored lines, stippled mountains of various heights and one ominous inky blue bell curve showing American deaths from coronavirus rising to 2.2 million if social distancing efforts were abandoned. The graphics were weaponry in a pitched battle with some of Trump's economic advisers -- and at times with Trump himself -- who argued continued restrictions against large gatherings were ravaging the American economy.  Evidence of that was delivered Thursday when the federal government announced jobless claims skyrocketed to 6.6 million last week.\u00a0 Still, the charts -- printed in color and blown up for effect -- seemed to work, even as some of Trump's advisers now question their accuracy. Trump announced hours later he was extending his coronavirus guidelines another 30 days, despite a strong inclination to open the nation for business. As the pandemic rages and Trump's response comes under withering scrutiny, Fauci and Birx -- the two top medical experts on the White House coronavirus task force -- have emerged as central figures advising Trump and fixations for a nation grappling with a generation-defining crisis.

The 29-year-old man, surnamed Guo, flew from Beijing to Milan on March 1 and returned to China on March 7, according to the country's Ministry of Public Security.  He took a train to his hometown of Zhengzhou, in Henan province, that same day, and then took the subway to work on March 8 and March 9. Local\u00a0police quickly found out about his travel history. On March 11, Guo was charged with obstructing the prevention of infectious diseases.  Guo was confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, and more than 40 close contacts were placed in quarantine. ##Daily Life## Germany\u2019s coronavirus death toll has reached 1,017 -- an increase of 145 fatalities in the past 24 hours -- according to figures released on Friday by the Robert Koch Institute, the country's federal public health agency.  Since the outbreak began, Germany has confirmed 79,696 Covid-19 patients. The number of cases jumped by 6,174 from Thursday to Friday. ##Health## Health officials say 71 people infected with the novel coronavirus in California's Sacramento County are connected to a single church, making it one of the largest outbreak clusters in the United States.  But despite dozens falling ill, and one death, church leaders have rebuffed demands to halt gatherings, officials say. The outbreak occurred at Bethany Slavic Missionary Church in Rancho Cordova, where members of the church and others associated with the congregation are confirmed to have been infected with the virus, Sacramento County health officials said. The church is a large and influential institution among the Northern California slavic community.\u00a0 The head pastor, Reverend Adam Bondaruk, has also contracted the virus, according to associate Pastor Ivan Gavrilyuk. Gavrilyuk told CNN that the church suspended services two weeks ago in accordance with health regulations. He would not confirm if the person who died from complications of the virus was a member of the congregation.\u00a0 In a statement to CNN on Thursday night, the church said it believed in complying with government regulations. Here's what they said: \u201cThis church has complied with all applicable Covid-19 regulations immediately after they came into effect. The church closed its doors on March 18th. At this time, the Church remains closed. All services, departments, and activities are conducted solely online.\u201d The statement did not address concerns that members were still gathering elsewhere. Health officials want more help: County health officials said they are frustrated that the church leaders won\u2019t work with the department to prevent further spread of the virus.  In an interview with the\u00a0Sacramento Bee, Sacramento\u00a0County Health Director\u00a0Dr. Peter Beilenson said the church \"basically told us to leave them alone.\u201d \u201cThis is extremely irresponsible and dangerous for the community,\u201d he said. The health department\u00a0believes the virus is being spread during Bible study and fellowship meetings in small groups at congregants homes.\u00a0 County health spokeswoman Janna Haynes said they are very concerned about the upcoming holidays of Palm Sunday and Easter -- when church members and their families traditionally get together to celebrate -- and is deploying translators to plead with the Russian-speaking community to stay home. Haynes said some of those they are attempting to reach don\u2019t monitor mainstream news outlets and haven\u2019t gotten the message about isolation. In an interview Thursday night on the local Russian language radio station, Ethno FM, and translated for CNN, church Pastor Pavel Gurzhiy reportedly downplayed the seriousness of the situation.  \u201cMy estimation is that no less people are sick with the flu,\u201d Gurzhiy said. \u201cSeventy-one sick members against 5,000 is not too many to be honest with you.\u201d The pastor said he knew of five people who had been infected with the virus. ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Health## Prince Charles is expected to open a new coronavirus field hospital, NHS Nightingale, via video link on Friday from his home in Scotland, according to a statement from Clarence House.\u00a0 NHS Nightingale is a new hospital that can provide support for potentially several thousand patients with coronavirus.  Based at the ExCeL conference center in East London, it\u00a0will initially provide up to 500 beds equipped with ventilators and oxygen. The\u00a0capacity will then continue to increase, potentially up to several thousand beds,\u00a0should it be required, according to the statement.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The Prince will also\u00a0say a few words in tribute to all those who have worked tirelessly to create the new\u00a0medical facility and to people across the UK who continue to deliver frontline care to\u00a0those affected by the coronavirus crisis,\" the statement read. Charles, the heir to the British throne, tested positive for the virus last month. He only showed minor symptoms and has since been released from isolation in good health. ##Health## Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike is asking residents of the prefecture to refrain from going outdoors unless necessary this weekend in order to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Japan reported 235 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Friday morning, bringing the total number of recorded cases in the country to 3,329. The capital Tokyo saw its largest single-day rise yet of 97 cases. There are now 684 infections in the city. Koike warned that the situation in the Japanese megacity is worsening and could be on the verge of a massive outbreak. Following the spike in infections in Tokyo and other cities, Japan is scrambling to avert an explosive uptick in cases as public pressure mounts on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency. Such a move would allow prefectural governors to send out a stronger message when it comes to urging the public to stay at home, but the measures will not be legally binding. Supermarkets, pharmacies, banks and the Tokyo Stock Exchange will remain open even in the event of a state of emergency. Publicly-funded high schools in Tokyo will remain closed until May 6, but some schools will reopen as scheduled next week. Museums, zoos and other venues run by the city will remain closed until the end of Golden Week, a nationwide national holiday that runs until May 6. Koike also asked citizens again to stay away from nightclubs and other nightspots. Koike said she will repeat her request if the Abe government declares a state of emergency.

Of those, just over 80,000 were in mainland China, which was then slowly beginning to bring its local epidemic under control. Since then, the number of cases around the world has skyrocketed. One month later, on April 3, there are more than 1 million infections globally. Nowhere is this more clear than in the United States. On March 3, the country had recorded 118 cases, according to Johns Hopkins. It now has more than 245,000. Just over a month ago, on March 1, Kings County in Washington state announced the first death from the coronavirus in the United States. As of today, there are nearly 6,000 deaths in the US. Some US government estimates show a worst-case scenario with a death toll for the country that runs into the hundreds of thousands. It still isn't clear when we will see a peak of the pandemic. While some countries are seeing a drop in the rate of new daily infections, such as South Korea, others are experiencing a second wave. Speaking at a CNN town hall on Thursday, top US infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said that it could be some time before widespread lockdowns and stay-at-home orders have an effect on death tolls and infection counts. \"Even when you suppress or\u00a0stabilize the number of new\u00a0infections, it's still going to take\u00a0a little while before you\u00a0decrease in hospitalizations, a\u00a0decrease in intensive care and\u00a0a decrease in deaths.\u00a0And in fact, deaths are the last thing that lag. So you could be doing well, and having a good effect on mitigation, and still see the deaths go up,\" Fauci said. ##Health## ##Daily Life## The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in consultation with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issued new guidance Thursday to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in long-term care facilities like nursing homes.  Long-term care facilities are now advising: To immediately start screening staff for symptoms and start temperature checks. Every resident should also have their temperature checked every day. \nPatients and residents who are entering the facilities should also be screened for Covid-19.\nStaff should wear a face mask inside the facility. \nIf there is a Covid-19 case in the facility, health care personnel should wear full personal protective equipment for the care of all residents, regardless of a resident\u2019s diagnosis or symptoms. \nResidents are encouraged to cover their noses and mouths when staff are in their room. \u201cResidents can use tissues for this,\u201d the guidance said. \u201cThey could also use cloth, non-medical masks when those are available.\u201d\nFacilities should use the same staff for the same patients, regardless of symptoms or Covid-19 status. The goal is to decrease the number of different staff interacting with patients and residents, and the number of times staff interact with patients. The hope is a staff member who works with the same resident would be able to detect symptoms early, if the patient or resident gets infected.\nFacilities are encouraged to separate infected patients and residents from those who are not sick. The CDC said Tuesday that around 400 long-term care facilities have at least one Covid-19 patient. The elderly and people with underlying health conditions face greater risks of complications if they contract the virus. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Authorities have begun moving sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt who have tested negative for coronavirus to hotel rooms in Guam, a US Navy commander said Friday. The first group of 180 sailors were moved from the aircraft carrier into commercial lodging in Guam's Tumon district Thursday night local time, Adm. John Menoni, the Navy's commander for the Marianas joint region, said at a news conference. Another 300 to 500 sailors will be moved in the next 12 to 24 hours, he said. During the military transportation process, the sailors are maintaining proper social distancing. A US defense official told CNN on Thursday that 114 sailors from the aircraft carrier have tested positive for coronavirus. They represent more than 10% of all cases across the US military. They're being moved just a day after the ship's commander\u00a0was relieved of duty for showing \"poor judgment,\" days after writing a memo warning Navy leadership that decisive action was needed to save the lives of the ship's crew.

But please remember, none of us are alone. The strength of 1.3 billion Indians is with and every one of us,\u201d the Prime Minister said.  Modi asked the public to switch off all lights and stand on balconies for nine minutes on Sunday, April 5 with lit candles, diya (small oil lamps), torches or cell phone flashlights to show solidarity and the strength of the public in the fight against coronavirus. \"This is to show that we are not alone, all 1.3 billion people of India stand together,\" Modi said.\u00a0 More than 2,300 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in India, according to the country's Ministry of Health.

Travel restrictions in place across most of the country are gradually being relaxed, and next week people will be allowed to leave Wuhan -- where the virus was first detected late last year --\u00a0for the first time in more than two months. But as China appears to be turning a page on the virus, new questions are being raised about how much the numbers being reported can be trusted, and whether the worst of the outbreak has truly passed. That was a suggestion Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying\u00a0angrily refuted\u00a0Thursday, saying the country \"has been giving open, transparent and timely updates to the world.\" \"On international public health security, we should listen to World Health Organization and experts on epidemiology and disease control rather than several politicians who are habitual liars,\" she said. Read the full story here: ##Daily Life## Residents of Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province and ground zero for the coronavirus pandemic, should only go outside when necessary as the city begins to open up following two months of lockdown, officials said. In a statement issued on Thursday, Wang Zhonglin, Wuhan's Communist Party chief, said people in Wuhan should keep practicing epidemic prevention and control measures as life slowly returns to normal. He also said that residents must take precautions like wearing masks when they leave home and then take their temperature once they return. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is advising people in his city to wear some sort of face covering in public. The issue of who should wear face masks and when has become hotly debated, especially due to potential shortages of personal protective equipment for frontline medical workers.  \"Los Angeles is a leader in responding to this global crisis, and that\u2019s why I want to share the latest guidance from public health experts on how you can help protect yourself and those around you from infection. As we learn more about this virus, we will continue to update our guidance so we don\u2019t just flatten the curve, but get ahead of it,\" Garcetti said. \n\"Early data suggests that many who are infected with Covid-19 do not have symptoms, which is why everyone should wear cloth face coverings when leaving the house for essential activities. However, a face covering is not a substitute for other critical measures -- most importantly, staying home as much as possible, washing hands frequently, and practicing safe physical distancing in all settings.\" The city's guidance can be found here US public health officials at first advised against wearing masks, but may be shifting course. On Monday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert\u00a0Redfield,\u00a0told NPR that his organization was reviewing its guidelines and\u00a0may recommend general mask use\u00a0to guard against community infection. President Trump said the government plans to release new recommendations on face masks in the coming days. The World Health Organization has refrained from advising the general public from wearing masks. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the WHO's Covid-19 response, chimed in on the current debate about when to wear face masks and who should be wearing them at CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday. She said the organization currently recommends that people who are ill or caring for the sick wear normal medical masks, while the more efficient N95s should be saved for frontline health-care workers. The WHO is studying other options, like whether the general public should use scarves to cover themselves. \"We have to prioritize the use\u00a0of masks for frontline workers,\u00a0if that is one thing I can\u00a0stress,\" Van Kerkhove said.\u00a0\"Medical masks, respirators,\u00a0gloves, gowns, these are people\u00a0who are putting their lives on\u00a0the line to help us, to care\u00a0for other people and they must\u00a0be protected,\" she said.

The airline said it flew just 582 passengers in one day this week, down more than 99% on its daily expectations. The airline usually expects to fly around 100,000 passengers a day. In an internal memo shared with CNN, Cathay Pacific's CEO Augustus Tang said that the \"economic implications associated with the COVID-19's global pandemic is intensifying\" and that \"our passenger fleet has been virtually grounded as the remaining demand has disappeared.\" \nTang said that due to the pandemic, \"passenger capacity will now be reduced further from the skeleton schedule previously announced,\" adding, \"We will continue to monitor flights closely and may make further reductions if necessary.\" The new cost-saving measures come after Cathay announced last month that it would halt all flights on its low-cost carrier HK Express and cut passenger capacity on Cathay Pacific by 96%. The airline will now only operate two long-haul flights per week to four destinations: London, Los Angeles, Vancouver and Sydney. In Asia, Cathay will maintain three weekly flights to eight destinations including Tokyo, Manila and Singapore.\u00a0\u00a0 Tang said that he and Cathay chairman Patrick Healy will be taking a 30% cut in base salary, while executive directors will each see their salaries cut by 25% from April to December. He warned that employees in regions where capacity has been reduced or flights have been eliminated may need to take unpaid leave or furloughs. ##Business## The US Health and Human Services Department said Thursday\u00a0it had distributed some 192,000 N95 respirator masks\u00a0and a large haul of other\u00a0scarce medical supplies\u00a0that the FBI had seized during the arrest of a Brooklyn man. Baruch Feldheim, 43, was arrested Monday after he allegedly coughed on FBI agents and told them he had the coronavirus. Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Feldheim sold the\u00a0N95 masks\u00a0to doctors and nurses at inflated prices; in one instance at as much as a 700% markup.

I mean you can -- depending on the material, it\u2019s thicker,\u201d Trump said. Trump also said that new recommendations for civilians using masks will come out soon. Facts First:\u00a0Though he was addressing what citizens should do, Trump\u2019s claim that scarves can work better than masks is not supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\u00a0guidance for health care workers.  While scarves may offer some protection, the CDC's advice describes scarves as a possible last resort if masks are not available -- and urges workers to exercise caution if they are using scarves and other clothing, since their capacity to protect workers is \"unknown.\" When masks are no longer available, the CDC says workers\u00a0\u201cmight use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.\u201d The guidance also states that \u201ccaution should be exercised when considering this option\u201d and that face shields should be used in addition to these homemade masks.

They need the ventilator, or they die. It\u2019s that basic proposition,\u201d Cuomo said. Cuomo said the state has purchased 17,000 ventilators but they haven\u2019t been delivered because they are coming from China and there are 50 states and the federal government all competing for the equipment. New York only has 4,000 ventilators in the state, Cuomo said. \u201cObviously, nobody would say that this was the best way to do it,\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cto have 50 states compete, but that\u2019s where we are.\u201d Cuomo said that once New York runs out of ventilators, the state will have to share the machines between patients, use BiPap machines, anesthesia machines and other creative strategies such as canceling all non-elective surgeries to provide people the care they need. He also said he will redeploy the ventilators to the places that need them the most. President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to work with General Motors and Ford to manufacture more ventilators comes too late for the apex of the disease in New York, Cuomo said. Cuomo questioned why national resources couldn\u2019t be deployed to stay ahead of the curve.  \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a slow-moving hurricane across the country, where you know the path that it\u2019s taking. Why not deploy the national resources and just stay ahead of the hurricane?\u201d Cuomo asked. States, he said, cannot manage the ventilator problem on their own. \u201cI have a 50,000 bed health system. I don\u2019t have the resources to be able to build an additional 50,000 beds just in case there\u2019s a public health emergency and a pandemic every 10 years. You know, it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor said while the President has been critical of him during this pandemic, that they have a \u201cvery honest relationship.\u201d Trump helped New York convert the Javits Center into a 2,500-bed Covid-19 facility. \u201cI called him this morning. He got it done by the afternoon, so kudos the President,\u201d Cuomo said. ##Health## Japan is banning travelers who have recently visited any of over 70 countries and regions -- including the US, UK and China -- in the past 14 days, as of April 3.\u00a0 The new rules kick in for arrivals as of Friday, even for those whose flight departs before April 3, in an escalation of Japan's fight to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0 For now, there is no end date to the travel restriction.\u00a0 Surge in coronavirus cases: Following a spike in infections in Tokyo and other cities, Japan is scrambling to avert an explosive uptick in cases as public pressure mounts on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency.\u00a0 Emergency measures: A declaration of a state of emergency would allow prefectural governors to send out a stronger message when it comes to urging the public to stay at home, but the measures will not be legally binding. ##Travel## At least 10,062 cases of the novel coronavirus have now been recorded in South Korea, after a rise of 86 new infections were reported by authorities today.

Speaking at a CNN town hall on Thursday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he believed the order should be put in place, something President Donald Trump has been loathe to do. \"I don't understand why that's not\u00a0happening.\u00a0As you said, the tension\u00a0between federally mandated versus\u00a0states rights to do what they\u00a0want is something I don't want\u00a0to get into.\u00a0But if you look at what is going on\u00a0in this country, I do not\u00a0understand why we are not doing\u00a0that.\u00a0We really should be,\" Fauci said. Trump said Wednesday that he does not plan to issue such an order because different states have different levels of coronavirus cases. \u201cStates are\u00a0different and I understand that\u00a0the governor of Florida, great\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis issued one today and that\u2019s good, that\u2019s great.\u00a0But there are some states that are\u00a0different.\u00a0There are some states that don't\u00a0have much of a problem,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. The President said there should be some sort of flexibility among the states depending on how bad individual states situations might be. \u201cYou have to look -- you have to\u00a0give a little\u00a0flexibility.\u00a0If you have a state in the\u00a0Midwest, or if Alaska for\u00a0example doesn't have a problem,\u00a0it's awfully tough to say close it down.\u00a0We have to have a little bit of\u00a0flexibility,\u201d Trump said. ##Health## Japan reported 235 new cases of the novel coronavirus today, bringing the total number of recorded cases in the country to 3,329.

The new measures will begin in Peru today, President Martin Vizcarra announced to the nation on Thursday. So far, Peru has reported 1,414 cases of coronavirus and 55 deaths. \"Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,\" only men can be outside; \"Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, only women are allowed to circulate,\" said Vizcarra. The gender-based measure will be in effect until Sunday, April 12. It comes two days after Panama began restricting movement by gender, arguing the measure urges people to return home since their loves ones are not allowed to be outside. Peru said it would adopt the same system following the positive results the gender-based measure has yielded in other countries and due to its simplicity in visually detecting who should and shouldn't be out on the streets, Vizcarra explained. ##Daily Life## Facing a complete standstill across its entertainment empire due to the coronavirus crisis, the Walt Disney Company notified its employees that it would furlough employees \"whose jobs aren't necessary at this time\" starting on April 19. Disney has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic. Its theme parks around the world have shuttered, its cruise line is suspended and many of its biggest films of the year have been delayed. Live sporting events, the lifeblood of the Disney-owned ESPN, have also been suspended.  Shares of Disney have plummeted more than 30% year to date. The impact is hitting Disney's theme park employees especially hard. All of Disney's 12 theme parks have been shuttered since March 12, after which the company committed to paying salaries through April 18.  In the statement, the company said there was \"no clear indication of when we can restart our businesses,\" and that it was \"forced to make the difficult decision to take the next step and furlough employees.\"\u00a0 Among those impacted would be the Disney Parks' storied \"Imagineers,\" the designers of the parks, rides and hotels. The furloughed workers would remain employees of the company and keep their health benefits, while also being able to access federal and state aid like unemployment benefits. ##Business## For the third day in a row,\u00a0Brazil's health authorities reported a consecutive spike of more than 1,000 new novel coronavirus cases in a single day.

In many ways, the scarf is better. It's thicker.\" Trump also said a new guideline on masks is coming.\u00a0 \"I think they're going to be coming out with regulations on that. And if people want to abide by them, frankly, I don't think they'll be mandatory. Because some people don't want to do that. But If people want to -- as an example on the masks -- if people wanted to wear them they can,\" Trump said.\u00a0 Two people familiar told CNN that upon recommendation from the coronavirus task force, the President was expected to more forcefully encourage all Americans to wear face coverings outside their house. Some more background: The administration was working Thursday to complete the recommendations, which would advise Americans to use a face covering when leaving their homes. However, Trump said Thursday night,\u00a0\"A recommendation is coming out. We'll see what that recommendation is but I will say this: They can pretty much decide for themselves right now. CNN reported on Wednesday that most members of the task force have come to agree that Americans should begin wearing face coverings in public and could issue formal guidance on the matter soon. ##Health##"], "Language": false}
