There are not many news events in recent memory that have come close to the far-reaching implications in terms of our public health, social interactions, and the global economy; life as we know it has been altered.  From the beginning, CNN journalists have covered this unprecedented story from all corners of the globe. Three months since we heard the first whispers of a strange respiratory illness emerging in China, this is the story of a story -- from those who have witnessed and reported on it firsthand.  Wuhan: Ground zero On the final day of 2019, the World Health Organization receives word of a pneumonia-like disease in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. According to Wuhan Municipal Health, the cases occur between December 12 and December 29. The new decade begins with Chinese authorities closing the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market on January 1; health officials suspect wild animals sold at the market could be the source of the virus. David Culver, CNN International Correspondent, based in Beijing: Initially it was last year that...we got first word of something going on within Wuhan. I think my first reaction was, \"Well, where's Wuhan?\" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent: I was getting messages from colleagues at the National Academy of Medicine [in the US], basically saying, \"Red flag. Be on the lookout.\" And having covered a lot of these types of pandemics around the world, my antenna immediately went up. That was right at the beginning of all this. No one knew exactly where this was headed at that point, but that's when we really started paying attention. Nectar Gan, CNN Digital Reporter, based in Hong Kong: People were very nervous, watching this mysterious pneumonia developing across the border in China. I remember back in early January, the hospital authority in Hong Kong had already started recording all the suspected cases -- basically, people who travel to Wuhan and return to Hong Kong with either fever or cough or other respiratory symptoms, and it was playing in the news every day. Interactive: Tracking coronavirus' global spread Culver: It was a slow evolution as to what exactly was happening and how serious it was. And the initial reporting was surrounding this market, this seafood market, really, that was apparently selling wildlife illegally and that that was the real concern. And so, after that was shut down on January first, we thought, \"Well, perhaps that was the end of it.\" Clearly, it wasn't. 'A new virus'  On January 5, China confirms the respiratory cases are neither SARS nor MERS; two days later, authorities in the country declare it to be a novel coronavirus. The WHO initially names it 2019-nCov. Gan: It was basically a new virus that nobody has seen or known of before, so that's when we decided, okay, it's time that we put out a story to let the world know about this mysterious virus that's getting China and certainly Hong Kong very nervous. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN International Anchor and Correspondent, based in Hong Kong: Hong Kong is home to some world class infectious disease experts and they were puzzled. They didn't know what this was. But even back then, there were a lot of concerns here in Hong Kong because of course, the population here acutely remember just the scars from the SARS outbreak of almost two decades ago, and what the SARS outbreak did to the community here. 'We need to get you out of there' The first reported death is a 61-year-old man in Wuhan, announced on January 11. A second person dies within a week. Meanwhile, two travel-related cases are reported in Thailand and Japan. By mid-January, a CNN crew prepares to visit the epicenter in Wuhan. On January 21, the day before the team arrives, the first case on US soil is announced in Washington state. Culver: When we decided to go down to Wuhan, we really planned to be there for a few days. We checked in on [January 22] and we were focused on gathering as much as possible the first day that we were there. We went to the outskirts of the market. We went to the infectious disease hospital, mindful and careful not to get too close to expose ourselves.  For me, the moment that hit was a 3:30 am phone call from our senior producer in Beijing. And it was an urgency in his voice, \"Wuhan's going on lockdown. We need to get you out of there.\" And we had only a few hours to act. Wuhan on lockdown On January 22, following reports that the death toll has risen to 17, Wuhan announces a \"temporary\" closure of railway stations and the airport to prevent people from departing. A city of 11 million is suddenly on lockdown.  Culver: The team mobilized very quickly. We were able to get to a train station within Wuhan, and we looked around and realized this seemed to be the same concern and urgency that hundreds of other people were experiencing. At that time, it was 4:00 in the morning. I looked around and I said to myself, \"This is far more serious than I think we initially thought.\" Julia Chatterley, CNN Business Anchor, based in New York: I was in Davos, Switzerland (for the World Economic Forum annual meeting), and the conversation evolved in the space of one to two days from talking about business and climate to coronavirus and what...we were hearing from China. There'd been a few deaths, I think, at that point. And people were talking about whether this could be SARS round two, the same we saw in 2002. Even at that stage, we had no clue what we were about to see. Sara Sidner, CNN Correspondent, based in Los Angeles: What really struck me, when I knew that this was a dangerous and deadly virus, is when you saw the streets of Wuhan completely empty. Then when we heard the news that the doctor who had exposed the fact that this was happening there died. I thought, okay, this is really a different sort of thing. We're not talking about the flu, we're not talking about even H1N1 or SARS. 'Outpouring of anger' The doctor is Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in a Wuhan hospital. As early as December, before Wuhan health authorities even announced the outbreak, he had been trying to warn colleagues and friends on social media.  Culver: I reflect on Dr. Li Wenliang's story a lot...I think the reason he became such a national figure here and a hero in some cases is because he didn't want to be a hero. This was a guy who simply wanted to let his friends and their relatives know, \"Hey, something's going around. This might be like SARS. I'm not sure, but just be careful.\" And it was shared and it went public really quickly and it got him in a lot of trouble. Police reprimanded him. They brought him in, essentially said, \"You're not to be spreading these rumors.\" And he went back to work...he was exposed to this virus and he got it, and it took him down quite quickly. Gan: We spoke to Dr. Li Wenliang back in late January when he was actually lying on his ICU bed trying to fight the coronavirus inside him, but then we really did not expect the fact that he would die in about a week's time. He told us he was recovering. I remember watching the Chinese social media and the outpouring of anger, of grief was something I've not seen in recent years. It was just unprecedented. Culver: I think what's so alarming about his situation was, here's a guy who's 34 years old. He's a young guy, really didn't want this attention. Simply wanted to help his friends and keep them on the lookout for what could be a dangerous virus -- and even the Supreme Court here in China acknowledged had his warning not been reprimanded, but rather publicized and perhaps supported, things could have been a lot different. The virus spreads As January turns to February, more and more cases begin to appear outside mainland China. On February 4, the Japanese Health Ministry reports 10 positive cases aboard a cruise ship in Yokohama Bay. Will Ripley, CNN International Correspondent, based in Hong Kong: When I arrived here in Japan in early February, the big story was the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. There were 3,700 people on board, and once they started testing for coronavirus, the number of cases jumped from the dozens to the hundreds. And for a time it was the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside of mainland China.   I think at that point I realized just how infectious this virus is, how contagious it is, and how dangerous it is, especially when people from the cruise ship started to die. We watched in real time how a government attempt to contain this virus failed. Culver: Going onto social media and seeing that folks back in Europe or in the States were very calm about the whole situation and going to gyms and going to restaurants and crowded spaces -- for me it was a bit jarring to see that knowing what could potentially be heading their way. Italy the epicenter Not only is it heading their way, it is already there. It soon becomes clear Italy is the epicenter in Europe. On February 25, in an attempt to contain the spread, the Lombardy region of the country issues a complete lockdown of some 100,000 people. In Spain, cities like Madrid are not far behind. Ben Wedeman, CNN Senior International Correspondent, based in Beirut: We were outside a caf\u00e9 [in northern Italy] and there were some young students who were obviously out of school. These were university students sitting around having the last drinks before the bar closed. And they were completely relaxed about it. They said, \"we're young, we have nothing to worry about.\" Stout: It breaks my heart to see the situation in Wuhan being repeated elsewhere in communities in Italy, in Spain, even in the United States right now. We have reported on the horrors that medical staff have been going through in Wuhan with not enough beds, not enough respirators, not enough protective equipment. The warnings were out there. Wedeman: The numbers [in Italy] really started to skyrocket, and the area of lockdown became the entire country of more than 60 million people. And I think that's when it became clear that this was not a local problem of just a few towns and villages. This was a problem throughout the entire country, throughout Europe, and now throughout the world. US records its first death On February 29, the United States records its first death due to the virus. The patient is in Washington state; the outbreak appears to be a cluster in a nursing home in Kirkland, near Seattle.    Sidner: I came to Kirkland about a week after it was discovered that someone had died from coronavirus, and not just one person, but that there were several people dealing with some kind of terrible respiratory problem inside of a nursing home at the Life Care Center. Everything went wrong within hours, in one case, one of the nurses told us. The way she described it was that it was like a battlefield. And in this "], "Language": false}
