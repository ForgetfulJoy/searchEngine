Taye Diggs returned as host of the event and made sure to keep the crowd laughing. Eddie Murphy received a lifetime achievement award, while Kristen Bell, who was honored with the #SeeHer Award, moved the audience with an inspiring speech. \"My immediate reaction is always to answer with words like 'strong' and 'brave' and 'powerful,' but if I'm being honest, to me, being a woman is not about being brave or being strong or being powerful. It's not about being anything specific,\" Bell said. \"It's just about giving yourself permission to be the things that you already are, which seems very easy, but it is not. Because women have been conditioned to fit into boxes; usually tiny, pretty, sparkly boxes with bows on the them.\" The night's top prize for best picture went to \"Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood.\" For a full list of the winners see below.
