Economy\u00a0 President Trump is expected to announce an economic stimulus plan this afternoon in hopes of bolstering a market laid low by coronavirus fears and an upheaval in oil prices. Trump said his administration will seek a payroll tax cut and will consider relief options for hourly workers. Those in the struggling airline, cruise and hospitality industries may get some tax help, and several White House officials have supported the idea of expanding paid sick leave to avoid the risk of people going to work ill for fear of losing pay. None of this is a done deal yet, and GOP leaders have been coy about which\u00a0provisions they agree upon so far. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Exchange is pumping at least $50 billion into the financial system to ease stress on the markets after the Dow briefly plunged more than 2,000 points yesterday.\u00a0 2. Coronavirus\u00a0 All of Italy and its 60 million residents are under lockdown as coronavirus cases now exceed\u00a0113,000 worldwide. Cases of the virus are mounting in the US, and it seems like there's a never-ending stream of cancellations and precautions being activated to curb the spread. Sports leagues are restricting locker room access, bands have postponed tour dates, and in Ireland, St. Patrick's Day parades have been scratched. However, in China and South Korea, coronavirus cases seem to have tapered off. The Chinese province of Hubei will start gradually lifting travel restrictions within the region,\u00a0and South Korea's health minister says he thinks his\u00a0country may have passed the peak of the outbreak.\u00a0 3. Election 2020 Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state all\u00a0hold\u00a0primary elections today, and the outcome could make the path to the Democratic presidential nomination\u00a0clearer than ever. The biggest contest of the day will be Michigan, which has 125 pledged delegates up for grabs. Joe Biden has a leg up over Bernie Sanders in the state, according to recent polls (though\u00a0it's worth noting Michigan polls before the 2016 primary were inaccurate). Biden also enters\u00a0the day with another big endorsement in his cap: former presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker. Today's contests are considered a do-or-die set for Bernie Sanders before the primary calendar shifts to more Biden-friendly states. Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio vote next week, all places where Sanders lost to Clinton in 2016's primaries.\u00a0 4. Royals Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex attended their last engagement as senior members of the royal family at\u00a0the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey. The event was the first time Meghan and the Queen have been seen together since she and Harry announced in January they'd decided\u00a0to step back from\u00a0royal life,\u00a0shaking\u00a0the foundations of the royal family.\u00a0Meghan and Harry will officially bow out as senior royals on March 31\u00a0and then enter a 12-month transition period\u00a0as they work on establishing their nonprofit organization. 5. Horse racing Twenty-seven prominent\u00a0horse trainers, veterinarians and drug distributors\u00a0have been indicted in a worldwide scheme to\u00a0give racehorses performance-enhancing drugs to help them win. Prosecutors say the drugs and their effects\u00a0led horses to\u00a0injury, illness\u00a0and, in some cases, death. Some involved in the scheme allegedly were tasked with getting rid of dead animals without properly reporting them. Trainer Jason Servis is among the defendants, and prosecutors say he \"doped virtually all horses under his control,\" including Maximum Security,\u00a0who\u00a0crossed the finish line first at last year's Kentucky Derby but was disqualified for interference. Just to give an idea of how much money is at stake with such a scheme,\u00a0Maximum Security recently won $10 million in the inaugural Saudi Cup.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Starbucks is testing a new kind of cup\u00a0 Sadly, it's not filled with endless coffee.\u00a0 The psychology of why people panic-buy toilet paper, of all things\u00a0 Yeah, what happened to the old milk-and-bread combo?\u00a0 Dolly Parton wants to be on the cover of Playboy for her 75th birthday Give the queen what she wants!\u00a0 A confused 'American Idol' contestant thought Pat Sajak and Justin Timberlake were judges on the show Timberlake, we get, but why did he think of\u00a0Pat Sajak, of all people?\u00a0 A new study concludes\u00a0that money can buy happiness\u00a0 It can pay for rent, mortgages, food, education, medical care, clothing and basically everything we need to stay alive, so, yeah, that feels a lot like happiness.\u00a0 TODAY'S NUMBER 8,600 That's how many troops the US initially will leave in Afghanistan under the government's recent agreement with the Taliban. Withdrawal efforts began this week, with some 12,000 to 13,000 American troops still in the country.\u00a0 TODAY'S QUOTE \"These proposals will help us to tell the story of people and places that for too long have been neglected or marginalized.\" Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, voicing support for a bill that allows local governments in Virginia to vote to take down Confederate statues and monuments. The bill passed the state's House and Senate and will likely be signed into law by Northam.  TODAY'S WEATHER AND FINALLY How the Madame Tussauds wax sculptures are made Hyperrealistic sculpture videos are fascinating, but it's really hard finding one that doesn't open with someone popping in a fake eyeball. No one needs to see that first thing in the morning. Don't worry, though,\u00a0this one's safe. (Click here to view.)"], "Language": false}
