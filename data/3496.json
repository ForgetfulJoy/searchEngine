Coronavirus\u00a0 The US Navy Hospital Ship Comfort has docked in New York City as the US faces what could be its most difficult month in the coronavirus pandemic. More than 3,000 people have died of the virus on American soil, and experts worry that when the outbreak\u00a0reaches its predicted peak in mid-April, more than 2,000 people could die a day. About 82,000 people could die in all by August, even with social distancing measures, according to one model cited by the White House. However, there\u00a0may be\u00a0some bright spots in the dark days ahead: Hospitals in the Northern California region are cautiously hopeful that they may be seeing the first benefits of shelter-at-home precautions in the form of slightly less crushing surges of patients. Follow here for more updates.\u00a0 2. Health\u00a0 The race is on for companies to test possible coronavirus treatments and vaccines.\u00a0Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson says it\u00a0plans to begin human clinical trials of a Covid-19 vaccine by September, with a goal of the first batches being available for emergency use early next year. Other smaller biotech companies are also working on potential vaccines, but more immediate hope may be found in treatments that are already available for other ailments.\u00a0The WHO has\u00a0begun clinical tests of\u00a0remdesivir, a drug\u00a0originally used against Ebola and other highly contagious diseases, on\u00a0patients in Spain and Norway. Meanwhile, Chinese health officials have been testing a rheumatoid arthritis drug, Roche's Actemra, on Covid-19 patients there. 3. Economy\u00a0 House Democrats are eyeing an ambitious fourth coronavirus response package that they hope will include more direct payments to individuals,\u00a0money for state and local governments, and funding for infrastructure. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said if such measures aren't covered, the economic situation could get even more dangerous\u00a0for Americans, even with the recently passed $2.2 trillion relief bill. Some parts of the economy are already feeling the pain. Macy's announced it is furloughing a majority of its 125,000 employees because of the pandemic, which has sunk sales and forced store closures. The price of oil has crashed to a new 18-year low as coronavirus measures continue to suffocate energy demand. Even Amazon, which has seen customer demand soar, is facing controversy after firing an employee who led a\u00a0walkout at the company's Staten Island warehouse.\u00a0 4. Transgender rights Idaho's Republican Gov.\u00a0Brad Little signed into law two bills that limit the rights of transgender people, prompting outcry from LGBTQ and human rights advocates. One bill, the\u00a0Fairness in Women's Sports Act, bans transgender girls from playing on girls' and women's sports teams. The bill makes Idaho the first state to pass legislation against transgender students, the ACLU says, adding that the measure violates\u00a0policies set by the Idaho High School Activities Association.\u00a0The second bill\u00a0prohibits transgender people from changing their gender on Idaho birth certificates. A\u00a0federal court struck down a similar bill\u00a0in 2018.\u00a0 5. Hungary Hungary's parliament has voted to let Prime Minister Viktor Orban rule by decree indefinitely, opening the door for the populist leader to enforce all kinds of restrictive policies. The move was made as a protective measure of sorts against the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic. Orban can now\u00a0bypass a number of democratic institutions to, for instance, suspend parliament, punish journalists over coronavirus reporting, and enact heavier penalties for violating quarantine regulations. The leader has already attracted criticism from other EU members for his\u00a0country's hard-line immigration policies and his attempts to consolidate\u00a0power, so these measures are likely to cause even more friction. \u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Taco Bell will give you a free taco today Following proper social distancing protocols, of course.\u00a0 Deepak Chopra's meditation streamed crashed because so many people tuned in to see the wellness guru\u00a0 WE JUST WANT TO FEEL BETTER, OK.\u00a0 Top chefs share their go-to comfort foods\u00a0 Spoiler: There are a lot of carbs.\u00a0 A man allegedly teaching his dog to drive was arrested after a high-speed chase\u00a0 Ah, the old \"teaching my dog how to drive\" excuse.\u00a0 A zoo in Belgium shared adorable photos of\u00a0orangutans playing with otters\u00a0 Everyone say thank you to Pairi Daiza zoo for this lovely gift.\u00a0 HAPPENING LATER Harry and Meghan say goodbye to royal life\u00a0 Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, officially relinquish their royal duties today and start a new life.
