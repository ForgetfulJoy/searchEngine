Despite that announcement, Marrero said, more than 32,000 foreign tourists remained on the island. Starting Tuesday, he announced, tourists would be banned from leaving their hotels as the government worked to return them to their home countries.\u00a0 \u201cNo one can go into the street,\u201d Marrero said of the tourists. School classes would be suspended starting Tuesday until at least April 20, he announced. All Cubans are required to study in state-run schools. So far, Cuba has announced the island has 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 1,036 people have been hospitalized for observation. Marrero also announced that Cubans waiting in \u201ccolas\u201d or long lines for hard to find items would need to keep at least one meter (approximately 3 feet) in distance from other people.

Jay Inslee issued a new order Monday night that requires residents to stay at home for the next two weeks. The order takes effect immediately. Exceptions were made for jobs deemed critical and grocery shopping. \"This weapon \u2014 distancing ourselves \u2014 is the only weapon we have against this virus,\" Inslee said in a televised address. \u00a0##Health## One of Chicago\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals had to scrap plans to host a mobile testing site, which was scheduled Tuesday on the city\u2019s north side after it said both of its vendors weren\u2019t able to fill orders for testing supplies. It\u2019s another example of how difficult it can be to get tested for Covid-19. Julie Pesch, spokesperson for Lurie\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, told CNN the\u00a0site was designed to be for pediatric patients not admitted to the hospital who are experiencing symptoms of the virus. The hospital was hoping to alleviate an onslaught of pressure both its hospital and individual pediatricians across the city are facing. But because of the high demand for testing and a lack of testing supplies like nasal swabs, those plans were cut short on Friday.\u00a0 \u201cOur normal operational process is to hold 2-4 days of supply on a product like this.\u00a0Last week (March 16) when we went to purchase an elevated quantity, due to the Covid-19 needs, we were informed by both our primary\u00a0and secondary vendors that they were not able to fill orders,\u201d\u00a0Pesch said\u00a0 The hospital was hoping parents\u00a0with an appointment would be able to get a\u00a0child tested every 15 minutes. But now the hospital says sick patients will need to go through their regular pediatricians for testing. The lack of supplies to launch such an effort \u201cis a big deal,\u201d Pesch said. \u201cThe more testing that we can do, that means the less children that we have in the emergency department, in the pediatrician's office. That means we don\u2019t have to use as much PPE. That is the main message that we\u2019re trying to get across.\u201d \u201cOther hospitals are in the same situation,\u201d said\u00a0Danny Chun, spokesperson for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association. The lack of testing supplies remain a problem, he added. The Advocate Aurora Health hospital system announced Friday that it\u00a0was suspending\u00a0a similar program that had already launched because of the\u00a0national\u00a0shortage of test kit supplies. ##Health## A Fort Jackson, South Carolina, officer and a soldier have both tested positive for Covid-19, according to a statement Monday.\u00a0 Both service members are in isolation and receiving the necessary medical care, and the Fort Jackson Public Health Team is working to identify anyone else who may have been exposed to the virus, according to the statement from Fort Jackson Commander Brig. Gen. Milford H. Beagle Jr.\u00a0 Following the announcement of the two cases, Fort Jackson tweeted to visitors, urging them \"to plan ahead and to expect delays at Gates 1, 2, and 4\" as \"the Department of the Army Security Guards are conducting a general health & welfare assessment, including a temperature check, of everyone entering Fort Jackson.\" ##Health## First lady Melania Trump has been tested for coronavirus and is doing fine, President Trump said at Monday's briefing. This is the first time the President confirmed his wife was also tested for Covid-19. The President, Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have all been tested for coronavirus, and all were negative.  \u201cThe first lady was tested on the same night as President Trump was tested, out of an abundance of caution. The test was negative,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN. Both Trumps were tested at the White House on March 13. ##Health## In response to numerous reports of gatherings at parks and beaches over the weekend, San Diego will move forward with the closure of all parks, beaches, boardwalks, city lakes and trails, Mayor Kevin Faulconer announced at a news conference Monday.\u00a0 \"It's time to protect each other,\" he said. \"Physical distance is the key to beating this virus and that is why we're acting today. It is simply irresponsible to congregate and it is unfair to the rest of San Diego.\" Faulconer went on to say that San Diego police officers will be permitted to enforce the new rules with fines. ##Daily Life## Holland America\u2019s Zaandam ship headed toward Florida is carrying 42 people \u2014 13 guests and 29 crew\u00a0\u2014 reporting flu-like symptoms. \u201cSince it is flu season, and COVID-19 testing is not available on board, it is difficult to determine the cause of these elevated cases at this time,\u201d according to a statement from the cruise line's website. The guests have been asked by the cruise line to remain in their staterooms until they have more information and as the ship sails north with the intention to arrive in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on March 30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zaandam departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7,\u00a0\u00a0prior to Holland America\u2019s decision to suspend its global cruise operations for 30 days. The trip was scheduled to end in San Antonio, Chile, on March 21.\u00a0 According to the statement, no one has been off the ship since March 14 after a stop in Puenta Arena, Chile, where guests were initially told they could disembark for flights, but then were not allowed. There are a total of 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board the ship. ##Health## The national governing body of gymnastics in the United States said the organization is\u00a0\u201cadvocating for the postponement\u201d\u00a0of this summer\u2019s Olympic Games. In a tweet from the verified account of USA Gymnastics, the call to action states,\u00a0\u201cAfter considering the responses from athletes who participated in our survey & the 62% who were in favor of delaying the Games, we are adding our voice to the chorus advocating for postponement. We are grateful to have our athletes\u2019 insight and input to guide this decision.\u201d ##Daily Life## President Trump was pressed Monday about whether any of the doctors on the coronavirus task force have endorsed easing the federal guidelines. Trump said the doctors had \u201cnot endorsed, but we talk together and I think they\u2019re OK with it and I\u2019m OK with it.\" \"But this could be a much bigger\u00a0problem.\u00a0This could create a much bigger\u00a0problem than the problem that\u00a0you start off with,\" he added. Trump went on to repeat what he said earlier in the briefing that \u201cwe can do both\u201d as in easing federal guidelines in some places to boost the economy, but still focus on certain hotspots. ##Health## President Trump acknowledged Monday the effects of coronavirus are likely to worsen. \"Certainly this is going to be bad,\u201d Trump said, agreeing with remarks his surgeon general made earlier in the day predicting a deteriorating situation this week.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it much much less bad,\" Trump went on. \"Obviously the numbers are going to increase with time and then they're going to decrease.\u201d The President seemed to downplay the situation somewhat, indicating the flu presented a similarly poor outlook: \u201cWe have a lot of people dying from the flu,\u201d he said. He suggested the period of national self-isolation guidance would not last months as he looks to restart the American economy. \u201cI'm not looking at months, I'll tell you right now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up our country.\u201d Trump repeatedly said the period of containment measures recommended by the federal government wouldn\u2019t stretch to three or four months. He wouldn\u2019t put a firm timeline on when the recommendations on social distancing would end. Watch here: ##Health## Vice President Mike Pence said the Food and Drug Administration has approved self-collected samples for Covid-19 testing, which he said would reduce the strain on medical supplies and professionals. Pence said he and President Trump had asked the FDA to pursue\u00a0\u201cless invasive methods of testing\u201d after they both endured their own tests, which require deep nasal swabs. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to report that self-collected swabs can now be collected in clinics and drive-through testing sites,\u201d Pence said. He said asking doctors to perform the swabs creates a \u201cdrain on personal protective equipment.\u201d\u00a0 Medical professionals will still perform the actual tests on the swabs that patients take and hand in at health care facilities. Watch here: ##Health## Vice President Mike Pence said during Monday's White House press briefing that 313,000 coronavirus tests having been completed with more than 41,000 tests having come back positive.  In the past, Pence noted the testing numbers he provides do not include community hospitals or community labs, but he did not make that disclaimer during the press briefing Monday. He added all state and hospital labs are now required to report their coronavirus test numbers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \u201cWe also reminded the governors\u00a0today that all state\u00a0laboratories, all hospital\u00a0laboratories, are now required,\u00a0by law, to report the results of\u00a0coronavirus tests to the CDC,\u201d Pence said. ##Health## New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted Monday that she instituting a \u201cstatewide stay-at-home instruction.\" \u201cAll New Mexicans are instructed to stay at home except for outings essential to health, safety, and welfare,\u201d Grisham tweeted. The governor also declared that \u201call businesses except those deemed essential to public health, safety and well-being will be ordered closed,\u201d she said. \u201cOur society must continue to operate \u2013 but in an extremely limited way,\u201d she said. President Trump outlined Monday an executive order he signed that will prohibit hoarding of medical equipment and supplies used for treating and preventing coronavirus. The order will \u201cprohibit the\u00a0hoarding of vital medical\u00a0equipment and supplies, such as\u00a0hand sanitizers, face masks, and\u00a0personal protective equipment,\" he said at the coronavirus task force briefing. The executive order is also meant at preventing price gouging on critical health and medical resources. Trump said that the Health and Human Services Department will designate certain items as \u201cscarce\u201d and it will be a crime to stockpile those items. \"Very simply, we'll not allow\u00a0anyone to exploit the suffering\u00a0of American citizens for their\u00a0own profit,\u201d Trump said. Attorney General William Barr said the Department of Justice has seen some evidence of hoarding and price gouging on health and medical resources that were authorized under the Defense Production Act.\u00a0 Barr said the new executive order provides, \u201cthe\u00a0authority to address, if it\u00a0becomes necessary, hoarding that\u00a0threatens the supply of those\u00a0necessary health and medical\u00a0resources.\u201d He also said this won't affect Americans who have stocked on toilet paper and other necessities. \"I want to stress that we're not\u00a0talking about consumers or\u00a0businesses stockpiling supplies\u00a0for their own operations,\" he said at the briefing.\u00a0\"We're talking about people\u00a0hoarding these goods and\u00a0materials on an industrial scale\u00a0for the purpose of manipulating\u00a0the market and ultimately\u00a0deriving windfall profits.\u00a0If you have a big supply\u00a0of toilet paper in your house,\u00a0this is not something you have\u00a0to worry about.\" President Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is distributing millions of masks and that personal protective equipment for medical professionals is being shipped to what he described as \u201chotspots\u201d around the country. Trump said FEMA will distribute 8 million N95 masks, the type recommended for protection against coronavirus.\u00a0 He said 73 pallets of personal protective equipment will be shipped to New York, and 36 pallets will be sent to Washington state \u2013 two areas where Covid-19 has hit particularly hard.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re having millions and millions of masks made as we speak,\u201d Trump said at the coronavirus task force briefing. Trump said the badly-needed supplies will go to \u201cmedical hotspots\u201d around the country. Healthcare workers around the US have warned of looming supply shortages if the outbreak escalates. \u201cAcross the nation we are seeing an outpouring of creativity and innovative ideas,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe scientific community and members of the private sector are really working together.\u201d Watch here: ##Health## President Trump on Monday opened the coronavirus task force briefing by echoing his tweet on Asian Americans, a message that comes after days of casting coronavirus as \"China virus\" and \"Chinese virus.\" After consulting with medical experts, and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing. \"It\u2019s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They\u2019re amazing people. And the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape, or form. They\u2019re working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together, it\u2019s very important,\" he said, emphasizing the word \"Asian.\" Note that Trump used the words \"they\" and \"us\" when referring to Asian Americans.\u00a0 He also extended well wishes to a member of the White House press corps who is awaiting coronavirus test results.\u00a0 \"I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem. We appreciate you being here. This is getting to be more and more social distancing and that's fine, that's the way it should be...We extend our best wishes to the person affected,\" he said.\u00a0 Watch here: President Trump said Monday he hopes to reassess his instructions for people to stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. \"We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We're not going to let the cure be worse than the problem. At the end of the 15-day period,\u00a0we'll make a decision as to which way we want to go,\" he said during the daily coronavirus briefing.  Trump said he hopes the United States will soon be \"open for business.\" He added: \"And essentially, we're referring to the timing of the opening, essentially, the opening of our country. Because we have it pretty well shut-down in order to get rid of this invisible enemy.\" ##Daily Life## Arizona\u2019s National Guard is fighting coronavirus by filling grocery shelves. Gov. Doug Ducey said the state is employing them to help with the most immediate need \u2014 dealing with empty shelves for basic provisions.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be grocery store workers. They\u2019re going to close the gap in terms of what was missing,\" Ducey said. The governor said with the Guard helping to direct distribution, each store can be fully stocked, and stores can stay supplied as long as people spread out their shopping trips. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go shopping, buy a week\u2019s worth of groceries once a week. If you\u2019ll do that, you\u2019ll come back the next week, and the shelves will be full,\" Ducey said. He said once store supplies stabilize, the Guard can be used for other purposes, such as helping hospitals with supplies and facilities. ##Daily Life## State health officials reported more than 100 coronavirus-related deaths in a single day for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak, according to CNN Health's Tally.\u00a0 This brings to the total deaths nationwide in the United States to 520, with the state of New York having the most deaths in a single state with 157. ##Health## Oregon Gov.

Ron DeSantis said Monday he is issuing an executive order that calls for a mandatory 14-day self-isolation for travelers coming from airports in New York and New Jersey. \u201cToday there\u2019s over 190 direct flights from the New York City area to the state of Florida, and I would reckon, given the outbreak there, that every single flight has somebody on it who\u2019s positive for Covid-19,\u201d DeSantis said at a news conference. There are at least 1,171 cases of coronavirus and 13 deaths in Florida, according to CNN Health\u2019s tally of US cases. DeSantis said travelers will be met by local or state law enforcement, as well as personnel from the Florida Department of Health. Passengers will also be subject to temperature checks, DeSantis said. Passengers planning to stay with family in Florida would not be exempt from the order. DeSantis said the order \u201cwill go out today.\" The governor said he believes New York State\u2019s shelter-in-place order may have contributed a surge in visitors to his state.  \u201cAs soon as that shelter-in-place order came down from the New York governor, man, the flights took off and people just got the heck out of Dodge,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe\u2019re just ending up having to deal with this.\u201d ##Health## ##Travel## Georgia\u2019s bars and nightclubs will shut down beginning noon Tuesday until April 6, according to the governor's executive order. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also prohibited as part of the order as well as a \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d for all elderly residents and those with compromised immune systems. ##Daily Life## Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking from his home in Ottawa on Monday, had a message for Canadians who choose to ignore social distancing advice: \"Enough is enough. Go home and stay home.\"\u00a0 Trudeau reiterated the need for self-distancing, saying, \"If you choose to ignore that advice, if you choose to get together with people or go to crowded places, you are not just putting yourself at risk, you are putting others at risk too.\" He went on to warn Canadians, saying, \"We are going to make sure this happens. Whether by educating people more on the risks or by enforcing the rules if that is needed. Nothing that could help is off the table.\" There are at least 1,432 cases of coronavirus and 20 deaths in Canada.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Daily Life## Pennsylvania Gov.

All beach parking lots are also being closed, Barger said. Parks and Recreation facilities in Los Angeles have been closed since Thursday. Barger encouraged people to walk around their neighborhoods, but warned residents to \"keep to the six-foot rule\" Health Director Barbara Ferrer said social distancing isn\u2019t just sometimes \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s all the time.\u201d ##Daily Life## Within the next \u201c72 hours or less,\u201d New York and Seattle should expect Army field hospitals to arrive in their cities by truck and start setting up, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen.

Several mobile military medical facilities are on \u201cprepare to deploy\u201d orders, but these two are expected to be among the first to go. ##Health## Boris Johnson has just imposed the most stringent social restrictions\u00a0on the British public since the end of the World War II. With immediate effect, the public is being instructed by the prime minister to stay at home. The only exceptions are:\u00a0shopping for basic necessities; one form of exercise a day; any medical need; and, for the designated key workers, traveling to and from work. If they don't follow the rules, police will have the power to enforce the rules by dispersing gatherings and fines.\u00a0 The move comes after weeks of criticism that the Johnson has not taken the coronavirus outbreak seriously enough, as Britain's European counterparts had moved faster and harder. In fact, even after this latest announcement, the UK's response is still behind countries like Germany, France and Italy.\u00a0 What's taken him so long? Johnson is not naturally comfortable with removing anyone's personal liberties. Throughout his career, Johnson has been disparaging about ideas of the \"nanny state\" and disdainful of the political instincts of those who use the state to tell the public what to do. In a 2004 newspaper column, Johnson wrote of a proposed smoking ban: \"We should have the common sense to listen to others before we presume to act in their interests.\" Mocking those who were in favor of the ban, he wrote: \"Next thing, I said, you'll be wanting to ban drink in order to remove any temptation to get drunk, or ban cars, to avoid ever being tempted to drive too fast\u2026\"\u00a0 Johnson's reluctance to tell others what to do goes beyond gags about drinks. In the same column, he made reference to the Iraq war \u2014 and attacked the government of the time (now the opposition Labour party) who \"decided, from a position of such ignorance, that the best way to help Iraq was to kill so many of its people.\" This stuff runs deep for Johnson. He has spent decades honing his image as a liberal Conservative who believes people should be free to live their lives how they wish. It is a seam which has run through his entire professional career: from editing magazines to running the official Brexit campaign. Johnson has for years defined his political views as driven by personal liberty.\u00a0 It might go some way to explaining why the new rules might be a little less drastic than they initially sound. Yes, the police can break up gatherings of people and impose fines, but no mention of detention (which would be defensible under human rights law). And the rules will be reviewed in three weeks, the prime minister's advisers were keen to remind journalists.\u00a0 Yes, these measures are a big deal for the UK, as it slowly comes to terms with how serious this crisis really is. But Johnson will hope that the message towards the end of his address,\u00a0\"no Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this,\" will have reached the audience at home. And his team will be crossing their fingers that whenever these measures are lifted, it's remembered that this was done with the heaviest of hearts.\u00a0 South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster announced Monday the signing of an executive order in the state that would allow law enforcement officers to prohibit and disperse gatherings of three or more people if they feel the gathering is a threat to public health. Police \u201cwould know it when they see it,\u201d he said of such gatherings. The order would not apply to businesses or workplaces, McMaster said.\u00a0 At least five people have died of coronavirus in South Carolina, according to the Department of Health. ##Daily Life## ##Health## \u00a0 The British Prime Minister has ordered the UK to lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.\u00a0 Calling the virus the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d the UK has faced in decades, Boris Johnson said people across the country must \u201cstay home\u201d in order to halt the growth of Covid-19 and protect the health care system.\u00a0 \u201cWithout a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won\u2019t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,\u201d Johnson said in a televised address.\u00a0 People will be allowed to leave their homes for limited purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible\nOne form of exercise a day \u2014 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2014 alone or with members of your household\nAny medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person\nTraveling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.\u00a0 \u201cIf you don\u2019t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings,\u201d he said. The measures will be in place for three weeks and then will be reviewed. Watch here: ##Daily Life## John Roberts was the only US Supreme Court justice present\u00a0in the conference room last Friday as the justices \u201cmet\u201d for their regular meeting to discuss pending cases.  The other eight justices participated via a teleconference, said Kathy Arberg, the Court's public information officer. It was Roberts\u2019 idea \u201cin accordance with the Center of Disease Control\u2019s guidance on social distancing\" for the other justices to work from home, Arberg said. It\u2019s likely that when the justices meet again next Friday, they will continue the same pattern. The news comes as the Court is making changes to grapple with the pandemic.  On Monday, for the first time in a decade, the court released opinions\u00a0for an argued\u00a0case\u00a0without sitting on the bench. They also postponed oral arguments for the next two weeks \u2014 something the court has not done since 1918. ##Daily Life## President Trump has signed an executive order \u201cto prevent hoarding & price gouging of supplies needed in our war against the\u00a0#Coronavirus,\u201d according to a tweet from\u00a0White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham.\u00a0 She included what appears to be a White House photo of the President flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Attorney General William Barr.\u00a0 Reporters were not told about the Oval Office signing prior to the tweet and have no way to independently verify the picture was taken at today's event.\u00a0 Texas\u00a0Attorney General\u00a0Ken Paxton said\u00a0Monday\u00a0that the governor's order to postpone \"all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary\" includes abortions\u00a0 Paxton\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement that\u00a0the ban applies to\u00a0\"all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary, including routine dermatological, ophthalmological, and dental procedures, as well as most scheduled healthcare procedures that are not immediately medically necessary such as orthopedic surgeries or any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\" The statement notes that \"failure to comply with an executive order issued by the governor related to the COVID-19 disaster can result in penalties of up to $1,000 or 180 days of jail time.\" ##Health## All the UEFA Club Finals, including the Champions League Final, have been postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The\u00a0White House's Covid-19 Task Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u00a0 plan to route those donated supplies and equipment to hospitals or other temporary medical facilities in need, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons announced on Saturday.  The announcement was made after the group last week had asked plastic surgeons to cease elective surgeries or any nonessential services due to increased risks. According to a statement from the group's president, Dr. Lynn Jeffers, the \"White House was in direct contact with ASPS leadership to expand the scope of our clearinghouse and potentially facilitate distribution of supplies and equipment nationwide by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\" \"Delineating the location of ventilators outside of hospitals is the first urgent need. Hospitals are already facing ventilator shortages and ventilator manufacturing will not meet this need in time,\" Jeffers said in the statement. \"This is urgent, and the need is now.\" ##Health## World Health Organization officials said that chloroquine, a drug typically used to treat malaria, will be one option included in a large, global clinical trial evaluating potential coronavirus treatment. \u201cThere\u2019s some indications that it could be useful but there are no clear-cut studies that have been rigorously done to either prove or disprove that chloroquine is effective,\u201d WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said during a call with reporters on Monday. This comes after the announcement President Trump made last week that the US Food and Drug Administration approved the \u201cvery powerful\u201d drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus and that there were \u201cvery, very encouraging early results.\u201d The FDA later tempered the President's remarks regarding chloroquine as an approved treatment, noting larger studies are needed to draw conclusions. Currently there are no treatments \u2014 including chloroquine \u2014that have proven safe and effective against Covid-19, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a separate press briefing on Monday. \u201cThere is a desperate need for effective therapeutics. There is currently no treatment that has been proven to be effective against Covid-19,\u201d Tedros said on Monday. WHO announced last week that it had organized the SOLIDARITY trial to examine potential treatment options for Covid-19 \u2014 chloroquine being one of them. \u201cWe understand that this situation is very complex. Everybody, including President Trump, is trying to identify treatments that could help their people. And I think everybody is interested in further exploring the potential of chloroquine, so we are,\u201d said Dr. Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo, a medical officer at WHO's Department of Immunization Vaccines and Biologicals. Even without clinical evidence, some patients with Covid-19 are already taking chloroquine, but there could be harm in that too, Swaminathan said. Over the weekend, three people in Nigeria overdosed on the drug, which can cause seizures, nausea, vomiting, deafness, vision changes and low blood pressure. \u201cWe have no knowledge that it\u2019s going to benefit anyone,\u201d Swaminathan said. \u201cIt is a really important point to focus our efforts on generating the evidence which could then be used to treat people properly and effectively.\u201d ##Health##\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence  there may be an opportunity to increase the current ventilator supply in American hospitals by converting devices used by anesthesiologists. Pence said his team told governors on a call today, \u201cthat when the President engaged leaders of a number of medical associations, we determined that the devices that are used by anesthesiologists could be easily converted to ventilators that could be used for people struggling with the coronavirus.\u201d\u00a0 Pence, who was speaking from Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters, said that the FDA has \u201cissued guidance on the changing of a vent in that piece of equipment.\u201d \u201cAnd so we directed all of our governors today to survey all of their outpatient clinics to identify what we believe are tens of thousands of these devices which could add to our nation\u2019s resources for ventilators for people that might be severely impacted by the coronavirus,\u201d Pence continued. Pence said the option received a \u201cstrong response\u201d from governors on the call.\u00a0 ##Health## The US Federal Housing Finance Agency is working to protect renters in multi-family properties during the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on the US economy.

They're flying planes into Central America, and they are prepared to bring folks back on those aircraft. So it's a variety of different US government aircraft,\u201d they said. The official said they are prioritizing space on the flights for those with vulnerabilities, such as age and medical conditions. \u201cIf we have somebody who is 70 years old with an underlying condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, that person is going to get a higher priority on one of those flights, than the hale and hearty 20 year old,\u201d they said.

This establishes a capacity of more than 1,000 patients by Tuesday and likely 2,000 by the end of the week, thereby relieving the burden on Chicago hospitals and allowing them to focus their critical beds on those patients that need acute care. Hotel operations staff will be properly trained for this situation and will not directly interact with quarantined guests \u2014 that will be the responsibility of public health employees, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a news conference on Monday. Lightfoot said she plans on working up an agreement with Metro South Medical Center in Blue Island, Illinois, to utilize its currently vacant hospital facility, which will open up an additional 200 rooms that will become available starting this Thursday.  The mayor said Chicago created its plan based on what worked in other countries to respond to immediate medical needs where it is necessary to isolate and quarantine individuals who are at risk to slow the spread of coronavirus. Three Chicago YMCA locations and other city-wide organizations are \"stepping up to support individuals experiencing homelessness\" by opening up their doors to the at risk homeless community in Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot said.

Esper said he looks at the use of military field hospitals as a way to bridge a gap in needs.\u00a0 \u201cHow I foresee our hospitals being used is during the early stages of the pandemic, the virus hitting a city where they\u2019re still trying to ramp up capability, bed space, we can come in for a short period of time, for a few weeks to provide that capacity until they get either gyms converted, hotels converted, college dorms converted, all those things that the Corps of Engineers is working on right now,\" he said. ##Health## Senate Democrats on Monday blocked advancing a coronavirus economic stimulus bill when a procedural vote failed to get to the 60 votes needed to pass. It was the second time in two days Democrats blocked the measure as talks over the giant bill continue. The vote tally was 49-46 with a largely party line vote. Sen. Doug Jones, a moderate Democrat who is up for re-election in Alabama, joined Republicans in voting for the bill. After the vote, Jones told CNN off camera that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the political games both sides are playing. Senate Democrats lined up against the measure \u2013 just as they did yesterday when the first attempted procedural vote failed \u2013 as they argue that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should not be holding what they have called \u201carbitrary\u201d votes while negotiators are still attempting to reach a bipartisan deal. The failed vote is sure to incense Republicans, who have been criticizing Democrats all morning and accusing them of holding up efforts to move the package forward, and ratchet up tensions as lawmakers continue to hold talks on a stimulus package.\u00a0 Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has advised all British travelers abroad to return now.

GE also announced that\u00a0David Joyce, CEO of\u00a0GE Aviation, will forgo half his salary starting on April 1. ##Business## Another week of self-isolating \u2014 or, for many Americans, mandatory lockdowns \u2014 will raise more questions for President Trump on how long the coronavirus mitigation measures will last and whether they are worth the economic pain. Aides say Trump is itching for the guidelines to be eased at the end of the 15 day period, but realistically there are few health experts who think that\u2019s enough time to know whether the measures he announced last week will suffice.\u00a0 The dynamic has led to a robust internal debate over how best to balance the actual health of the country \u2014 with potentially hundreds of thousands of lives at stake \u2014 with its economic health. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have continued to publicly suggest the measures announced by the White House last week were too stringent and have caused unnecessary economic pain. Many of his conservative allies circulated a Wall Street Journal editorial from last week, which questioned whether the shutdown was worth the trade off of a shuttered economy.  That has helped fuel growing opposition among some of Trump\u2019s advisers to an extended lockdown.\u00a0 Officials aren\u2019t sure where Trump will ultimately land after 15 days \u2014 and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, will continue to act as a critical voice behind the scenes.\u00a0 Trump was initially resistant to Fauci\u2019s recommendations that he take steps to encourage social distancing during the first go-around, people familiar with the deliberations said. The President remains unconvinced it was the fight decision. And there are people around him who aren\u2019t exactly reinforcing Fauci\u2019s message, including some of his economic advisers. An open question is whether Trump is willing to blow off Fauci once the economic picture becomes clearer. Meanwhile, Fauci has been vocal in his disagreements with Trump \u2014 Including interviews openly discussing his role in correcting the president\u2019s false or misleading statements.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## US stocks kicked off in the red on Monday, despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s significant new stimulus measures aimed at keeping the US economy functioning.

Professional football in the country had initially been postponed for two weeks in March with a view to resuming the domestic season on April 3.\u00a0 However a joint monitoring commission between the two bodies agreed to postpone all professional competitions until the Spanish government considered they could start again \u201cwithout creating any health risk.\u201d More context: On Monday, Spain\u2019s Health Ministry announced that the total number of cases registered in the country had risen to 33,089 \u2014 4,517 more than Sunday.

I spoke to the President last night. I know he is very pleased with the medical professionals and then some of these new drugs that have been approved. This legislation prepares us for what I would say, the 10 to 12 week period, but I hope we don\u2019t need to last that long. And for whatever reason, this turns out that it\u2019s gonna last longer, we will go back to Congress,\" he said.\u00a0 He outlined how the current legislation will provide liquidity for small businesses and said it needs to be passed \"ASAP.\" ##Business## Domestic commercial airlines in India will stop operations starting Wednesday, according to a press release from India\u2019s Civil Aviation Ministry. \u201cAirlines have to plan operations to land at their destination before 23:59 hours on 24/3/2020\u201d, the statement reads.

Sim\u00f3n said another \"uplifting number\" was the number of patients discharged \u2014 3,355 \u2014 which now represents 10% of all cases.\u00a0 He also gave some insight into the profile of those who have died from the virus: 87% were older than 70 years old, \"which was expected and goes in line with our country's normal mortality rate\".\u00a0 \"We know all groups can be affected, but the most affected one are the elderly with more than 70 years of age, which we expected\", he said. ##Health##\u00a0 New York City hospitals will only be able to get through \u201cthis week\u201d before they start getting \u201cto a point where people can\u2019t be saved,\u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day\u201d Monday morning. \u201cIn our public hospitals, our 11 public hospitals right now, this week, I can only guarantee you right now, John, that we can get through this week with the equipment and supplies we have. That's the blunt reality,\" de Blasio said. He added: \"If we don't get some relief quickly, and I can count, John, I literally want to see hundreds of ventilators, I want to see first hundreds of thousands and millions of masks, if that doesn't come in starting this week, we will get to a point where people can't be saved who could have been saved.\" More than 34,300 Americans have been infected\u00a0with coronavirus across all 50 states, and at least 414 people have died. Almost half all US cases \u2014 16,887 \u2014 are in New York state. It's shocking to have to say this. Even just a few days ago, I thought we could get safely into April. It's moving so fast right now, that I can't even say that anymore,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIf we don't get ventilators this week, we are going to start losing lives we could have saved. I can't be blunter than that,\" he said. Last week they mayor\u2019s office said New York City needs 45 million surgical gowns, coveralls, gloves, and face masks \u2013 known as personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 provided early in April to ensure its healthcare system can deal with coronavirus-related issues. Watch more: The Head of the Japan Olympic Committee said postponing this summer\u2019s Games should be considered, among other options, as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Yasuhiro Yamashita, said: \u201cFrom the athletes' point of view of safety and security, we have to come to a stage where we cannot help but consider things including postponement [\u2026] I would like to say once again it is not decided that the Olympics is not held in July.\u201d The International Olympic Committee announced yesterday that it had given itself a deadline of four weeks to make a decision on the Games. Yamashita, though, warned that too long a delay would be a burden to athletes given the possibility of having to qualify again for the Games. \u201cI think the postponing period shouldn't be long when we think about the athletes and the Olympic village,\u201d he said. His comments come after both Canada and Australia\u2019s National Olympic Committees said they would not send athletes to Tokyo this year because of the risks associated with the virus.\u00a0 The Japan Olympic Committee is scheduled to hold a board meeting in Tokyo on Friday to discuss the status of this summer\u2019s Games. ##Daily Life## Secretary of State Mike\u00a0Pompeo\u00a0released a statement\u00a0today slamming Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader  Ali Khamenei and the regime's handling of the coronavirus outbreak  Pompeo's statement\u00a0said Iran\u2019s \u201cfabrications\u201d are putting Iranian people and others around the world at \u201cgreater risk\u201d.\u00a0 Some background: On Sunday Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali\u00a0Khamenei\u00a0floated accusations against the US that they had created the coronavirus, questioning why people would trust the US with creating a cure for the virus.\u00a0He suggested that the US created the coronavirus to \"further antagonize\" the Iranian people.\u00a0\u00a0 Pompeo\u00a0said Iran did not take decisive action and are not being transparent about the number of cases and deaths resulting from the coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cThe Iranian regime ignored repeated warnings from its own health officials, and denied its first death from the coronavirus for at least nine days. The regime continues to lie to the Iranian people and the world about the number of cases and deaths, which are unfortunately far higher than the regime admits,\" Pompeo said in the statement. Pompeo\u00a0said Iran refused assistance from the United States to deal with the pandemic. \u201cKhamenei rejected this offer because he works tirelessly to concoct conspiracy theories and prioritizes ideology over the Iranian people,\u201d\u00a0Pompeo\u00a0said.

President Trump is sending retweets that seem to be encouraging an end to strong social distancing measures after the current 15-day period, despite concern from public health officials that it won't be long enough to blunt the worst of the coronavirus. \u201c15 days,\u201d one user tweeted. \u201cThen we isolate the high risk groups and the rest of us get back to work before it\u2019s all over for everyone!!\u00a0#Landslide2020\u201d\u00a0 \u201cFlatten the curve NOT the Economy,\u201d reads a follow up tweet. \u201cAfter 15 days are over the world can begin to heal!,\u201d another user tweeted.\u00a0 Yesterday, Trump tweeted this: On Monday he retweeted one user, responding to his original tweet, who wrote, \u201cCorrect. 15 days, then we keep the high risk groups protected as necessary and the rest of us go back to work.\u201d ##Daily Life## The British government is prepared to do more to force people to keep apart if necessary, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said Monday.

Enrique Ruiz Escudero, senior health official of Madrid's Regional Government, told radio COPE on Monday that the number of cases in the country is expected to begin decreasing by the end of this week. \"We believe this week we'll reach the famous \u2018peak\u2019 - in which we see new cases, but less than the day before,\" he said. Escudero explained the estimate is based on the correlation between the virus' maximum incubation period (14 days) and the beginning of isolation measures and school closures across the country.  Health workers test positive: Escudero also added that in Madrid, 600 health workers tested positive for Covid-19, and 1,400 others who were in direct contact with infected patients and are in preventive home isolation. Nursing homes infected: Around 20% of all nursing homes in the Spanish capital of Madrid have registered cases of Covid-19, Ignacio Aguado, the Vice President of Madrid's regional government told radio \"Onda Cero\" Monday. \"The problem is that the people who live there are very vulnerable: our elderly.

Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute, the national agency for disease control and prevention said the average age of those deceased is 82 years old. 57% of the deceased are men and 43% are women. As Germany's cases continue to rise, Wieler once again pleaded for citizens to practice social distancing. \u201cPlease keep a distance of at least 1.5 to 2 meters, please stick to the hygienic rules, wash your hands and sneeze into your elbow,\" Wieler said.  \"In Germany we have a lot of test capacity, in comparison to other countries,\" he said. \"Our test capacity is increasing all the time, the tests itself are there, but we have to test with a target.\u201d Health officials in Nigeria have issued a warning over chloroquine after they said three people in the country overdosed on the drug, in the wake of President Trump's comments about using it to treat coronavirus. A Lagos state official told CNN that three people were hospitalized in the city after taking the drug. Officials later issued a statement cautioning against using chloroquine for Covid-19 treatment. Drug not approved: President Donald Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0at a White House briefing last week that the Food and Drug Administration had approved the \"very powerful\" drug chloroquine to treat\u00a0coronavirus. The FDA after the briefing\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying it had not approved the drug for use against Covid-19 and is still studying its effectiveness against the disease. Price hikes: After Trump's comments, there was a surge of interest among people in Lagos keen to stock up on the medication, which has led to price hikes in the megacity of around 20 million inhabitants.\u00a0 One man told CNN that in a pharmacy near his home on the Lagos mainland, he witnessed the price rise by more than 400% in a matter of minutes. No evidence: The Lagos State Health Ministry\u00a0issued a brief statement\u00a0saying there was no \"hard evidence that chloroquine is effective in prevention or management of coronavirus infection.\" What is it used for? Chloroquine is\u00a0used\u00a0to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

A failed\u00a0Senate vote on a mammoth stimulus bill\u00a0amid acrimony between Republicans and Democrats came as the virus trimmed the GOP majority with five members quarantined. State and local leaders and front-line health workers meanwhile pleaded with\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0to rush lifesaving medical gear to them and their patients as US infections topped 32,000. Trump responded, announcing the dispatch of large quantities\u00a0of medical equipment to hard-hit states, and showed signs of settling into his role in offering compassion to a fearful nation -- before digressing into his normal political grudges. A dark and disorientating weekend that stretched federal and local governments, the economy and the health care system to a breaking point, served to clarify the mind-numbing scale of the worst domestic crisis to hit the nation since World War II. It ended with deeply ominous questions about the economy -- which appears to be tumbling into the abyss, and with fresh doubts over the President's capacity to lead and reassure the nation.

Gavin Newsom issued a shelter in place order\u00a0directing the state's nearly 40 million residents to stay home beginning March 20 to help stop the spread of\u00a0coronavirus. Instead, many public spaces were packed, prompting officials in some cities to order parks, recreation areas and beaches to close. In response to the crowds, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced on Twitter late Sunday that he was closing sports and recreation at all LA City Parks. He said people should heed the closures and stay home.  \"This weekend we saw too many people packing beaches, trails and parks,\" the mayor tweeted. \"That doesn't mean gather elsewhere. This is serious. Stay home and save lives.\" California is one of eight US states that have issued stay at home orders. Several countries around the world have also put in place similar measures.

The main markets have all opened around 3% to 4% lower, with the German Dax and the French CAC 40 both down sharply.  The falls follow on from losses in Asia, and a big drop in US futures. Dow futures fell 5%, while the Australian benchmark -- the S&P/ASX 200 -- closed 5.6% lower. Chinese and Korean markets were also down.  ##Business## Most non-residents will be banned from entering Hong Kong from midnight Wednesday local time, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced at a news conference on Monday. Non-Hong Kong residents arriving from Macao, Taiwan and mainland China will be allowed to enter Hong Kong as long as they haven't travelled abroad for the last 14 days. Travelers from Macao and Taiwan who enter Hong Kong will be subjected to mandatory 14-day quarantine \u2013 which is already in place for most travelers, including those from mainland China. Travelers will also not be allowed to transit through Hong Kong airport. The strict new measures come as the number of confirmed cases in the city has almost doubled in the past week. Many of the cases were imported from overseas, as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad, or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- returned,\u00a0bringing the virus back with them. Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that most travelers to Hong Kong will be banned from entering the territory from midnight on Wednesday and give more information on the ban. ##Travel## The US is impeding the global fight against coronavirus with its sanctions on Iran, the country\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a\u00a0tweet on Monday.\u00a0 \u201cIranian people appreciate the growing global campaign of government & civil society leaders calling for lifting of illegal US sanctions,\u201d he said, adding that the US was \u201cNOT listening\u201d and the only remedy was to \u201cDEFY US mass punishment.\u201d President weighs in: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on state TV that the US was responsible for \u201cshortage of medicines and foodstuffs,\u201d blaming American sanctions for hampering Iran\u2019s efforts to contain the outbreak.\u00a0 Won't accept US aid: Rouhani said Iran will not accept US aid to combat the virus and said the US should lift sanctions on Iran if it wants to help contain the outbreak. \u201cThe fact that Americans say that we are ready to assist Iran under coronavirus crisis is one of the biggest lies in history,\u201d Rouhani said, adding, \u201cOur nation knows what to do. Our medical staff have good command of their jobs.\u201d Rouhani and Zarif\u2019s remarks come a day after Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the US of creating the virus. The elderly are among the most vulnerable members of society -- and because of that, nursing homes have had to restrict visits during the coronavirus pandemic. Without family visits to look forward to, nursing homes have had to come up with new ways to keep residents occupied.  At the Bryn Celyn Care Home in Wales, United Kingdom, residents have been playing a life-size version of the board game \"Hungry Hungry Hippos.\" This new version swaps crocodiles for boxes that residents slide across the floor to trap colorful balls. Watch the full video here Millions of people across India have been placed under lockdown until the end of the month as efforts to\u00a0halt the spread\u00a0of the\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0in the country intensify.\u00a0 Residents living in 75 districts across the country, including in major cities such as the capital New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata have been placed under travel, work and\u00a0movement restrictions\u00a0until March 31.\u00a0 India -- the world's second most populous country -- has 415 cases of the coronavirus, including seven deaths, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A sudden rise in cases has led to growing concerns over the country's capacity to test for the virus and that a major outbreak on the scale seen in Europe -- the pandemic's new epicenter -- will spread in the country. Who is affected by the measures: In New Delhi, public transportation, including the metro and rickshaws, has been suspended, all shops, factories, places of worship and offices have been\u00a0shut, interstate travel has stopped, borders with neighboring states have closed and people are required to stay in their homes until March 31.\u00a0 Exempt from the order are essential services such as grocery stores, hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations, telecoms and postal services, and restaurants that deliver food. Testing capacity: Dr. Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said that India has conducted 5,000 tests in the past week and a total of 15,000 so far. There are 111 labs operational with a per week testing capacity of 60,000 to 70,000 and around 60 more private labs are in the process of being approved to further increase testing capacity, according to Bhargava. Other steps: Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Telangana have all initiated state-wide lockdowns versus targeted restrictions of cities and districts. Several districts, including the financial capital of Mumbai, have banned gatherings of four or more people, and officials can take legal action against those who violate the rule. Read more here.  Musician Neil Diamond reached out on Twitter Sunday to give folks a little hope during these tense times. \"I know we're going through a rough time right now but I love ya,\" the singer said in a video tweeted from his account. \"I think maybe if we sing together, well, we'll just feel a little bit better.\" He sang an acoustic version of his famous hit \"Sweet Caroline\" with new lyrics that some would call guidelines for social distancing. \"Hands ... washing hands,\" he crooned while strumming a guitar. \"Reaching out ... don't touch me, I won't touch you!\" Watch the uplifting clip here:  ##Health## States around Australia have brought in strict new measures to control the spread of coronavirus. Currently, the country has at least 1,098 cases and seven deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Here's how the country is handling the outbreak. Shutting non-essential services: At midday Monday, businesses across Australia followed the government\u2019s orders to shut down bars, restaurants, gyms, places of worship and other venues where people traditionally congregate. Domestic travel discouraged: South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory are among those to require anyone arriving into the state to self-isolate for 14 days. South Australia's Premier Steven Marshall described the move as a decision to \"close the border.\" Despite that, travelers are still able to enter the state. Olympics in doubt: Australia's Olympic Committee is telling its athletes to prepare for the possibility that the Games could be postponed until 2021. In a statement Monday, the committee said its Executive Board had unanimously agreed that an Australian team \"could not be assembled in the changing circumstances at home and abroad.\" \"Toughest year of our lives\": Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called on Australians to stand up to the \u201cunprecedented challenge\u201d of the global health crisis. \"Life is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change,\" he said. \"For many young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives.\" ##Daily Life## Shortly after dawn, Hideki Sugiura moves swiftly through the narrow aisles of Tokyo's\u00a0Toyosu Market. It's much quieter than usual, and the sushi chef doesn't need to buy as much fish for his small restaurant, Sushi Marubatsu. Business is down around 50%, Sugiura says, due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The virus has spread through large parts of Asia and is now gripping Europe and the US, with more than 300,000 cases globally. Japan currently has more than 1,000 confirmed cases, several dozen of whom have died. Nearly every day for the past nine years, Sugiura has been carrying out his daily ritual at Toyosu -- the wholesale section of the famous Tsukiji fish market, which\u00a0moved to new premises in 2018. His tiny restaurant, which fits about a dozen diners, is in\u00a0Shibuya, near Tokyo's famous intersection with a four-way pedestrian crossing. But the majority of his business comes from local Japanese. \"Company workers who used to come in for lunch don't come at all now,\" he says. \"And housewives used to come in at lunchtime, but none of them come now.\" Business already down: Sugiura says that business was already hurting before the virus spread, due to an ailing economy that slowed after the Japanese government increased the consumption tax in October. \"We've had a de facto shutdown of all the major engines of demand,\" says\u00a0Jesper Koll, a Tokyo-based economist. \"That's consumption, business spending, export of goods and inbound tourism.\" Many businesses had been holding out for the expected economic boost of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, due to be held in July and August this year. But now, the future of the event -- and the associated benefits for Tokyo's retail and tourism industry -- looks uncertain due to the pandemic. Read the whole story here.   American vodka company Tito's Vodka says it plans to use its distillery for something a little different: Hand sanitizer. \"While we advise that you cannot use our standard vodka product as a hand santizier, our team at the distillery has been working hard to get all of the pieces in place to begin production on a hand sanitizer that adheres to industry and governmental guidance,\" the company said in a statement.  \"While we don't have all of the details quite yet, we do know we will be giving it away for free to our community and those most in need.\" They're not the first company to switch gear. Earlier this month, luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, the parent company of Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy, said it would help French health authorities by manufacturing hand sanitizer and providing it to them for free. LVMH said it would use all the production facilities of its perfumes and cosmetics brands to produce large quantities of hydroalcoholic gel, or hand sanitizer. Only a week ago, Hong Kong\u00a0seemed like a model for how to contain the novel coronavirus, with a relatively small number of cases despite months of being on the\u00a0front lines of the outbreak.\u00a0 That was in large part thanks to action taken early on, while cases were spreading across mainland China, to implement measures that are now familiar throughout the world: virus mapping, social distancing, intensive hand-washing, and wearing masks and other protective clothing.\u00a0 Hong Kong was proof that these measures worked, with the city of 7.5 million only reporting some 150 cases at the start of March, even as the number of infections spiked in other East Asian territories like South Korea and Japan, and spread rapidly across Europe and North America.\u00a0 Increase in cases: Now, however, Hong Kong is providing a very different object lesson -- what happens when you let your guard down too soon. The number of confirmed cases has almost doubled in the past week, with many imported from overseas, as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad, or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- return,\u00a0bringing the virus back with them.\u00a0 This is a pattern playing out across parts of Asia -- mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan -- that were among the first to tackle the outbreak. All are now introducing new measures as a renewed wave of cases begins to crest.\u00a0 In it for the long haul: Compared to major cities in the West, like London or New York, residents in Hong Kong can sometimes feel as if they're living in the future. Many of the measures enacted in the Asian metropolis back in February are now being rolled out in European and American cities.\u00a0 But this latest lesson may be a bitter pill to swallow, as it indicates that quarantines and social distancing must continue well beyond the initial wave of cases, if another round of infections is to be avoided.\u00a0 For those just going into lockdown, that could mean they're in for the long haul. Read the full story here. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Monday that \u201c2020 will be the toughest year of our lives,\u201d as the country rolled out new, tougher measures to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking in Parliament, Morrison called on Australians to stand up to the \u201cunprecedented challenge\u201d of the global health crisis. At midday Monday, businesses across Australia followed the government\u2019s orders to shut down bars, restaurants, gyms, places of worship and other venues where people traditionally congregate. \u201cLife is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives.\u201d Morrison\u2019s remarks came as long queues were seen outside Centrelink offices around the country, where people were lined up to apply for social services payouts. \u201cAs Australia works to flatten the curve and slow this virus, we also face an immense economic challenge\u2026this is the biggest economic shock our nation has faced in generations,\u201d Morrison said. The Australian government website where residents sign up for benefits and jobseekers\u2019 allowance crashed Monday, Government Services Minister Stuart Roberts said. Roberts said a distributed denial of service (DDOS) alarm was triggered on the MyGov site when 95,000 users logged on at the same time just after 9 a.m., Monday morning. The system was built for 55,000 concurrent users, he said, adding that the government is examining ways to expand the system\u2019s capacity. A statement from the Australian Cyber Security Centre said the government is currently investigating the outage but has no evidence to suggest it was caused by malicious cyber activity. As of Monday, Australia reported 1,479 confirmed cases and seven deaths from the novel coronavirus, according to the country's Department of Health. ##Daily Life## The numbers: At least 339,000 people have contracted the novel coronavirus and over 14,700 have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases recorded by the World Health Organization and additional sources. Olympic dreams hang by a thread: For the first time Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe acknowledged that Tokyo 2020 may have to be postponed. Canada has already said it won't send a team even if the Games go ahead this year as planned.  Stock markets take a hit: Dow futures fell 5%, while the Australian benchmark -- the S&P/ASX 200 -- plunged more than 7% to an eight-year low when markets opened Monday morning. Chinese and Korean markets were also down.  Indian cities go into lockdown: The capital New Delhi is among 75 districts in the country that will go into lockdown until March 31 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Several districts are now enforcing a pre-existing law that makes it a punishable offence for four or more people to gather. New Zealand issues highest-level alert: All non-essential businesses across the country will close, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. The Pacific nation already limited international arrivals amid fears of imported cases.  US relief bill delayed: A key Senate vote related to a massive economic stimulus plan in response to the coronavirus pandemic has been pushed back as lawmakers continue to wrangle over its contents.  Japan reported five deaths due to the novel coronavirus on Sunday, its biggest one-day surge.  That takes the national toll to 49 deaths, the health ministry announced on Monday. The ministry also reported 42 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Sunday, taking the national tally of confirmed cases to 1,801. Of that total, 712 are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. ##Health## The Indian capital New Delhi is among 75 districts in the country that will go into lockdown until March 31 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The measures extend an initial 14-hour lockdown, which came into effect on Sunday. They  also include major cities, such as Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata, which means millions of workers in the technology and financial sectors will be forced to work from home for the rest of the month. Only essential services will be operational in these districts,\u00a0according to the official Press Information Bureau of India.\u00a0 All shops, commercial establishments, factories, workshops, offices, markets and places of worship will be closed, and interstate buses and metros will be suspended. Several districts -- including the financial capital of Mumbai -- are now enforcing a pre-existing law that makes it a punishable offence for four or more people to gather. Several states have gone into complete lockdown.  In the northern state of Punjab, the chief minister\u00a0announced\u00a0that except for essential services, the entire state will be under a lockdown until March 31. The state has confirmed more than 20 coronavirus cases, including one death.  The entire state of Uttarakhand -- which has only reported three confirmed cases --\u00a0announced\u00a0a non-essential services lockdown until March 31. \"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,\" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal\u00a0said in a tweet. India has reported 341 infections and five deaths from the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. ##Daily Life## The United Arab Emirates is closing all commercial centers and shopping malls along with fish, meat and vegetable markets. The new rule will come into force in 48 hours, and will be in place for two weeks -- but could be renewed, UAE authorities announced. The UAE currently has at least 150 coronavirus cases. ##Daily Life## More than 154 million children in Latin America and the Caribbean are temporarily out of school due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to the United Nations International Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). That's about 95% of all kids who are enrolled. Over the next few days and weeks, about 90% of early childhood centers, pre-primary, primary and secondary schools in the regions will be closed, according to the report. And that percentage is quickly growing, UNICEF said.\u00a0 \u201cThis situation, which could last longer than initially planned, increases the risk of permanent drop out, especially for the most vulnerable children,\u201d UNICEF\u2019s statement reads. According to Bernt Aasen, UNICEF\u2019s Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, this is an \"unprecedented educational crisis in the recent history of Latin America and the Caribbean.\" \"Never have so many schools been closed at the same time. The expansion of the coronavirus Covid-19 will leave most boys and girls out of school in the coming weeks.\n\"If school closure is further extended, there is a great risk that children fall behind in their learning and we fear that the most vulnerable students will never return to school. It is vital that they do not stop learning from home.\u201d Children in many countries around the world have also been told to stay home, potentially putting their education and psychological well-being at risk.

It said the employee, who is not being further identified, is currently in quarantine. Here's what else the Secret Service said: \u201cThe Secret Service has conducted a comprehensive contact trace assessment and determined that\u00a0the employee has not had contact with any Secret Service employee or protectee for nearly three weeks,\u201d the agency said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Secret Service is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, its protectees, and the public. Accordingly, the agency continues to follow all guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and continues to communicate those updates to the workforce.\u201d\u00a0 ##Health## A key Senate vote related to a massive economic stimulus plan in response to the coronavirus pandemic is being pushed back about three hours as Democrats and Republicans jockey for advantage in the talks over the bill.\u00a0 This is because Democrats are blocking the GOP\u2019s ability to come into session before noon, which is something that requires the Democrats\u2019 consent and is usually given without question.\u00a0 In this case, Democrats don\u2019t want to be forced to take the procedural vote Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wanted to take at 9:45 a.m. E.T. They want the talks on the stimulus bill to continue without that deadline, which they have called artificial.\u00a0 McConnell blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s move as reckless. He warned the stock markets will now be open for three hours before they can get some certainty that a stimulus bill will pass the Senate.\u00a0 Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who had several meetings with Schumer throughout Sunday as the various sides try to hammer out an agreement,\u00a0is expected back on Capitol Hill Monday morning.\u00a0 Then the Senate will come in at noon. There could be leader remarks from McConnell and Schumer.\u00a0Around 1 p.m. E.T.,  the Senate will then cast votes on three procedural motions, the third of which is the one in question. That said, if they actually cut a bipartisan deal before these votes are scheduled, they will likely toss these procedural votes aside and move directly to the bill.\u00a0\u00a0 What the bill aims to deliver: The\u00a0emergency economic aid proposal\u00a0could be worth over $2 trillion, according to Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump. It would include direct payments to Americans under a certain income threshold, $200 billion in loans to airlines and distressed industry sectors and $300 billion in forgivable bridge loans for small businesses. The proposal, a draft of which was obtained by CNN, underscores the scale of the economic crisis facing individuals and businesses across the country amid the accelerating pandemic and bolsters health care resources,\u00a0student loans\u00a0and aid, business tax provisions and temporary authority.

The patient -- who is an inmate at California State Prison, Los Angeles County -- is in stable condition and is being treated on site, according to a news release from the California Department of Corrections.\u00a0 He has been in isolation since March 19, after telling staff he wasn't feeling well. He was tested the next day, and received his positive test result on March 22.  Movement has been restricted at the institution while authorities investigate his contacts, and those deemed at-risk will be quarantined.  California's outbreak: California is one of the worst affected states in the US, with at least 1,468 confirmed cases and 32 deaths. California is also one of eight states to issue a stay at home order.  Issues in prisons: Other countries have struggled to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and prisons. At least 23 inmates are dead, and 87 injured following nationwide prison riots in Colombia prompted\u00a0by coronavirus infection fears. At least 11\u00a0prisoners died in coronavirus-related\u00a0riots in Italian\u00a0prisons. In Iran, 85,000\u00a0prisoners were temporarily sent home to curb the spread of the coronavirus. America's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has described the challenges of working with the Trump administration during the coronavirus pandemic. Asked how he responds to falsehoods from the President during news conferences, Fauci said, \u201cI can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down.\" \u201cOK, he said it. Let's try and get it corrected for the next time,\u201d Fauci said, according to an interview published by the journal\u00a0Science. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci has advised\u00a0six presidents\u00a0and has played a central role in the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force. \u201cI\u2019m sort of exhausted,\u201d Fauci said in the interview. \u201cBut other than that, I'm good. I mean, I'm not, to my knowledge, coronavirus infected. To my knowledge, I haven't been fired.\u201d Fauci said he and the President \u201cdisagree on some things.\u201d But he described Trump as responsive, saying: \u201cHe goes his own way. He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.\u201d Virus timeline: Fauci was asked about some of Trump\u2019s comments, including his assertion that China should have told US officials about the coronavirus three months sooner. That would have been around September, and there is no evidence Chinese officials were aware of the virus at that time. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t comport with facts,\u201d said Jon Cohen, the interviewer. \u201cI know, but what do you want me to do?\u201d Fauci replied. \u201cI mean, seriously Jon, let\u2019s get real. What do you want me to do?\u201d Terminology: Fauci also said he had never used the term \u201cChina virus.\u201d Asked if he ever would, Fauci responded, \u201cNo.\u201d ##Health## The Haitian government has granted permission to private airline company Eastern Airlines to fly United States citizens out of Haiti, according to a\u00a0statement from the US Embassy in Haiti\u00a0on Sunday. Passengers will have to book the direct charter commercial flights themselves, the statement read. \u201cThe US Embassy in Haiti is working closely with the State Department Repatriation Task Force to assist U.S. citizens who wish to depart Haiti, while observing the Haitian Government\u2019s measures to contain the spread of COVID-19,\u201d it said. What's going on in Haiti: On Thursday, Haitian President Jovenel Moise announced that Haiti is in full lockdown after announcing the country\u2019s first two coronavirus cases. One of the\u00a0infected people is a 60-year-old\u00a0Belgian\u00a0man who traveled to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0from Europe recently. He runs an orphanage in\u00a0Haiti.\u00a0The other is a French citizen. Actor Tom Hanks says he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, are feeling better after testing positive for coronavirus. In a tweet, Hanks posted an update, and offered some advice on what sheltering in place means.  \"Sheltering in place works like this: You don\u2019t give it to anyone -- you don\u2019t get it from anyone,\" he said. Earlier this month, Hanks said he and his wife were traveling in Australia when they were tested after exhibiting symptoms like tiredness, body aches, chills and \"slight fevers.\" Warner Bros. confirmed the actor was in Australia doing pre-production work on a film about singer Elvis Presley. ##Daily Life##  ##Health## New Zealand will issue its highest alert level and close all non-essential businesses across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a news briefing on Monday. The highest alert, level 4, will be issued in 48 hours amid the worsening outbreak, she said. New Zealand has 102 confirmed coronavirus cases and no deaths.  All\u00a0non-essential businesses, such as bars, gyms, and cinemas, will be required to close. All schools will be closed from Tuesday, while\u00a0supermarkets and service stations will remain open, she added. She said the new measures will \"place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders' movements in modern history,\" but said it would be necessary to protect lives after the country recorded local transmission of the coronavirus. \"We now consider that there is transmission within our communities,\" she said. \"This is not a decision taken lightly. But this is our best chance to slow the virus and to save lives.\" According to the New Zealand government, the Alert Level 4 means\u00a0there is\u00a0a \"widespread outbreak\" and \"sustained and intensive transmission\" across the country. Here's what else she had to say: \"I also said we should all be prepared to move quickly. Now is the time to put our plans into action. We are fortunate to still be some way behind the majority of overseas countries in terms of cases, but the trajectory is clear. Act now, or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere. We currently have 102 cases. But so did Italy once. Now the virus has overwhelmed their health system and hundreds of people are dying every day. The situation here is moving at pace, and so must we.\" ##Daily Life## ##Business## Asian markets and United States stock futures fell during Asian trading hours as a massive stimulus package to help Americans handle the coronavirus pandemic hit a major stumbling block.\u00a0 Here's how the markets performed in the US: Dow\u00a0futures fell more than 900\u00a0points, hitting a 5% decline that triggered a maximum allowable limit, or \"limit down.\" That halted futures from falling further.\nS&P 500\u00a0and\u00a0Nasdaq\u00a0futures also fell around 5%, and were last sitting at 4.8% down and 4.4% lower, respectively.

Read more about the markets here: ##Business## The coronavirus pandemic is throwing doubt over whether this year's Summer Olympics in Tokyo will still go ahead. Canada has become the first country to announce it won't send athletes to the Games. And, for the first time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the 2020 Summer Olympics is a possibility. The Olympics are still months away -- they're scheduled to start on July 24. But as Team Canada said in a statement, it's not just about athletes' health -- it's about public health. Has this ever happened before? The short answer is: Yes. The 1916 Summer Olympics were canceled amid World War I, and both the Summer Olympics of 1940 and 1944 were axed due to World War II. But scrapping an Olympics in peacetime would be unprecedented. Who would be impacted by this? Doing so would have ramifications on everything and everyone from the sponsors and broadcasters to the economy and athletes. Organizers said in December that the cost of hosting the Olympics was 1.35 trillion yen ($12.25 billion) -- and,\u00a0according\u00a0to Reuters, that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat, a\u00a0decision taken in\u00a0October 2019.\u00a0 Massive investments had been made in improving Japan's transportation networks, building venues and upgrading tourism facilities in anticipation of the 90 million visitors that Abe said Japan would welcome in 2020.
