Find all of our coronavirus-related coverage here, and let us know your thoughts here. If you've been lucky enough to essentially lock yourself indoors for the foreseeable future, you know that it can add a slew of new challenges to your everyday life. A trip to the grocery store is now potentially dangerous, so some have learned to depend on meal delivery services. Parties and excursions have been forced into the virtual world. And with schools closing, keeping kids entertained is quite a trial. Then there is the issue that some people have found themselves looking for something fun to do. We get it: Fighting boredom and finding new and engaging things to do every day can be tough. Trying out new hobbies, solving puzzles or pouring all your time and attention into your pet are solid options, but if you're looking for something to get the whole family involved, or something you can do with your friends over a video chat, there's always a classic board game.  Board games are often fun and lighthearted, making them an ideal escape. Plus, depending on the game, you can play them with anyone in the world. \"Games are so good for our mental health,\" says Lauren Bilanko, co-owner of the New York game shop Twenty Sided Store. \"They relieve stress and stimulate the imagination. They allow us to connect with others, to laugh and have fun, and pass the time in a positive way.\" If you're looking for games to play during quarantine, Bilanko says there are plenty that you can play alone, with the small group you're isolating with, or even online with a group of friends. \"Trivia games are great party games for large groups playing virtually,\" she says.  But if you haven't bought any games yet, you'd better act fast.  Filip Francke, CEO of Ravensburger North America and global head of games, says there's a sales surge equal to what they'd expect in December around the holidays. \"Board games are selling up to five times more over the last four weeks compared to this same time last year,\" he says.  Francke recommends taking advantage of the free time to find new games that get better the more you play them. \"With a little more time at hand there are so much more out there to explore than Monopoly,\" he says.  \"So if you have the time, venture into the unknown!\" Francke recommends trying logic games like Rush Hour and Gravity Maze if you're playing solo, as well as highly replayable games such as Disney Villainous and Horrified: Universal Monsters.  If you're ready to get your game on, we've rounded up more recommendations from Francke and Bilanko below, as well as some of our favorites based on their guidance.
