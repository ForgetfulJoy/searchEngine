Find all our coronavirus-related coverage here, and let us know your thoughts here. It's one thing to stuff your shopping cart on your increasingly rare grocery store runs with Twinkies, tortilla chips and boxes of cake mix and macaroni and cheese. You run little chance of those things turning bad on you between now and the next time you venture out during this time of shelter-in-place orders. But produce? That's something you want as fresh as possible. Whether you're a vegan, a vegetarian, trying to eat plant-based, or just looking to add in a meatless meal or dish now and then, we've rounded up eight companies offering delivery services that range from premade vegan meals, to ingredients to make your own vegan recipes, to fruit and veggie boxes, to frozen smoothies ready to be popped in your blender and enjoyed. And if you do eat meat, check out our guide on meat delivery services working in this time, as well as meal kit delivery services that help take the guesswork out of dinner.  Just because you can't eat out doesn't mean you can't eat well.  Veestro  Who it's for: The strict vegan who doesn't really like to cook. The basics: If your idea of cooking is opening up your takeout bag and digging right in, Veestro will feel like a godsend. Made entirely with plant-based, organic, preservative-free ingredients, these precooked meals arrive frozen, so all you need to do is heat them in the microwave or oven.  Plan options: Choose from three plans: \u00c0 La Carte, Chef's Choice or Weight Loss. With \u00c0 La Carte, you select from entree and breakfast options (think country fried chick'n, Asian noodle salad or Spanish torta) with categories including high-protein, gluten-free, low-calorie, nut-free, soy-free and kosher. With Chef's Choice, the company's most popular plan, you'll get a preselected menu (enchilada casserole or pad thai? Yum!) under the category of customer favorites, high protein or gluten-free. And Weight Loss (we're craving the oatmeal breakfast pie and the red curry with tofu) includes three meals a day, with a total of around 1,200 calories per day. Change your meals, pause delivery or cancel at any time. Pricing: For the \u00c0 La Carte and Chef's Choice plans, choose a box with 10 ($117), 20 ($216) or 30 meals ($297). Boxes may be delivered every week, every two weeks or every four weeks. For the Weight Loss option, choose from a five-day ($175.50) or seven-day ($226.80) plan. _______________________________________________________________________________ Purple Carrot  Who it's for: The vegan who really likes to cook.
