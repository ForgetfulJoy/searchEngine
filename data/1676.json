Here's who had the best and worst night: Winners: Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump\nLosers: Michael Bloomberg, Elizabeth Warren, the moderators, the live audience Read Cillizza's take on why here. ##Moments## Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar described tonight's Democratic debate in South Carolina as \"another slug fest.\" \"If we\u2019re going to spend the next four months tearing the party apart, then we\u2019ll be able to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing the country apart,\" she told CNN's Dana Bash and Erin Burnett following the debate. Early in the debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders used an inaccurate figure that had been provided to his campaign by a\u00a0progressive think tank\u00a0that, among other things,\u00a0keeps track of the fortunes of billionaires.\u00a0 \u201cIn the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0The think tank that provided the figure says it is wrong, and says it takes responsibility for the error.\u00a0 Sanders was relying on a figure from the Institute for Policy Studies, according to the think tank senior scholar Chuck Collins but the number was inflated.\u00a0\u201cWe informed Senator Sanders that US billionaires increased their wealth since Trump\u2019s election by $850 billion. Our updated number is $710 billion, an increase of 30 percent,\u201d Collins told CNN\u00a0during the debate.\u00a0 \u201cSenator Sanders was accurately using information that we provided, so we at Institute for Policy Studies are responsible for the error,\u201d Collins added.\u00a0 He said that in 2016, there were 541 US billionaires with wealth totaling about $2.4 trillion. In 2019, he said, there were 607 US billionaires with wealth totaling about $3.1 trillion.\u00a0 Collins said he informed the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning that there had been an error, after CNN contacted the campaign to ask for the source for the $850 billion number.\u00a0It is not clear, though, whether Sanders himself was informed of the error prior to the debate.\u00a0 There is no doubt that the wealthiest Americans have gotten wealthier under President Trump, though others have also gained.\u00a0 According to the Federal Reserve,\u00a0the\u00a0combined\u00a0wealth of the top 1% of American households increased 18% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 \u2014 from $29.18 to $34.53 trillion.\u00a0The\u00a0combined\u00a0wealth of the bottom 50% of households increased 55%, but from a much smaller starting point \u2014 from $1.08 trillion to $1.67 trillion\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and spread out across many more households.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## Sen. Amy Klobuchar claimed during tonight's Democratic debate that a Vanderbilt University study ranked her as the most effective Democrat in the Senate and that two of\u00a0her\u00a0competitors for the Democratic nomination,\u00a0Sens.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, ranked among the bottom half of the list.\u00a0\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0Klobuchar\u00a0is right about herself. She\u00a0did rank among the most effective members of the Senate\u00a0and first among Democrats, according to that study. She\u2019s also right that Warren ranked among the bottom half of Democrats. Her characterization\u00a0of Sanders\u2019 ineffectiveness within the Democratic Party, though,\u00a0requires clarification.\u00a0 Klobuchar said\u00a0during the debate in South Carolina\u00a0that \u201caccording to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the\u00a0US\u00a0Senate\u00a0on 15 metrics. Bernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters \u2014 it matters if you can actually get things done.\"\u00a0 The Center for Effective Lawmaking at Vanderbilt evaluates\u00a0the effectiveness of members of Congress and according to their evaluation of the 115th\u00a0Congress\u00a0(2017-2019), Klobuchar ranked as the most effective Democrat in the Senate.\u00a0\u00a0 What Vanderbilt calls the\u00a0\u201cLegislative Effectiveness Score\u201d\u00a0is \u201cbased on 15 metrics that take into account the number of bills a legislator sponsors, how far each of those bills advances through the legislative process from introduction to (possibly) becoming law and its relative substantive significance.\u201d The average Legislative Effectiveness Score is 1.0.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Klobuchar has a score of 2.815, ranking\u00a0first\u00a0among the 48 Democrats in the Senate during that time.\u00a0And Warren has a score of .548 and ranks 32nd\u00a0out of 48 Democrats in the Senate.\u00a0\u00a0 Sanders caucuses with Democrats, but since he is elected as an independent in Congress, he was not ranked among those within the party as Klobuchar suggested. Sanders has a score of .159. Sanders\u2019\u00a0and Warren\u2019s rankings are\u00a0below 1.0, the average among all members of Congress.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said Bernie Sanders is \"like a fortress\" under questioning on stage. \"I have been there.\u00a0He has a force field.\u00a0Everything you say it's like, 'Let\u00a0me be clear.\u00a0I'm going to talk about what I'm\u00a0going to talk about.\u00a0It's not really going to be what\u00a0you ask me about,'\" he said on CNN following the debate. Yang added that Sanders will then \"go into a Bernieism\" rather than addressing the question. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders defended his sweeping plan to overhaul America\u2019s health insurance system, saying \u201cMedicare for All\u201d will reduce the nation\u2019s health care price tag.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat every study out there, conservative or progressive says, 'Medicare For All' will save money,\u201d said Sanders, who came under fire for the cost of his proposal, which has been pegged\u00a0at more than $30 trillion over a decade.\u00a0 Facts first:\u00a0Although Sanders is correct that\u00a0several\u00a0studies have found \"Medicare for All\" would reduce health care spending, at least one study published last year found the opposite.\u00a0 A\u00a0report from the left-leaning\u00a0Urban Institute Health Policy Center showed that the nation's overall health care spending would rise by roughly $7 trillion to $59 trillion over a decade if Medicare for All goes into effect. The increase would be $720 billion for 2020 alone if the policy were enacted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's because more people would be insured, more benefits would be\u00a0covered\u00a0and more medical services would be used since there'd be no cost for care.\u00a0 \"You will in total spend more as a nation on health care from adding all the bells and whistles that are associated with these kinds of proposals,\" Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow, said when the study was published last October.\u00a0 ##Fact Check## President Donald Trump took to Twitter to respond to the presidential candidates at tonight\u2019s Democratic debate after they were critical of his response to the novel coronavirus. \u201cCDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world. It was opposed by the Dems, \u2018too soon\u2019, but turned out to be the correct decision,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo matter how well we do, however, the (\u2026) Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let\u2019s keep it that way!\u201d What happened: CNN previously reported\u00a0that the Democratic candidates were asked tonight how they would address the growing epidemic if they were president. Former Vice President Joe Biden talked about his experience dealing with the Ebola outbreak during his time in the Obama administration and went after Trump, saying Trump wiped out federal budgets for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sen. Bernie Sanders also went after the President for his comments that the coronavirus will stop spreading once the weather gets warmer. \"In the White House today, we\u00a0have a self-described great\u00a0genius \u2014 self-described \u2014 and\u00a0this great genius has told us\u00a0that this coronavirus is going\u00a0to end in two months.\u00a0April is the magical date that\u00a0this great scientist we have in\u00a0the White House has\u00a0determined \u2014 I wish I was\u00a0kidding, that is what he said,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 Former Vice President Joe Biden said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders encouraged a primary challenge to\u00a0President Barack\u00a0Obama in 2012. \u201cHe said we should primary Barack Obama,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSomeone should.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0This is true. Sanders said\u00a0on a radio show\u00a0in July 2011 that\u00a0a primary challenge\u00a0to Obama would\u00a0do \u201ca good deal of service\u201d to the country. \u201cSo my suggestion is, I think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing,\u201d Sanders\u00a0said\u00a0on the Thom Hartmann Show in July 2011.\u00a0 \u201cI think one of the reasons that President Obama has moved as far to the right as he has is he thinks he can go all the way and no one will stand up to him,\u201d Sanders added. On WNYC in March 2011,\u00a0Sanders\u00a0said\u00a0a primary challenge to Obama would \u201cenliven the debate.\u201d \u201cI'm not a Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm the longest-serving independent. I think if a progressive Democrat wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues and people have a right to do that.\u201d Sanders went on to endorse Obama in 2012. ##Fact Check## The seven candidates gave a closing statement to wrap up tonight's debate, the last one before Saturday's primary in South Carolina and Super Tuesday. Asked to describe the biggest misconception about them and their mottos, here's how they responded:  Joe Biden said his motto is, \"When you get knocked down,\u00a0get up, and everyone is entitled\u00a0to be treated with dignity no\u00a0matter what or who they are.\" He went on to say that he's committed to putting a black woman on the Supreme Court. On the biggest misconception, Biden said, \"I have more hair than I\u00a0think I do.\"\nMichael Bloomberg joked that a misconception about him is that he's \"6\u00a0feet tall.\" On his motto, the former New York Mayor was direct, \"I've trained for this job\u00a0for a long time and when I get\u00a0it I'm going to do something,\u00a0rather than just talk about it.\"\nPete Buttigieg said people think \"I'm not passionate.\" The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor went on to say that he seeks to \"live by the teachings\u00a0that say if you would be a leader,\u00a0you must first be a servant.\"\nBernie Sanders said the biggest misconception about him is that his ideas are\u00a0\"radical.\" He went on to cite a quote from Nelson Mandela as a motto he lives by, saying, \"Everything is impossible until\u00a0it happens.\"\nElizabeth Warren said one\u00a0misconception about her \"is that I don't\u00a0eat very much.\"\u00a0She added, \"In fact, I eat all the time.\" On her motto, Warren quoted Bible Scripture: \"In as much as ye\u00a0have done\u00a0it\u00a0unto one\u00a0of the\u00a0least\u00a0of my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\"\nAmy Klobuchar said the biggest\u00a0misconception about her is that \"I'm boring\u00a0because I'm not.\" She added that her motto is \"that politics is about\u00a0improving people's lives.\"\u00a0\nTom Steyer said one misconception\u00a0about him is that \"somehow I'm\u00a0defined by business success and\u00a0money.\" On his personal motto, he said, \"Every day, I write a cross on\u00a0my hand to remind myself to tell\u00a0the truth and do what's right,\u00a0no matter what.\" ##Moments## At the end of the debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders had a clear lead in speaking time with nearly 16 minutes, followed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, all at more than 13 minutes. See the full breakdown below. Asked about his recent comment praising Fidel Castro's literacy program from the early 1960s, Bernie Sanders insisted that he has always \"opposed authoritarianism all over the world.\"\u00a0\u00a0 He then turned to Michael Bloomberg, who had moments earlier said he could work with the Chinese government because its leader is responsive to its \"politburo.\" \"I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have a real dictatorship there,\" Sanders said. Turning back to Cuba, Sanders said \"of course\" it was a dictatorship but argued that he hadn't gone any farther in praising it than former President Barack Obama did during his efforts to open up relations with the country during his second term.  \"What Barack Obama said was they made great progress on education and health care,\" Sanders said. \"That was Barack Obama.\" As Biden tried to step in to dispute Obama's intentions, Sanders argued that the entire debate was missing out on the harsh reality of the US's own role in global discord.  \"Occasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world \u2014 in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran, and when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans, do something good, you acknowledge that, but you don't have to trade love letters with them,\" Sanders said. In a recent CNN town hall, Bernie Sanders responded to Cuba criticism: ##Moments## Elizabeth Warren called on Michael Bloomberg to release his tax returns, noting he is the only candidate on stage who hasn't released them.  \u201cWe know that Mayor Bloomberg has\u00a0been doing business with China\u00a0for a long time, and he is the\u00a0only one on this stage who has\u00a0not released his taxes,\u201d Warren said.\u00a0 \u201cHe plans to release them after\u00a0Super Tuesday,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cIt is not enough to be able to\u00a0say, just trust me on this.\u201d\u00a0Warren went on to say President Trump promised to release his taxes when he was running for president but never did.\u00a0 Bloomberg said his campaign is working as fast as it can and will release his tax returns.  \u201cI got into this race only 10 or\u00a012 weeks ago, we have been\u00a0working on our tax returns, I\u2019ve said they will be out, we probably have\u00a0another couple of weeks left to go,\u00a0we're doing it as fast we can,\u00a0we've complied with every single requirement\u00a0for disclosure,\" Bloomberg said.  \u201cAnd when I was mayor of New York we\u00a0had our tax returns out 12 years\u00a0in a row and we will do that in\u00a0the White House,\u201d Bloomberg continued.\u00a0 ##Moments## Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar claimed on Tuesday that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"'Medicare For All' plan alone, on page 8, clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years.\"\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0While\u00a0Page 8 of Sanders\u2019 bill\u00a0does not specifically mention the figure cited by Klobuchar, it states that \u201cit shall be unlawful for ... a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided\u00a0under this Act.\u201d\u00a0And the Klobuchar\u2019s figure\u00a0is close to the latest number provided by one study. Some 153 million people are covered by private plans sponsored by their employers, according to the latest\u00a0report\u00a0from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\u00a0 There are also tens of millions more who are covered by private plans through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care plans and on the Obamacare individual market.\u00a0\u00a0 All these people would have to change their health care under\u00a0Sanders\u2019\u00a0Medicare for All\u00a0plan\u00a0\u2014 but they would be covered by the federal plan instead.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Fact Check## The global spread of the coronavirus came up during tonight's debate. The candidates were asked how they would address the growing epidemic as president.   Responding first, Sen. Klobuchar said, \"What we have to do is make\u00a0sure we have treatment for those\u00a0Americans and that they are in a\u00a0quarantine situation.\u00a0We don't want to expose people,\u00a0but we want to give them help.\" The Minnesota Democrat encouraged people who feel sick to keep checking the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention's website because she said \"many doctors are just\u00a0saying it's just a matter of\u00a0time before we're going to start\u00a0seeing this here.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden talked about his experience dealing with the Ebola outbreak during his time in the Obama administration. \"I was\u00a0part of making sure that\u00a0pandemic did not get to the\u00a0United States, saved millions of\u00a0lives.\u00a0What we did, we set up, I helped\u00a0set up that office in the\u00a0presidency, in the president's\u00a0office on diseases that are\u00a0pandemic diseases.\u00a0We increased the budget of the\u00a0CDC, we increased the (National Institutes of Health)\u00a0budget.\u00a0Our President today, he's wiped\u00a0all that out.\u00a0We did it.\u00a0We stopped it.\" Biden attacked President Trump for cutting funding to the CDC. Sen. Bernie Sanders echoed that criticism of Trump.  He also went after the President for his comments that the coronavirus will stop spreading once the weather gets warmer.  \"In the White House today, we\u00a0have a self-described great\u00a0genius \u2014 self-described \u2014 and\u00a0this great genius has told us\u00a0that this coronavirus is going\u00a0to end in two months.\u00a0April is the magical date that\u00a0this great scientist we have in\u00a0the White House has\u00a0determined \u2014 I wish I was\u00a0kidding, that is what he said.\" Trump downplays coronavirus despite venting in private: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg previously supported Republican candidates.\u00a0 \u201cWe're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week? It\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe's going to be here to raise money for his buddy, Senator Lindsey Graham. Who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for reelection last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg. And that's not the only right-wing senator that mayor Bloomberg has funded.\u201d \u201cIn 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania senate race to help reelect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator,\u201d Warren added. \u201cAnd I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point. In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard.\u201d Facts first:\u00a0This is true. Bloomberg supported\u00a0Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s re-election in 2016. He supported Scott Brown in\u00a0his losing effort against Warren in 2012. In 2014,\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0gave money to a super-PAC supporting Lindsey Graham. Bloomberg\u00a0spent\u00a0nearly $12 million in 2016 to support the reelection of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, an ally of his on the issue of background checks on gun purchases. The New York Times also reported in November he supported Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in 2014.\u00a0 In 2012, Bloomberg supported Brown over Warren, saying on his radio program as mayor he supported Brown because of Brown\u2019s stance against requiring states to recognize concealed carry laws from other states.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tonight, Bloomberg called such attacks a \u201cside show\u201d and not relevant to his record as mayor. ##Fact Check## Addressing his history with the controversial stop and frisk policy, Mike Bloomberg claimed the incidents decreased by 95% while he was mayor of New York.\u00a0 \"We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95%. And I\u2019ve apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time,\" he said. Facts First:\u00a0\u00a0Bloomberg, as he has done\u00a0before, was misleading by omission when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk. While there was such a\u00a0reduction, it happened only during the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, from the first quarter of 2012 to the last quarter of 2013, following a\u00a0605% increase\u00a0in his first 10 years. Looking at his entire mayoralty, from 2002 through 2013, there was a 97%\u00a0increase, not a decrease.\u00a0 Bloomberg also claimed the 95% was prompted by his realization that the situation was \u201cout of control.\u201d He does not mention that the decline began right around the time a federal judge signaled she would rule against stop and frisk, nor that he continued to be a vocal defender of stop and frisk for years after his professed realization about the harms of the policy. You can read more about Bloomberg\u2019s history with stop and frisk\u00a0here. ##Fact Check## Michael Bloomberg mentioned the \"Naked Cowboy\" \u2014 a shirtless and underpants-clad guitarist in Times Square \u2014 while explaining why he enforced tough policies as New York City's mayor. The CBS moderator brought up tonight his bans on trans fats and his war on obesity, then asked, \"Will you push those policies on\u00a0the national level as well if\u00a0you become president?\"\u00a0 Here's how Bloomberg responded:  \"New York City isn't like all\u00a0other cities otherwise you would\u00a0have a\u00a0naked\u00a0cowboy\u00a0in every\u00a0city.\u00a0Let's get serious here.\u00a0But I do think it's good government to\u00a0teach people good science, and explain to people what science says and how to take care of themselves and\u00a0extend their\u00a0lives,\" he said. He went on to defend the city's ban on smoking in public places and support of public health. ##Moments## The Democrats running for president may be split between \"Medicare for All,\" the sweeping, government health insurance proposal supported by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and a more moderate public insurance option that the other candidates favor. But the health care industry wants viewers of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate to know that neither reform is palatable, at least not to them. The Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future, a coalition of groups representing insurers, hospitals, drug makers, employers and others, launched a national 30-second ad, entitled \u201cPriorities,\u201d during the South Carolina debate. It features a woman saying that government-controlled health insurance is a \u201creal threat\u201d to people\u2019s health coverage. \u00a0She goes on to say that Medicare for All and the public option could double Americans\u2019 income taxes and raise premiums. Instead, \u201cit\u2019s time to build on what\u2019s working and fix what\u2019s broken. Not start over.\u201d The ad will run on CBS television stations and digital properties, as well as on Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. The partnership has a lot of convincing to do. About two thirds of voters polled in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada said they support a single-payer health care system. As of the second commercial break, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg leads the pack with almost 10 minutes of speaking time. See the full breakdown below, and follow along live here. ##Moments## Michael Bloomberg said he would support decriminalizing marijuana, though he wants to see its legality expanded by the states \u201cvery slowly.\u201d \u201cWe should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those who got caught up in this before,\u201d the former New York mayor said. Bloomberg said he wouldn\u2019t try to undo the efforts of states that have legalized marijuana. But he said the government should heed the warnings of scientists. \u201cThey say go very slowly, they haven\u2019t done enough research and the evidence so far is worrisome,\u201d he said. ##Moments## The candidates were asked how they will ensure there is\u00a0available health care in rural\u00a0areas of the country that have have populations who\u00a0are older, sicker, poorer\u00a0and  have to travel farther to\u00a0get medical help when they need\u00a0it.\u00a0 Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she is for expanding \"critical access hospitals\" in rural areas.\u00a0\"Actually, I am the lead Democrat\u00a0on a bill to extend that, to\u00a0have other types of hospitals,\u00a0like emergency rooms in rural\u00a0areas be covered.\" Mayor Pete Buttigieg said a big part of the problem is \"we're seeing hospital closures,\u00a0right and left\" in rural areas.\u00a0 He added: \"And we're seeing them, in\u00a0particular, in states where\u00a0medicaid was not expanded.\u00a0Something that is hurting black\u00a0and poor white families and is\u00a0largely the results of racial\u00a0voters suppression.\"\u00a0 Sen. Bernie Sanders said that under his Medicare For All plan, \"We will have health care for\u00a0all people in all parts of this\u00a0country.\" It's hard to get over the range of ages and experiences on the debate stage. Consider that in 1981, the year Mike Bloomberg was fired from Salomon and got the $10 million severance he used to found Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders was elected as a lonely socialist mayor in Burlington, Vermont, making a steady paycheck perhaps for the first time in his life. Here's what all the candidates were doing that year: Bernie elected mayor, getting a steady paycheck and making 33k a year\nBloomberg fired from Salomon, given $10 million severance\nWarren gets job as law professor at University of Texas\nBiden was 7 years a senator\nKlobuchar was a senior at Yale\nSteyer left his job as an analyst at Morgan Stanley\nButtigieg was not yet born\u00a0 In an early exchange\u00a0during Tuesday\u00a0night\u2019s\u00a0Democratic presidential debate,\u00a0former New York Mayor Michael\u00a0Bloomberg told\u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie\u00a0Sanders that \u201c(Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be President of the United States, and that\u2019s why Russia is helping you get elected.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Sanders tried to fend off the attacks by condemning Russian meddling in the 2016 election and warning Putin that he wouldn\u2019t be a Russia-friendly president.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0Bloomberg accurately\u00a0pointed\u00a0to a\u00a0US intelligence community belief that\u00a0Russia is trying to help Sanders\u2019 campaign. Russia also backed Sanders in\u00a0the\u00a02016 primary, but Sanders has publicly denounced Russian interference in US politics.\u00a0\u00a0 Sanders acknowledged last week that\u00a0US intelligence officials had informed his team\u00a0that Russia was trying to help his campaign.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear what\u00a0Russians\u00a0are doing to help Sanders, and there haven\u2019t yet been any sweeping hack-and-leak operations like the cyberattacks that hit the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign.\u00a0 US intelligence leaders have said that Russia routinely tries to sow discord among the American public and amplify voices on the extremes of the political spectrum, to inflame divisions and undermine the stability of American democracy. Their past support for Sanders and Trump, who have both antagonized their own parties, fits into this big-picture strategy.\u00a0 Separately, a senior US intelligence official, Shelby Pierson,\u00a0told lawmakers earlier this month\u00a0in a classified briefing that Russia was taking steps to help Trump win reelection. CNN later reported that Pierson appears to have overstated the formal assessments from the US intelligence community, and senior White House officials rebutted\u00a0her comments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Russian government, at Putin\u2019s direction, undertook an extensive campaign in 2016 to boost Sanders\u2019 primary campaign against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and to help Trump defeat Clinton in the general election. The Kremlin operation included well-funded troll farms, propaganda on social media, cyberattacks and leaks of private emails.\u00a0 \u00a0##Fact check## Elizabeth Warren interjected during a discussion about housing to call on the stage to address racial disparities like \"red lining,\" which prevented African Americans from buying homes for decades, and left an enduring legacy of inequality around the country. \"We can no longer pretend that every thing is race neutral,\" Warren said. \"We have got to address race consciously what\u2019s happening in this country.\" \"It is important to recognize\u00a0the role that the federal\u00a0government played for decades\u00a0and decades in discriminating against African Americans having\u00a0an opportunity to buy homes,\" she said.\u00a0\"That's red lining.\"\u00a0 Warren then turned to Bloomberg, who once suggested that the end of red lining played a role in the 2008 financial crisis.  \"While Mayor Bloomberg was\u00a0blaming the housing crash of 2008\u00a0on African Americans and on\u00a0Latinos, in fact, I was out\u00a0there fighting for a consumer\u00a0agency to make sure people never\u00a0get cheated again on their\u00a0mortgages,\" Warren said, touting her housing plan. Pete Buttigieg hit Bernie Sanders on Tuesday for not supporting ending the filibuster, a Senate rule that if ended would allow bills to be passed with only a simple majority. Buttigieg has used nearly every answer on the debate stage to target Sanders, the race\u2019s front-runner and a candidate who the former mayor has said could have an insurmountable lead in early March. \u201cI want to come back to the\u00a0question of the filibuster\u00a0because this is not some\u00a0long-ago bad vote that Bernie\u00a0Sanders took, this is a current bad position\u00a0that Bernie Sanders holds,\u201d Buttigieg said. Then he delivered a direct line: \u201cHow are we going to deliver a\u00a0revolution if you won't even\u00a0support a rule change?\u201d Sanders has said he supports filibuster reform, but does not support getting rid of the rule. \u201cWe are in the state where Strom\u00a0Thurmond used the filibuster to\u00a0block civil rights legislation\u00a0repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg said, referring to a late United States senator and segregationist from South Carolina. \u201cNo less a Senate traditional\u00a0figure than Harry Reid has\u00a0called for it to go.\u00a0It has got to go, because\u00a0otherwise Washington will not\u00a0deliver.\u201d ##Moments## Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg were in a heated exchange over electability when Elizabeth Warren interrupted them to support Sanders' \"progressive agenda.\" Sanders argued that he can beat President Trump and will do so with \"an\u00a0unprecedented, grassroots\u00a0movement of black and white and\u00a0Latino, Native American and\u00a0Asian people who are standing\u00a0up and fighting for justice.\" Bloomberg interjected to say, \"Imagine moderate\u00a0Republicans going over and\u00a0voting for him? And you have to do that or\u00a0you can't win.\" That's when Warren stepped into the debate to disagree with Bloomberg. \"A progressive\u00a0agenda is popular, Mayor\u00a0Bloomberg.\u00a0And for everyone on this stage,\" she said. \"We talk about how to build a\u00a0future.\u00a0That's what matters,\" Warren said. Mike Bloomberg, touting the millions he spent to help elect Democrats to the House in 2018, came close to saying that he \u201cbought\u201d the race, but caught himself and said, \u201cI got them.\u201d \u201cThey talk about 40 Democrats\u201d that were elected to deliver a Democratic majority in 2018, Bloomberg said. \u201cTwenty-one of those were people they\u00a0spent $100 million to help\u00a0elect.\u201d He added: \u201cAll of the new Democrats that\u00a0came in, put Nancy Pelosi in\u00a0charge, and gave the Congress\u00a0the ability to control this President, I boug\u2026 I got them.\u201d ##Moments## Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday night echoed the fears some Democrats have about nominating Bernie Sanders, using a back-and-forth with the Vermont senator to warn that a candidate at the top of the ticket who self-identifies as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d could hurt down ballot races for the House and Senate. Buttigieg said nominating Sanders would lead to \u201cfour more years of\u00a0Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy\u00a0as Speaker of the House, and the\u00a0inability to get the Senate in\u00a0Democratic hands.\u201d \u201cThe time has come to stop acting\u00a0like the presidency is the only\u00a0office that matters.\u00a0Not only is this a way to get\u00a0Donald Trump re-elected.\u00a0We have a House to worry about.\u00a0We have a Senate to worry about.\u00a0And this is really important,\u201d Buttigieg continued. More moderate Democrats \u2013 including those who won their seats in 2018 \u2013 have publicly expressed concerns about what Sanders atop the ticket would mean for down ballot races. Buttigieg, as he has focused most of his attacks on Sanders, has stoked these fears, highlighting what he believes is the need to defend these House seats and broaden the Democratic base. \u201cIf you want to keep the house\u00a0in Democratic hands, you might\u00a0want to check with the people\u00a0who actually turned the house\u00a0blue,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cForty Democrats who are not\u00a0running on your platform.\u00a0They are running away from your\u00a0platform as fast as they\u00a0possibly can. I want to send those Democrats\u00a0back to the United States House.\u201d After the Nevada caucuses, Pete Buttigieg went after Bernie Sanders: ##Moments## Joe Biden and Tom Steyer attacked each other\u2019s records on race in a tense exchange as the two men vie for the support of African American voters in South Carolina ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary.\u00a0 Biden lambasted the billionaire businessman for investing in private prisons. \u201cThey hogtied young men in prison here in this state. They in fact made sure that in Georgia they did not have health care for the people that were being held,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cYou wrote the crime bill,\u201d Steyer shot back, referencing the 1994 legislation signed into law by former President Bill Clinton and noting that it had imposed stiff mandatory minimum sentences that had left hundreds of thousands of black and brown people in jail.\u00a0 \u201cTommy come lately,\u201d Biden quipped as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar interjected and ended the exchange.\u00a0 ##Moments## We're tracking approximate speaking times during tonight's debate. As of the first commercial break, Sen. Elizabeth Warren currently leads the pack with almost six minutes, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders. See the full breakdown below, and follow along live here. ##Moments## Addressing her fellow candidates on stage, Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, \"If we spend the next four\u00a0months tearing our party apart,\u00a0we're going to watch Donald\u00a0Trump spend the next four years\u00a0tearing our country apart.\" She continued by pointing out that she does not think Bernie Sanders is the right person to nominate. \"I like Bernie.\u00a0We came in together to the\u00a0Senate.\u00a0But I do not think that this is\u00a0the best person to lead the\u00a0ticket.\" Elizabeth Warren called out Michael Bloomberg over reports he told a female employee, who told him she was pregnant, to \"kill it.\" Bloomberg denied having made the comment, shooting back: \"I never said that.\" Warren also hit Bloomberg for backing the Republican senator, Scott Brown, she challenged and defeated in 2012.  The Massachusetts senator first brought up Bloomberg's support for GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who narrowly held off Democratic challenger Katie McGinty in 2016. \"He dumped $12 million\u00a0into the Pennsylvania Senate\u00a0race to help re-elect an\u00a0anti-choice, right-wing\u00a0Republican senator. And I just want to say, the\u00a0woman challenger was terrific,\" Warren said of the Toomey-McGinty race.\u00a0 Then Warren turned to her own race. \"In 2012, (Bloomberg) scooped in to try to\u00a0defend another Republican\u00a0senator against a woman\u00a0challenger,\" Warren said.\u00a0\"That was me.\u00a0It didn't work, but he tried\u00a0hard.\" ##Moments## Asked if he thought New York City's implementation of \"stop and frisk\" under former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg was racist, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg responded, \"Yes, in effect, it was.\"  He added: \"Because it was about profiling\u00a0people based on their race.\" Buttigieg went on to point out that he's \"conscious\u00a0of the fact that there are seven\u00a0white people on this stage\u00a0talking about racial justice.\" \"\u00a0None of us \u2014 none of us have the\u00a0experience, the lived experience\u00a0of -- for example, walking down\u00a0the street, or in a mall, and\u00a0feeling\u00a0feeling eyes on us, regarding us\u00a0as dangerous, without knowing\u00a0the first thing about us justice\u00a0because of the color of our\u00a0skin.\" ##Moments## Pete Buttigieg used an exchange with Bernie Sanders over the number of billionaires who have donated to his campaign to hit back at the Vermont senator \u2014 and then raise some money. Sanders, hitting back at a number of attacks he was facing on Tuesday, said, \u201cAmericans don't want candidates to be\u00a0running to billionaires for huge\u00a0amounts of funding.\u201d He specifically called out Buttigieg. The former mayor said it was \u201cuntrue\u201d and noted that his campaign has donations from more than 2,000 people \u201cin Charleston alone.\u201d \u201cGrassroots contributions are the\u00a0life blood of my campaign,\u201d Buttigieg said, then turned the answer into a pitch for his own campaign. \u201cI shouldn't miss the\u00a0opportunity, if you're watching\u00a0right now and you support my\u00a0campaign go to\u00a0peteforamerica.com, and chip in,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you are watching right\u00a0now, and you're a billionaire, I\u00a0will raise your taxes.\u00a0But if you'd like to defeat\u00a0Donald Trump, please go to\u00a0peteforamerica.com and donate\u00a0legal maximum of $2,800.\u201d Sanders was seen laughing at the pitch. Joe Biden criticized Bernie Sanders for his votes against the Brady Bill in 1993 and reports that the Vermont senator considered a primary campaign against then-President Barack Obama in 2012 \u2014 which Sanders denies.\u00a0 Biden said he\u2019d sought a longer waiting period before handgun purchases in the Brady Bill than what Sanders had supported. He noted that the debate was taking place within walking distance of the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the site of a 2015 massacre at which a white supremacist gunman left nine dead. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon had the waiting period been what I suggested,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 He also pointed to reports about Sanders having considered a primary challenge against Obama \u2014 a potentially significant negative for Sanders in South Carolina, a state where more than half the Democratic primary electorate is African American.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s talk about progressive: Progressive is getting things done, and that\u2019s what we got done \u2014 we got a lot done,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders said the economy is \u201cdoing really great\u201d for billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, and said his own campaign is about creating an \u201ceconomy for all.\u201d CBS\u2019s Norah O\u2019Donnell said, \u201cWe haven't had\u00a0a national unemployment rate\u00a0this low for this long in 50\u00a0years.\u00a0Here in South Carolina, the\u00a0unemployment rate is even lower.\u00a0How will you convince voters\u00a0that a Democratic Socialist can\u00a0do better than President Trump\u00a0with with the economy?\u00a0 \u201cWell, you're right.\u00a0The economy is doing really\u00a0great for people like\u00a0Mr. Bloomberg and other\u00a0billionaires,\u201d Sanders responded.\u00a0 He said billionaires have seen an increase in wealth in the last several years, while many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\u00a0 \u201cFor\u00a0for the ordinary American,\u00a0things are not so good,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 \u201cThat is not an economy that's\u00a0working for the American people,\" he said.\u00a0\"That's an economy working for\u00a0the 1%.\u00a0We're going to create an economy\u00a0for all, not just wealthy\u00a0campaign contributors.\" ##Moments## In an early tense exchange, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg attacked front runner Bernie Sanders directly claiming \"Russia is helping you get elected.\" Sanders snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Bloomberg.\" Sanders continued: \"Hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm President\u00a0of the United States, trust me,\u00a0you're not going to interfere in\u00a0any more American elections.\"\u00a0 ##Moments## Elizabeth Warren has been quietly chipping away at her progressive pal Bernie Sanders for weeks.  On Tuesday night, she upped the ante during her opening comments. Warren said she was on Sanders' side on a number of issues, but then attacked the front-runner over his approach to health care. \"Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t explain how to get there. Doesn\u2019t show how we\u2019re going to get enough allies into it and doesn\u2019t show enough about how we\u2019re gonna pay for it,\" Warren said.   And then, the dagger: \"I dug in, I did the work (on the financing) and then Bernie\u2019s team trashed me for it,\" Warren said. Warren was subject to some progressive criticism after she released her Medicare for All financing and transition plans. Sanders and his campaign offered some mild criticism. His supporters, though, were more aggressive, questioning Warren's commitment to the legislation. ##Moments## Bernie Sanders is standing in center stage solo \u2014 for the first time. Why this matters: It reflects his clear front-runner status. Also new onstage tonight is the podium order. Pete Buttigieg standing between Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. CBS said the podium order was determined using a combination of polling averages and the current delegate count. The candidates are now taking the stage at the 10th Democratic debate in South Carolina. This is the final time that the primary field will appear together onstage before Saturday's South Carolina primary and \"Super Tuesday\" on March 3. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is prepared to respond to Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s demand that he issue a blanket release on all nondisclosure agreements, including those pertaining to his company, his aide said. On Friday, Bloomberg said that women covered by three nondisclosure agreements who had\u00a0made complaints against him\u00a0can be released from those pacts if they contact his company. \ufeff\u201cWe\u2019re ready for Warren to attack him tonight on NDAs,\u201d the Bloomberg aide said. What's this about: During the last presidential debate in Nevada, Warren\u00a0eviscerated Bloomberg\u00a0for his alleged comments about women and reports that dozens of women who left his company had signed nondisclosure agreements, barring them from publicly discussing their experiences. Bonnie P. Josephs, the former attorney for one of the women Bloomberg released last week, Sekiko Sakai Garrison, told CNN, \u201cBloomberg should have released all the NDAs\u00a0without demanding\u00a0an\u00a0application for release, and he\u00a0should\u00a0have stated\u00a0that he would not sue\u00a0anyone who revealed\u00a0the truth.\" CBS has released the order of the\u00a0debate\u00a0lineup tonight, with Pete Buttigieg standing between Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. The network said the podium order was determined using a combination of polling averages and the current delegate count. Last week, of course, you\u2019ll remember Bloomberg and Warren were side-by-side. Here is the lineup of the podium order: Former New York City Michael Bloomberg\nFormer South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\nBusinessman Tom Steyer Jane Sanders said her husband, Bernie Sanders, expects to be a target at tonight's debate. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett asked Jane Sanders, \u201cIs he going into tonight feeling like they\u2019re all going to be coming at him?\u201d Sanders responded, \u201cYes, I mean I think that\u2019s what comes with being the front-runner.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be there, but being in the center of the stage brings people on both sides really going after, from what we\u2019ve seen today leading up to it, a number of the other candidates are really gunning for him,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Sanders said some of Michael Bloomberg\u2019s staff \u201chave spoken out ridiculously\u00a0over the day and his social media is full of really inaccuracies. So it\u2019s worrisome.\u201d Watch the moment: Bernie Sanders just might win the South Carolina primary on Saturday. That's the real headline out of a\u00a0new poll conducted by NBC and Marist College\u00a0that shows Sanders trailing longtime South Carolina front-runner Joe Biden by a narrow 27% to 23% margin, with five days of campaigning remaining. (Several recent polls\u00a0have suggested a similar tightening.) Roughly 1 in 3 Biden backers in the poll (32%) said they might vote for another candidate on Saturday. Just more than 1 in 10 Sanders supporters (12%) said the same. That's broadly consistent with what we've seen throughout this primary to date; Sanders has the most committed support, while Biden's has been among the least committed. More on the poll: Among voters with a clear candidate preference or those who had already voted, more than 7 in 10 (72%) Bernie-backers said they \"strongly supported\" him. Among those with preference for Biden that strong support was at 61%. Again, a clear passion/enthusiasm gap there. Biden is still the first choice of black voters, but Sanders \u2014 and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer \u2014 are holding their own. Biden takes 35% among black voters to 20% for Sanders and 19% for Steyer. That's a stunning contrast to the 72 percentage-point margin that Sanders lost black voters to Hillary Clinton by in the 2016 South Carolina primary. For Biden to win, he badly needs to run up the score among black voters \u2014 especially because he is losing whites to Sanders in this poll by 8 points. If Sanders and Steyer can combine to win 4 (or so) out of every 10 black votes in Saturday, Biden's path to victory get rockier. To be clear: Biden still has to be considered the favorite to win on Saturday. He has based his entire campaign on his support in the black community and, more specifically, in the black community in South Carolina. And he's still ahead, according to this NBC-Marist poll as well as plenty of the other available data. Rep. Richmond, Biden campaign National Co-Chair, says they'll win South Carolina: Tonight's debate comes less than a week after the last Democratic debate \u2014 and last week's was the most fiery and contentious\u00a0one yet. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0led a non-stop barrage against Mike Bloomberg, who was appearing on stage for the first time. She kicked it off by calling him an \"arrogant billionaire\" who \"calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians.\"  Amy Klobuchar\u00a0accused Bloomberg of \"hiding behind his TV ads,\" and Joe Biden\u00a0hammered him for opposing Obamacare.  Bernie Sanders\u00a0attacked Bloomberg's support for stop-and-frisk policing in his first answer of the night, and Pete Buttigieg called Bloomberg \"a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power.\" The\u00a0pile-on against Bloomberg\u00a0came three days before the Nevada caucuses, as candidates trailing Sanders, and with nowhere near Bloomberg's money, were desperate to prove they deserve to remain in the race as it narrows. Bernie Sanders\u00a0is the Democratic Party's front-runner headed into tonight's Democratic debate \u2014 and tonight will test how well he wears that crown. This is the final time that the primary field will appear together onstage before \"Super Tuesday\" on March 3, when Sanders could, with victories in\u00a0California\u00a0and\u00a0Texas, claim a runaway lead in the Democratic nomination fight. His rivals know it and, unlike during the last time out in Las Vegas, appear dead set on blunting his momentum. Here's who else is on stage: Former New York Mayor\u00a0Michael Bloomberg\nFormer South Bend, Indiana, Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0\nSen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0\nFormer Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0\nSen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\nBusinessman Tom Steyer"], "Language": false}
