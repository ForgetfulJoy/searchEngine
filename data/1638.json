This basketball player, who goes by the nickname Hot Shot, plays to win. He\u2019s a member of the Harlem Globetrotters, the world\u2019s most famous basketball team.\n\nBorn in the Bronx and raised in Harlem, Swanson is the shortest Harlem Globetrotter in the team\u2019s history. People typically see height as the ultimate advantage in basketball. But players who underestimate Swanson because he is a little person soon regret it.\n\nHe is quick on his feet, a skilled ball handler who can run circles around taller players, and if you let him get a shot off\u2014well, you\u2019re bound to hear a swish.\n\n\u201cI think what people need to realize is that if I wasn\u2019t 4-foot-5, if I was a little taller, it\u2019d be even more scary because with the skills that I have, I think I\u2019d be the best basketball player in the world,\u201d he boasts.\n\nSwanson likes to say he stole his confidence from Michael Jordan. The basketball legend is his idol. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m playing basketball today,\u201d Swanson says. \u201cI just gravitated to Michael Jordan\u2014did everything like him.\u201d\n\nSwanson has been described as mini Michael Jordan, and it\u2019s a description he embraces. But he is his own man on the court. Swanson grew up playing street ball in New York City on some of the toughest public courts, including The Rucker in Harlem and the West Fourth Street Courts in Greenwich Village.\n\nSwanson\u2019s dad, Alfred, who is average height, took his son to basketball courts in various neighborhoods so he could test his skills against different people. \u201cThere\u2019s always somebody that you can learn something from, and I did growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I lost to a kid\u2014that move he did, I would literally go practice that move a thousand times and master it.\u201d\n\nHis mother Sabrina, who is also a little person, showed Swanson how to handle himself when they were out in public and people stared at them for being short in stature. \u201cMy mother would say, \u2018Embrace it. Treat it like paparazzi. Give them something to stare at. Give them something to remember you by, and don\u2019t be afraid to stand up for yourself,\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nAfter honing his skills on a high school team and on public courts, Swanson went on to play basketball for Monroe College in the Bronx and the Beach Warriors, a team in the hyper-competitive Venice Basketball League in Venice, California.\n\nHe is also on the roster of the New York Towers, a squad made up of players with dwarfism. The team dominates the basketball tournament at the Little People of America conventions.\n\nAs a Harlem Globetrotter, Swanson has gone international with his passion, playing games in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, France, the United Kingdom, Venezuela, the Philippines and Canada.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing quite like playing in his hometown in one of the most famous arenas in the world\u2014Madison Square Garden. \u201cI remember my dad taking me to the Knicks games, and I was saying to him as a kid, \u2018I\u2019m going to one day play there,\u2019 \u201d Swanson reminisces. \u201cThen last year, my family is at Madison Square Garden watching me play.\u201d\n\nSwanson is using his success in the sport to inspire others to go after their dreams\u2014no matter what they are. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to show the world that anything you want to do, you can,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m living proof.\u201d"], "Language": false}
