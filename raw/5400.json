Although the United States government is making every effort to provide necessary supplies in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, supplies will only help so much, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said at a town hall for the American Society of Anesthesiologists on Thursday. \u201cWe will not supply our way out of this problem,\u201d he said. The White House Coronavirus Task Force has provided 9 million N95 respirators from the Strategic National Stockpile, and it has worked with manufacturers to increase production of N95 respirators to 100 million a month, according to Adams. He also said the national stockpile purchases 0.1% of all national supplies, while the remaining 99.9% are utilized by commercial and private markets. \u201cA lot of the capacity that folks are looking for is already out there. It\u2019s sitting on shelves in surgery centers. It\u2019s sitting in hospitals. It\u2019s just misaligned,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI really want you all to think about how you can help us fix that misalignment.\u201d Other ways to increase supplies are elimination of elective surgeries and converting anesthesia ventilators to ICU ventilators, according to Adams. He also talked about the importance of testing. \u201cBy this time next week, we expect to be close to two million tests,\u201d he said. Other than provision of medical supplies to areas that need them most, Adams reiterated the importance of the general public taking social distancing and good hygiene practices seriously. According to Adams, the disease runs its course about six to eight weeks after strict social distancing, as seen in China and other parts of Asia. By decreasing the number of infected people, he explained, the demand for supplies would also decrease. \u201cThe way we get out of this crisis is to lower demand,\u201d he said. ##Health## At least 24 detainees at Cook County Jail in Chicago have tested positive for coronavirus, the sheriff's office said in a statement Thursday.  The jail complex currently houses around 5,400 detainees. A total of 89 detainees exhibiting flu-like symptoms have been tested so far. Of those, 24 tested positive, two negative, while an additional 63 have pending test results.  Additionally, nine Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office employees have now tested positive for coronavirus.  Outbreaks have previously been reported in prisons and jails in China, and there have been calls for non-violent prisoners to be released in the US to reduce overcrowding and prevent the spread of the virus among detained populations.  ##Health## CNN's global town hall on the coronavirus town hall has just ended for the night. We talked about the situation in China, Europe, and the US, answered questions from our audiences, and had special guests like Bill Gates and Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky. Here are some of the takeaways: This isn't over yet: The US has not yet peaked, and we won't be able to return to normal life by April, said Bill Gates and top US infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. \nWe need more testing: There is still a lot we don't know about the disease and how long it will last -- but ratcheting up testing and collecting more data will give us a better idea in the coming weeks and months.\nStay vigilant: We all still need to be continuing preventative measures like thoroughly washing our hands, social distancing, and home isolation. \nBut also take care of yourself: Mental health is especially important in times like these, and there are resources in your community or through remote means that can help combat feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and depression.\nWe will recover: The economy is taking a hit, and the nation is facing extraordinary circumstances. But because the economy is on artificial pause, it will likely recover faster than previous recessions, according to CNN anchor and business editor Richard Quest, and the country will be able to go back to normal once we manage to contain the crisis. Scroll through our posts below to catch up on the town hall. Like all Americans, Katie Ledecky has been forced to adjust her lifestyle under self-quarantine as the country struggles against the coronavirus pandemic. Ledecky shared how she is training during this challenging time during an interview on CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday night. \"Yes, so typically I train at\u00a0Stanford.\u00a0I'm a student at Stanford, and\u00a0everything around here is closed\u00a0down in the bay area, all the\u00a0pools, everything.\u00a0During these last couple of\u00a0weeks we've been able to swim in\u00a0some backyard pools, just very\u00a0small groups.\u00a0And really I'm not doing\u00a0anything besides staying in my\u00a0apartment trying to stay in\u00a0shape the best I can.\u00a0But pretty much doing what\u00a0everyone else is, hunkering\u00a0down,\" Ledecky said. One of the motivations for Ledecky to stay in shape are the Olympic games which have been postponed to 2021. \"Goal setting has been crucial to\u00a0me and keeps me motivated every\u00a0day to get out of bed and work\u00a0out hard.\u00a0And I want to represent team USA\u00a0next year and do it really well.\u00a0I think it's going to be really\u00a0cool if everything comes\u00a0together.\u00a0Hopefully that, hopefully we\u00a0can continue to fight this\u00a0disease and reduce the spread\u00a0and be able to compete in Tokyo.\u00a0But I think when we get there,\u00a0it's going to be a true\u00a0celebration of the world being\u00a0able to come together again,\" she said. Watch: ##Health## Countless sporting events have been canceled or postponed around the world over the coronavirus pandemic. The most notable is the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which has been postponed until 2021. It was originally scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9. Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Katie Ledecky joined CNN's ongoing town hall to talk about the postponement. It's \"obviously disappointing, but\u00a0it was certainly the right call,\" she said.\u00a0\"It doesn't really make sense to\u00a0bring everyone from around the\u00a0world together in the middle of\u00a0a pandemic.\" The next steps forward will depend on the new dates for 2021, which will determine the scheduling for trials and training. For now, Ledecky is hunkering down and social distancing like everybody else. \"I'm not doing\u00a0anything besides staying in my\u00a0apartment trying to stay in\u00a0shape the best I can,\" she said. ##Daily Life## The coronavirus pandemic isn't just having a public health and economic toll on the world -- it threatens our mental health, too. But there are things we can do to combat feelings of helplessness, panic, depression, and anxiety, said psychiatrist Dr. Christine Moutier on CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall. Here's one way to change your mindset:  \"Think about what\u00a0you have in your control and\u00a0what you don't have in your\u00a0control.\u00a0Those are facts.\u00a0You can get your head around\u00a0that and you can move towards\u00a0what is actually in your\u00a0control, which actually is a\u00a0lot.\u00a0These are the choices we can\u00a0make for ourselves and our\u00a0families right now.\" If you feel like you want to reach out to a professional for help, but are in self isolation or home quarantine, there are telehealth options and online resources that could offer remote counseling, she added. \"It's a time when people with a\u00a0history of mental health\u00a0conditions need to take\u00a0extra special care of their\u00a0mental health right now.\" With the growing number of coronavirus cases, California is the next New York and New York is the next Italy, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters Thursday.  \"In the same way that New York is now the next Italy, and Italy is the next Iran, and Iran is the next China, no matter where you live, you are the next next, this virus doesn't care where you live,\" said Mayor Garcetti, echoing comments he previously made to CNN. The rate of increase in the number of cases was doubling every three to four days, but today\u2019s number shows a new rate of increase. Cases are now doubling less than every two days and if this rate continues, we will be where New York is today, Garcetti said. \"These are neighbors, these are not statistics. These are the loved ones that are in our families and our communities and our workplaces,\" Garcetti added. The mayor also announced that the city is partnering with fashion brand Reformation to help produce masks with guidance from health care company Kaiser Permanente. The city has launched LA Projects to collaborate with garment and apparel manufacturers to mass produce non-medical masks for non-medical staff at hospitals, grocery workers, and other Angelenos on the front lines. The goal is to produce 5 million non-medical masks, Garcetti said. ##Daily Life## Earlier this week, Hawaii Governor David Ige asked people to postpone their visits to the state for 30 days, and most people are listening.  In a Thursday evening press conference, Ige said flights to Hawaii this week are down 87% compared to the same week in 2019. \"We must try to stop visitors from coming to Hawaii in order to stop the spread of Covid-19 into our communities,\u201d Gov. Ige said The state is backing up its request for fewer visitors with an order that all arrivals -- residents and visitors -- immediately enter a 14-day quarantine upon entering the state. Visitors must spend that time in their hotel room at their own expense, or face a possible criminal charge if they ignore the order. \u201cOnly 38 total people flew into Kauai's airport (Thursday),\u201d said Tim Sakahara with the state\u2019s Department of Transportation. Arrivals are interviewed before being allowed to leave the airport, and must fill out a form giving details on where they will be spending their quarantine. Gov. Ige says they are also working with the US Army Corps of Engineers to find places where a field hospital could be set up if one is necessary. A site survey already has been done at the exhibition hall of Hawaii Convention Center, according to Ige. ##Travel## China confirmed 55 new cases of the coronavirus Thursday, bringing the total number of active cases to 3,292. The majority of those, 2,896, are in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected late last year.  Of the new cases, all but one were imported, China's National Health Commission said.  Five more deaths were also recorded, all in Hubei province, four of which were in the provincial capital Wuhan. The country has recorded 3,292 deaths in total related to the virus. China's national reported number of confirmed cases -- which includes both active cases and people who have recovered -- now stands at 81,340, behind the United States, which has now confirmed over 82,000 cases.  The Trump administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency is indefinitely dialing back enforcement of regulations and fines for companies during the coronavirus pandemic. The EPA announced the policy Thursday, citing worker shortages, social distancing needs and travel restrictions for both agency employees and contractors as a result of the pandemic. \"EPA is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from Covid-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements,\" EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. While pulling back from enforcement, EPA says it expects public water systems not to relax their standards. \"Public water systems have a heightened responsibility to protect public health because unsafe drinking water can lead to serious illnesses and access to clean water for drinking and handwashing is critical during the Covid-19 pandemic,\" the agency said in a memo. Environmental groups, who have been fighting EPA pollution regulation rollbacks since Trump took office, objected to Thursday\u2019s announcement. \"This is an open license to pollute. Plain and simple,\" said Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator under President Barack Obama and now president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. The administration, McCarthy said, \"is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health.\" The move, which is retroactive to March 13, \"does not provide leniency for intentional criminal violations,\" EPA says, and doesn\u2019t apply to Superfund and other hazardous and solid waste management. ##Daily Life## ##Business## Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has asked the European Council for a concrete financial plan to overcome the novel coronavirus pandemic. The European Council is a collective body that helps to shape the European Union's overall priorities. Sanchez demanded the council provide \"a clear and compelling financial commitment to overcome the crisis,\" including \"concrete proposals for medium and long-term financing,\" according to a statement from the Spanish government.   On Thursday, EU member states gathered on an extraordinary G20 video-conference on COVID-19 to discuss a shared front in dealing with the socio-economic impact of the pandemic.  Italy and Spain, however, refused to sign the EU's joint response to COVID-19 after they disagreed with the economic proposals put forward during Thursday's leadership summit, a spokesperson for the European Council told CNN. \"Spain and Italy had problems with the parts of the statement tackling social-economic consequences,\" the spokesperson said. The EU agreed to come back with a new proposal in two weeks, according to the Spanish press note. This week, Sanchez and eight other European leaders sent a letter to the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, explaining \"the need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European institution\" to benefit all member states on the same basis with long-term finance policies to counteract the damage caused by the pandemic. ##Business## ##Daily Life## If you're hoping to return to normal life, work, and social gatherings by April, be prepared to bunker down for a lot longer, warned Bill Gates at the ongoing CNN town hall on the coronavirus pandemic.  An April resuming of life is \"not realistic.\u00a0The numbers are still going up.\u00a0That only happens after the\u00a0numbers have peaked and are\u00a0going down a lot and getting\u00a0down to an absolute level,\" he said. That's not to say we haven't made progress: Vaccine trials are underway, and with the right measures, these shutdowns and extreme restrictions could come to an end, he said. But schools will likely stay closed for the rest of the school year, and \"the light\u00a0is not at the end of the tunnel\u00a0in terms of a mid-April\u00a0reopening,\" he added.  So far, not a single state has reached the crucial point where case numbers are plateauing and beginning to decrease -- meaning it is unlikely we have reached the peak yet. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Bill Gates believes social distancing is crucially important in reducing the spread of coronavirus. The Microsoft founder and philanthropist shared his thoughts about social isolation Thursday night during CNN's coronavirus town hall. \"It is super\u00a0painful to drive this very high\u00a0degree of social isolation I\u00a0call shutdown.\u00a0The middle course really isn't\u00a0there because it's hard to say,\u00a0oh, go back to the theater for a\u00a0week maybe or maybe not you'll\u00a0be infected or infecting people,\" Gates said. \n\"Until we get the certainty we've\u00a0hit these low numbers, you know,\u00a0I doubt even if you told people\u00a0that they should be buying new\u00a0houses and cars and hanging out\u00a0in restaurants, I doubt they're\u00a0going to want to do that.\u00a0People want to protect older\u00a0people.\" ##Health## ##Daily Life## Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates joined CNN's global town hall to speak about the coronavirus pandemic and what needs to be done. He's been warning about the risks of a pandemic for years. Back in 2015, during a TED Talk, he warned that the greatest threat we face isn't nuclear war, but a pandemic.  Since then, he has called for more funding in pandemic preparation, vaccine and diagnostic development, and simulation training -- but \"not much has happened.\"  \"This is kind of the nightmare\u00a0scenario,\" he said of the coronavirus pandemic. Other countries have done better than the US: The countries hard hit by SARS in 2003, like those in Asia, \"are the ones that have done best in this epidemic because they acted when the number of cases were still very, very small,\" Gates said. The US response, in contrast, has been slow and chaotic, he added. We might be better off now if we had \"behaved a\u00a0little bit like the countries\u00a0that have done the best on this\u00a0one.\" And it's not over yet. \"We have not peaked,\" he warned, calling for more dramatic lockdowns to prevent further infections and deaths. \"Basically the whole\u00a0country needs to do what was\u00a0done in the part of China where\u00a0they had these infections,\" he added. Watch: ##Health## R. Kelly\u2019s attorneys have filed a motion asking for the singer to be released on bond because, they argue, Kelly is within the group that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has categorized as \"most-at-risk for contracting COVID-19.\" \"The health risk to Mr. Kelly, because of his age and because of the multiple surgeries he has undergone -- including a recent surgery while incarcerated -- coupled with the conditions at the MCC (Metropolitan Correctional Center) as described below, necessitates his temporary release on bail until this pandemic has ended,\" his lawyers said in a statement.  Kelly\u2019s lawyers say that if bond were granted, he would be placed on home incarceration and would be electronically monitored. The singer is currently being detained at the Chicago MCC where he is awaiting trial for multiple sexual abuse charges. Getting underneath the finger nails is an important part of thorough hand-washing needed to stave off coronavirus, according to Dr. Sanjay Gupta who provided viewers a tutorial Thursday night during CNN's coronavirus town hall. One of the other important details Gupta shared was making sure every wash lasts as long as it would take to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice, he said.  Watch: ##Daily Life## The United States now has more reported coronavirus cases than any other country in the world. According to CNN Health\u2019s tally of US cases, there are at least\u00a082,079\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States. Some\u00a01,195\u00a0people have died. The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases. ##Health## The $2 billion stimulus bill does include financial relief for independent contractors, according to CNN's Richard Quest. Quest discussed the details of the stimulus package Thursday night during CNN's coronavirus town hall. The discussion was prompted by a question from viewer Cheryl O'Brien. \"Yes, in general, during the\u00a0period individuals who operate\u00a0under a sole partnership or as\u00a0an independent contractor shall\u00a0be eligible for a covered loan. Now, it\u2019s not a grant, it\u2019s a\u00a0loan.\u00a0From what I\u2019ve been hearing,\u00a0people trying to get in touch\u00a0with authorities, it\u2019s a lot of\u00a0bureaucracy getting through.\u00a0But yes, Cheryl, sole\u00a0proprietors and independent\u00a0contractors are covered as if\u00a0they were employees,\" Quest said. ##Stimulus Bill## The US economy and markets worldwide have been slammed by the coronavirus pandemic, with people halting work, businesses closing, and certain industries like aviation and food service hit particularly hard. The economy is in recession\u2014 but it's temporary, and will recover, said CNN anchor and business editor Richard Quest on CNN's ongoing town hall. In 2008, the national recession lasted all four quarters \u2014 \"but we don't expect anything\u00a0like that this time round for\u00a0the simple reason that the economy\u00a0has been artificially stopped\u00a0and it will be started up again\u00a0hopefully in the second quarter\u00a0at some point,\" Quest said. \"By Q3, you should be seeing a\u00a0recovery.\" He warned that tens of thousands of businesses may fail in the coming quarters \u2014 but recovery will return. \"But for most people in work,\u00a0when their companies restart,\u00a0they will be taken back in\u00a0again.\u00a0The economy will get back up and\u00a0running again.\u00a0I think by next year, by the\u00a0beginning of next year, you'll be\u00a0looking at good growth,\" he said. ##Business## D Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, joined CNN's town hall tonight to address the coronavirus pandemic. He also answered questions from viewers concerned about the outbreak. Here are some of those questions and his responses: Q: Why is the President suggesting a pullback when numbers are rising so rapidly? \"I think what the\u00a0President was trying to do, he\u00a0was making an aspirational\u00a0projection to give people some\u00a0hope,\" Fauci said. \n\"When you have a\u00a0situation when the cases today\u00a0compared to tomorrow is\u00a0increased dramatically and then\u00a0the next day is increased\u00a0dramatically, that's no time to\u00a0pull back.\u00a0That's when you have to hunker\u00a0down, nail down, mitigate,\u00a0mitigate, mitigate, get the\u00a0people taken care of.\" Q: At what point will we have a better idea of a timeline for the US? We have a lot more information now than just a few weeks ago, said Fauci \u2014 but there's still one thing that makes it difficult to tell where the pandemic will go and how long it will last in the US.\nThis is the relative percentage of asymptomatic infection \u2014 and it \"influences everything,\" Fauci said. It influences transmission, contact tracing, and the measures that the authorities need to take. That's why the most important thing to do now is to conduct widespread testing and collect more data.\nThe contact tracing and testing we're doing isn't enough at the moment, he warned. \"It needs to be ratcheted up ... we've got to do it\u00a0better than we are now.\" Watch: ##Health## Spain reached a grim milestone this week with more than 4,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported. This spike has resulted in the country transforming an ice skating rink into a makeshift morgue to help relieve the pressure on hospitals and medical facilities, according to CNN's Scott McLean. McLean shared this insight during CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday evening.  \"The reason that this ice rink\u00a0started to be used in the first\u00a0place is because the city\u00a0state-run funeral service\u00a0stopped picking up the bodies of\u00a0coronavirus patients because\u00a0they said they didn\u2019t have\u00a0enough protective equipment,\" McLean said. \n\"Now the issue is more that there\u00a0simply isn\u2019t enough space in the\u00a0city morgues to store all of\u00a0these bodies given the backlog\u00a0of bodies waiting to be buried\u00a0or cremated so they have to come\u00a0somewhere, and obviously this\u00a0ice rink is a suitable place for\u00a0them.\u00a0The problem is particularly\u00a0acute here, because more than\u00a0half of all the coronavirus\u00a0deaths in this country have been\u00a0here in Madrid.\" Over the past 24 hours, McLean said Spain has reported 650 deaths. That brings the total to more than 4,300, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. ##Health## The pandemic began in mainland China last December \u2014 but now, the country is seeing close to zero new local transmissions each day, as the situation worsens elsewhere around the world. The country is beginning to lift travel restrictions and strict lockdowns that have been in place for months \u2014 but people are still cautious. \"As you start to ease\u00a0restrictions ... you're going to have people\u00a0moving around starting to resume\u00a0life,\" said CNN's International Correspondent David Culver. \"Will that cause numbers to go\u00a0back up?\u00a0It is something they're mindful\u00a0of here.\u00a0Even the residents we've spoken\u00a0with have quite\u00a0frankly told us as soon as the\u00a0gates open, so to speak, they\u00a0are in no rush to get out of\u00a0their homes after 70-plus days\u00a0of lockdown.\" As the pandemic hits the US and Europe particularly hard, there are also rising fears in China of a second wave of imported cases from overseas, similar to the one being seen in Hong Kong. \"That's why they have now\u00a0essentially banned all foreign\u00a0travelers into mainland\u00a0China,\" Culver said.\u00a0\"You go back a few weeks,\u00a0it was the rest of the world\u00a0that was really concerned with\u00a0travelers coming from China.\u00a0Now it's China really worried\u00a0about travelers coming from\u00a0every other country.\" ##Daily Life## Venezuela has confirmed the first death due to novel coronavirus in the country, according to a televised statement by Vice President Delcy Rodriguez on Thursday. The victim was a 47-year-old male that passed in the northern state of Aragua, Rodriguez said. Venezuela has confirmed 107 cases of coronavirus. Neighboring Colombia has 491 cases and six deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins. The worst outbreak in South America is in Brazil, which has confirmed 2,985 cases and 77 deaths.  ##Health## ##Travel## Many members of the US House of Congress are scrambling to book flights and return to Washington amid concerns that they could be forced to show up in person and vote on the stimulus, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The fear is that one member could prevent the House from approving the bill by voice vote, forcing them instead to cast a roll-call vote in person. That has angered many members worried about traveling during the public health emergency. On a conference call with Democratic members today, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that if they are unable to pass the bill by voice vote Friday, then they would have a roll call vote Friday on final passage, according to three sources on the call. Several members told CNN there was ample confusion since House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer previously indicated to members that any roll-call vote would occur Saturday instead. That means members who want to cast a vote on the historic measure need to show up tomorrow to have their position recorded. On Capitol Hill, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie is viewed as the most likely member to try to force the vote, after indicating publicly his reservations for letting the bill pass by voice. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN Wednesday she might force a recorded vote, but Democrats don\u2019t believe she will. Neither Massie nor Ocasio-Cortez responded to requests for comment Thursday. ##Stimulus Bill## At least 24 states reported over 100 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, as the US overtook China and Italy to have more confirmed infections than anywhere else in the world.  The worst outbreak continues to be in New York, which reported at least 6,447 new cases. That was followed by New Jersey, with 2,492, and Washington state with 627 new cases. Illinois confirmed 673 new cases, Massachusetts 579, and Michigan 561. Full list of states reporting over 100 cases today: New York 6,447\nNew Jersey 2,492\nWashington 627\nIllinois 673\nMassachusetts 579\nMichigan 561\nPennsylvania 560\nLouisiana 510\nCalifornia 471\nTexas 422\nFlorida 378\nColorado 344\nTennessee 173\nIndiana 168\nOhio 163\nMaryland 157\nMissouri 146\nGeorgia 138\nConnecticut 137\nNorth Carolina 132\nWisconsin 122\nAlabama 120\nMississippi 108\nArizona 107 ##Health## CNN is about to kick off its coronavirus town hall about the facts and fears surrounding this pandemic.  We'll hear from CNN correspondents covering the situation on the ground, as well as from Bill Gates, health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Katie Ledecky. We'll be covering the event live here. It will air on CNN, CNN International, across mobile devices via CNN's apps for iOS and Android, and on CNNgo apps. The per-capita number of coronavirus cases in the US is almost four times that of China, based on most recent population estimates.\u00a0 Based on CNN's count Thursday evening, the US now has 81,836 cases for a country with an estimated population of just over 328 million. That's about one case for every 4,010 people. China's number is similar, 81,782, but for a country four times larger in population. Current United Nations estimates put China's population at over 1.4 billion. That's about one case for every 17,582 people. China typically reports new nationwide case totals around 9 p.m. ET, so the comparison could soon change. ##Health## Actor Mark Blum, known for his roles in the movies \"Desperately Seeking Susan\" and \"Crocodile Dundee,\" died due to complications from Covid-19, according to a statement released by the Screen Actors Guild.\u00a0He was 69. \u201cThis is a painful loss to our SAG-AFTRA family,\u201d SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement. \u201cMark Blum understood that all performers working in this industry share the same employers and that our strength depends on our unity. He was a visionary. Mark will be deeply missed, and our hearts go out to his wife, Janet Zarish, his friends and all of his loved ones,\" Carteris added. ##Health## At least 365 people have died from Covid-19 across New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a tweet Thursday.\u00a0 About 23,112 people have tested positive for coronavirus, he said. These numbers are up from what the mayor reported during a news conference earlier Thursday. \u201cThe next few months will be painful and stress our health care system like never before,\" de Blasio's tweet said. Read the tweet: ##Health## Hilton, one of the largest US hotel brands, announced Thursday much of its corporate staff will have reduced schedules or be furloughed up to 90 days, according to a statement. CNN reported earlier that the company\u2019s corporate staff was bracing for the announcement. Furloughed employees will maintain health benefits and will also be eligible for unemployment benefits, according the statement.

A second official said if there is a large number of additional cases, the Defense Department would be unlikely to publicly specify how many of the Navy\u2019s overall cases are members of the crew, out of concerns that adversaries China or North Korea could see the ship as vulnerable. Despite the outbreak, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday said in a statement, \"We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region.\" Earlier in the day, acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly had said there were \"several\" more cases onboard the ship, but did not give a specific number. \"We are in the process now of testing 100% of the crew of that ship to ensure that we're able to contain whatever spread might've occurred,\" Modly told reporters at the Pentagon at a briefing Thursday morning.  There are approximately 5,000 personnel onboard the carrier. Some context: The Roosevelt is in the process of pulling into Guam, according to Modly. \"No one on the crew will be allowed to leave anywhere into Guam, other than on pier side,\" he said. The ship was last in port in Vietnam more than two weeks ago. It is not clear where the sailors initially contracted the virus. The Navy is now in the process of flying all personnel off the ship. ##Health## Plastic face shields are the only personal protective item currently out of stock in Los Angeles County, according to Health Services Director Dr. Christina Ghaly. \u201cThe stockpile has been distributed, those supplies come in on a daily basis,\" she added about the city's personal protective equipment.

Smith said the increase is placing pressure on ICU capacity, and that operating rooms have been converted to ICUs, and an entire 36-bed floor has been renovated to be converted to ICU space. Smith said a call went out yesterday for doctors to volunteer to staff ICUs and within a few hours, 20 surgeons volunteered. ##Health## Montana is the latest state to order all of its citizens to stay home except for essential work and limited outdoor activities.\u00a0 The order goes into effect on March 28. \"With 90 cases in our state today... we have to do more to curtail the spread of this virus,\" Gov. Steve Bullock said at a news conference Thursday to announce his emergency order. \u201cI'd rather be accused of overreacting than to have our health care system overwhelmed,\u201d Bullock added at the briefing in Helena. \u201cIn order to have a healthy economy, we need to have a health population.\u201d ##Health## ##Daily Life## Chicago and Detroit are demonstrating a concerning spread of coronavirus, Dr. Deborah Birx said at Thursday\u2019s White House briefing. \u201cWe are concerned about certain counties\u201d that have seen increased spreading of the virus, Birx said, naming Wayne County, Michigan, (home to Detroit) and Cook County, Illinois, (home of Chicago) as examples. She said those locations were showing a \u201cmore rapid increase\u201d of spread. Forty percent of the country has \u201cextraordinarily low rates\u201d of coronavirus, Birx said. And 55% of all cases are in the New York and New Jersey area, she said.\u00a0 Birx also noted that 19 states currently have fewer than 200 cases, noting those states have been conducting tests, and that the low numbers are not because those states have not been testing.\u00a0 \u201cThere is no reality on the ground that 60-70% of Americans will get infected in the next 8-12 weeks,\" Birx said. Despite multiple daily reports of shortages of supplies like personal protective equipment and the growing need for ventilators at hospitals nationwide, Birx insisted that most areas will have access to hospital beds or ventilators if they need them.\u00a0 \u201cTo say that to the American\u00a0people to make the implication\u00a0that when they need a hospital bed it\u2019s not going to be there, or when they need that\u00a0ventilator it\u2019s not going to be there,\u00a0we don't have an evidence of that\u00a0right now,\"\u00a0Birx said. \u201cAnd it's our job collectively to assure the\u00a0American people of that. It\u2019s our collective job to make sure\u00a0that doesn't happen.\u201d ##Health## President Trump, when asked what steps he is taking to stop hate crimes against Asian Americans, said he didn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d and added that \u201call I know is Asian Americans are doing fantastically well.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump initially said when asked what steps he was taking but added that his tweet earlier in the week \u201cwas a very important tweet to me, and I didn\u2019t like some things I was hearing.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTo me, Asian Americans are a great part of our country,\u201d Trump said Thursday in the briefing room. Trump also said of Asian Americans; \u201cI\u2019m very close to them. They\u2019re doing fantastically well. I think they appreciate the job we\u2019re doing.\" On Tuesday, Trump said that he had decided to pull back from associating the novel coronavirus with China, which he had previously done by calling it the \"China\u00a0virus\" or the \"Chinese\u00a0virus.\" \"Look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it,\" Trump told Fox News. \"I think I've made a big deal. I think people understand it.\"\u00a0 The President said he didn't regret using the terms to describe the\u00a0virus\u00a0and defended his past adoption of the terms by referencing other infectious diseases that are named after where they originate. \"It came from China,\" he said.\u00a0 When the virus was officially named, WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that \"having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.\" Separately, Trump said he would be speaking with China's President Xi Jinping Thursday evening.\u00a0 President Trump warmed up to the concept of having cruise companies register in the US and pay US taxes in order to receive relief from the federal government for the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.\u00a0 Many cruise lines are incorporated overseas,\u00a0meaning the lines can avoid many US federal taxes, and US labor laws.\u00a0 Royal Caribbean's global\u00a0headquarters are in Miami but the corporation is incorporated in Liberia, while Carnival Cruise Lines is\u00a0incorporated in Panama. Their ships also fly the flags of those\u00a0countries meaning employees working\u00a0on board\u00a0can be paid far less than US minimum wages.  \u201cI do like the concept of perhaps coming in and registering here, coming into the United States. You know it\u2019s very difficult to make a loan to a company when they\u2019re based in a different country,\u201d Trump said Thursday in the White House briefing room, before adding that the industry employs a large number of Americans at domestic ports. Trump said his administration would \u201cmaybe really look at that very seriously.\u201d ##Business## President Donald Trump said he will speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping Thursday night about coronavirus. He suggested the administration does not believe all the data coming out of China \u2014 despite his previous praise of how Xi has handled the outbreak. Asked about projections that the US could overtake China in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, Trump said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a tribute to our testing.\u201d \u201cNumber one, you don\u2019t know what the numbers are in China,\u201d Trump said. He added that he would be speaking to Xi later Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that\u2019s a little hard.\u201d Watch: ##Health## At least 237 additional coronavirus deaths were recorded on Thursday across the United States, according to CNN's reporting.

Trump also said more information will come early next week in terms of his plans.\u00a0 Some context: Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Wednesday night \"You don't make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline,\" when asked how long\u00a0the novel coronavirus could affect daily life in the US.\u00a0\u00a0 \"You've got to be realistic,\"\u00a0Fauci\u00a0told CNN Wednesday. ##Health## President Trump thanked both Democrats and Republicans for unanimously passing the $2 trillion stimulus package in the Senate.  \u201cI am profoundly grateful that both parties\u00a0came together to provide relief\u00a0for American workers and\u00a0families in this hour of need,\" Trump said Thursday.

The US Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing the contract which is being funded via \u201c\u00a0Fiscal 2020 defense emergency response funds.\u201d Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said this earlier this week that he anticipates the field hospitals being used to temporarily alleviate the strain on civilian hospitals in order to allow the US Army Corps of Engineers to retrofit hotels, convention centers and college dormitories into makeshift hospitals.  \u201cHow I foresee our hospitals being used is during the early stages of the pandemic, the virus hitting a city where they're still trying to ramp up capability, bed space, we can come in for a short period of time, for a few weeks to provide that capacity until they get either gyms converted, hotels converted, college dorms converted, all those things that the Corps of Engineers is working on right now,\" Esper said. ##Business## ##Health## \u00a0 \u00a0 New York City will have 2,500 more ventilators than they had 10 days ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday during a news conference.

Pelosi, along with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and a number of other rank-and-file\u00a0were blunt about their preference for the vote to occur by voice Friday, rather than an in-person roll-call vote.\u00a0 Several members expressed concerns about traveling amid the coronavirus pandemic, noting they have health issues or live with someone with health concerns. Others noted their challenges in traveling back to Washington, DC.  At least 10 members expressed their concerns on the call, noting that the bill will pass regardless so it makes little sense to potentially endanger members' health or their families' health, one of the sources said. Any House member can request a recorded vote Friday during consideration of the stimulus bill, which would mean the House would have to hold a vote by Monday with members returning to the Capitol to cast the vote. If no one requests a recorded vote, the bill can quickly be approved by voice vote Friday, with few members present. At least two lawmakers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Thomas Massie, have not ruled out requesting a recorded vote because of their concerns with the bill. ##Stimulus Bill## Megabus has suspended all service in and out of New York City through April 9, according to the company's website.

But at about 8 p.m. that day, he stripped off his face mask and snapped a quick selfie, something he rarely does. \"I mainly took the photo for two reasons. Firstly, to send it to my partner, to tell her that I had finished my shift at work and that I was on my way home, slightly bruised,\" Sgarbi told CNN over email. \"Secondly, to show it to my 1-year-old daughter when she will have grown up.

Overall, small business groups are pleased some assistance is coming.

The provisions are also unlikely to save those small businesses that will have to come up with cash to stay afloat until they can actually get the government's aid money in hand. \"There's no way many can keep going,\" said John Arensmeyer, CEO of Small Business Majority, a national small business advocacy group.

That would ensure that most House members would not have to return to Washington. But if any member requests a recorded vote, then House members would have to return at a later date to cast a roll call vote. So far, at least two members, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Thomas Massie, have not ruled out requesting a recorded vote. What happens next: House GOP leaders plan to walk through the stimulus bill with their members on a 1:30 p.m. conference call today, according to a Republican source. House Democratic leaders will have their own caucus call at 3 p.m., according to a Democratic source. These calls will be important to ensure leaders have cooperation from their rank-and-file to allow the bill to pass by voice vote Friday morning \u2014 rather than requiring all members to come back to vote in person.  How the vote will happen: On Friday, the House will convene at 9 a.m. Then there will be time for a debate, equally divided between the two sides. And then they will proceed to a voice vote. Once the presiding officer says the \"ayes\" have it, the bill will be passed \u2014 unless a member requests a recorded vote. It's unclear how many members will show for Friday's debate and voice vote \u2014 it can be very few, or it can be a lot, there is no requirement. Also, at his news conference today, McCarthy made clear the House will look different than it usually does in order to promote social distancing. He said the members won't sit next each other, they'll alter where the members stand, and staff will be cleaning as members come and go. He also said that members will have to enter one designated door and leave out the other. ##Stimulus Bill## Honduras\u2019 health ministry announced on Thursday the country\u2019s first novel coronavirus-related death.

The House speaker also appeared to push back on President Trump\u2019s push in recent days to end social distancing by Easter Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve said from the start that we must have a proposal that\u2019s government-wide, science-based, so that we can really address the challenge that we face in a scientific, evidence-based way. That is not necessarily the course that has been advocated by some, but it\u2019s where we must be if we\u2019re going to end this,\u201d Pelosi said. ##Stimulus Bill## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the Senate-passed $2 trillion economic stimulus bill, saying it does nothing to help local and state governments fight the coronavirus pandemic. \"I believe what they did failed to meet the governmental need,\" he said at a news conference today. \"I find it reckless.\" Cuomo said he would give congressional leaders \"a piece\u00a0of my mind\" after the coronavirus outbreak has passed, but now he's focused on the pandemic response. \"I promise you\u00a0I'm going to give them a piece\u00a0of my mind, but I would say to\u00a0them today, this is an\u00a0extraordinary time in this\u00a0nation, and it's an\u00a0extraordinary time for\u00a0government.\u00a0This was the time to put\u00a0politics aside and partisanship\u00a0aside.\" \"Do your job,\" he told Congress. The US Senate passed a $2 trillion economic relief package. It goes to the House next. ##Stimulus Bill## \u00a0G20 Leaders said they are committed to do whatever it takes to overcome the coronavirus pandemic.  In a statement released after a virtual meeting hosted by Saudi Arabia, the G20 said it would spare no effort to protect lives, safeguard people\u2019s jobs and preserve financial stability.  The G20 members have committed to injecting over $5 trillion into the global economy, the leaders said in the statement. It also gave support to the \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d taken by central banks and bodies like the IMF and World Bank.  The statement did not outline any new or specific measures the G20 was taking, but said leaders were ready \u201cto react promptly and take any further action that may be required.\u201d ##Health##\u00a0 Two people who were passengers on the Grand Princess Cruise have died due to coronavirus, according to a statement from US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThe staff from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) working with quarantined cruise ship passengers housed at Travis Air Force Base in California is deeply saddened by the recent deaths of two passengers due to complications from the coronavirus. Both passengers were on board the Grand Princess cruise ship and were transferred to area medical facilities immediately after developing COVID-19 symptoms. One person passed away March 21, and the other passed away on March 23. Grief support for both families is being provided by HHS and Princess Cruise Lines. Our heartfelt condolences to both families,\u201d according to the statement. The Grand Princess, which was carrying 3,500 passengers and crew members, docked at the Port of Oakland earlier this month after at least 21 people\u00a0tested positive for coronavirus.  The cruise, a 2-week trip from San Francisco to Hawaii, was interrupted after officials learned a California man contracted coronavirus and died on a previous trip. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says she sent a request to President Trump for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would allow the state to provide rental assistance and temporary housing to people in the state, counseling and therapy for residents, and the ability to quickly set up field hospitals or other facilities to treat coronavirus patients. Whitmer reminded people that the stay-at-home executive order is not optional and is not an opportunity for people to throw a party for 10 of their closest friends. They are meant to stay at home with whom the family members they live.\u00a0 She said she is working to secure more equipment and supplies and reiterated her comments about how the allotment of personal protective equipment for one of the hospitals was not enough to cover a full shift. The Greater New York Chamber of Commerce says the $2 trillion stimulus package is \"too little too late.\" \"As of now, no one has received any money. It\u2019s all talk, while people need relief now!\u00a0Small business is being crushed and even unemployment is slow getting money out to people who need it the most.\u00a0If the politicians were not getting a paycheck; you can bet the relief would already be here,\" said Mark Jaffe, CEO of the Greater New York Chamber. The Greater New York Chamber of Commerce represents 30,000 businesses and civic leaders. New York State had 80,000 unemployment claims last week \u2013 up 66,000 from the week prior. Collin Arnold, director of the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said coronavirus \u201cis going to be the disaster that\u2019s going to define our generation.\u201d Arnold told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto that the city needs more personal protective equipment and ventilators for hospitals, but also could face a food supply shortage. Food banks today have enough food to last only another two days, he says. The situation in Louisiana: There have been 827 coronavirus cases and 37 deaths in Orleans Parish.\u00a0Arnold said Mardi Gras celebrations likely contributed to the spread of the virus.\u00a0President Trump on Wednesday approved an urgent request for a major disaster declaration for Louisiana, which now grants the state access to federal aid as it combats the spread of Covid-19. Watch more: India, the world's second most populated country after China, is delaying the first phase of the national census as well as the National Population Register (NPR) due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the Ministry of Home Affairs confirmed via an official Twitter account for Census of India 2021. Both the first phase of census and the NPR were initially meant to be carried out from April 1 to September 30. On Tuesday night, the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi ordered a 21-day nationwide lockdown starting at midnight Wednesday. The Ministry of Home Affairs cited that lockdown and said both the first phase of census and NPR will be delayed until further notice India conducts the census once every decade. The first census was in 1872, when India was under British rule. The exercise is essentially a population headcount which serves as a primary source for a variety of statistics on the country's demography, literacy, migration, mortality, economy and culture. The NPR has been a contentious.\u00a0Back in 2018\u00a0its publication in India's northeast border state of Assam left the names of almost 4 million people off the controversial registry list, effectively casting a shadow over their citizenship. ##Daily Life## The acting Navy secretary said the hospital ship USNS Comfort would reach New York \u201chopefully\u2026 by the early part of next week\u201d after the Defense Department \u201caccelerated\u201d their deployment plan. \u201cWe had been originally looking at April 3, but in all likelihood, she\u2019s going to be getting underway this weekend,\u201d said Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly to reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m actually going to be going down there to the ship either tomorrow or Saturday.

Top Spanish health official Fernando Sim\u00f3n also tentatively noted signs of a peak in the data, answering a question from CNN in the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing.\u00a0 Taking into account the delay in the data from the time of transmission and then getting symptoms and being diagnosed, Sim\u00f3n said \u201cthe rate of increase is stabalizing\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an indicator that the peak of the curve with respect to the total diagnoses is approaching,\u201d Sim\u00f3n said \u2014 though he noted they would have to continue to monitor the data to confirm this. Some context: Health officials had said they expected to see a peak in the rate of increase of infections Spain this week. However, there had been little signs of this on Wednesday when Spain\u2019s death toll overtook China\u2019s. ##Health## New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says the state has 4,400 positive tests and 62 deaths. The numbers are up because of community spread and because testing facilities are open, he said. \u201cWe are all in on stay at home,\u201d the governor told local radio program Hot 97 Ebro in the Morning. \u201cThere is hope on the horizon we just don\u2019t know when that is, but hope for the best but prepare for the worst let\u2019s not be fooling each other right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a war.\u201d On federal help, Murphy said\u00a0\u201cI need him, I need the Vice President, we need the federal government, we need the White House.\u201d The White House team for the most part has been \u201cgood\u201d to deal with, Murphy said. The White House helped approve standing up four field hospitals that the Army Corps and FEMA are setting up for the state, he added. He said the state is \u201cdesperately short\u201d of Personal protective equipment noting the government has already given 2 installments \u201c but we need a lot more.\u201d With regards to Trump's optimism about being able to slowly open up around April 12, Murphy said,\u00a0\u201cI'll be the happiest guy in New Jersey, maybe in America, if that\u2019s the case but I sadly think the data is suggesting to us we\u2019re not going to be there.\u201d He said of the stimulus package \u201cit\u2019s a big deal\u201d adding but \u201cit\u2019s not everything\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re hemorrhaging money as a state, because we\u2019re at the front lines helping folks who are sick out of work small businesses etc,\" he said. A supervisor at the Laredo North Border Patrol station has tested positive for coronavirus, and \u201cat least 15 other agents\u201d were sent home to self-quarantine on safety leave after potentially being exposed to the disease, according to a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Union.\u00a0 The supervisor worked for the K-9 at the Laredo North Station, according to union Vice President Hector Garza. The agents are not being identified to protect their identities, Garza said. According to the union, the \u201cspouse of a supervising agent in Laredo\u201c tested positive for the virus first earlier this week. The supervisor worked \u201ca whole shift\u201d on March 23, before receiving news of their spouse\u2019s test and going home to quarantine, Garza said.

On Tuesday evening, Garza posted a message on the local union\u2019s Facebook page asking for anyone to who believes they may have been exposed to the virus to come forward and get tested.\u00a0 CNN has not heard back from Border Patrol with a statement about the incident.\u00a0CBP, in general, has declined to confirm cases among its employees, unlike other DHS components such as the TSA. Ford Motor announced on Thursday that it will restart production \"at key North American plants.\" According to a news release, the company will introduce additional safety measures to protect workers as they reopen as soon as April 6.

Obviously there are people who have jobless claims, and again, the good thing about this bill is the President is protecting these people, so you know, now with these plans, small businesses, hopefully will be able to hire back a lot of those people. Last week they didn\u2019t know if they had any protections, they didn\u2019t have any cash, they had no choice,\" he said\u00a0during a call-in appearance on CNBC.\u00a0 Mnuchin continued: \"Now with this bill passed by Congress, there are protections. And as I said, hopefully these workers will be rehired, but between these three programs it protects all American workers. And by the way, you know, lots of big, big companies do continue to hire for obviously grocery stores, pharmacies, you know, delivery services. These companies are on overtime, so I know they are hiring people as fast as they can.\"\u00a0 ##Business## US stocks opened higher on Thursday despite the worst jobless claims data in history, suggesting the market had already priced in a shock to the US labor market. The Department of Labor showed nearly 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. Here's how the markets opened: The Dow opened up 1.3%, or 275 points.\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite kicked off 1.1% higher. \u00a0All three indexes extended their gains in the first minutes of trading. \u00a0##Business## As of\u00a0Thursday morning, there are 280 US service members who have tested positive for Covid-19.\u00a0This is an increase of 53 from 227 on Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0 There is now nearly 600\u00a0positive cases across the US Department of Defense. ##Health## Mexico will begin suspending non-essential\u00a0federal government\u00a0work on Thursday to help contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Mexico\u2019s Deputy Health Minister, Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell Ram\u00edrez. \"The entire federal government suspends work and each head of the dependencies will determine who is essential to avoid jeopardizing the operation of the institutions,\" L\u00f3pez-Gatell wrote on his Twitter page\u00a0Wednesday evening. In a second tweet, L\u00f3pez-Gatell asked the private sector to work on strategies that would maximize the number of employees who can work from home.\u00a0 Mexico's death toll from the novel coronavirus sits at six with 475 confirmed cases, according to the government. ##Health## Spanish football giants Real Madrid announced on Thursday, that in collaboration with the National Sports Council, they are launching an initiative to temporarily use the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid as a warehouse to store and distribute medical supplies aimed at fighting Covid-19.\u00a0 The medical supplies, with the authority of the state government, will be delivered to the Spanish health authorities to develop the most optimal and efficient use of the supplies. The Spanish club, in addition to making its home stadium available, will also be accepting donations that could be used by the health department. The distribution of these materials will be handled by the Ministry of Health to ensure that they are given to the hospitals that are most in need.\u00a0 The hope is that holding all of the materials in one place can facilitate the distribution process.\u00a0\u00a0 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said today that the US has \u201cnow brought over 10,000 Americans back home from places where they were stranded through no fault of their own.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to do. We\u2019ve got a lot of people who are trying to get back this way, and with travel shut down in many of these countries without any notice or little notice, there\u2019s still a major undertaking. But the team has martialed the resources. It\u2019s an airlift back home like we\u2019ve not seen in an awfully long time, and I\u2019m really proud of the way our team has responded,\u201d Pompeo told Hugh Hewitt on his radio show. On Wednesday, the head of the repatriation task force at the State Department said they were tracking 50,000 Americans who may seek help in returning to the US. ##Travel## A record number of Americans filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week, as businesses shut down to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 Initial jobless claims soared to a seasonally adjusted 3.28 million in the week ended March 21, according to the Department of Labor.\u00a0That is the highest number of initial jobless claims in history, since the Department of Labor started tracking the data in 1967.  Before coronavirus fears began affecting the US economy, it was powering ahead at historic rates. The bottom line: This crisis has swept away the complacency of a decade of economic expansion and perpetually rising stock markets. We see the daily counts of coronavirus cases and deaths, the long lines for tests, and the White House briefings where the President pretends the situation is not dire. But we're not able to see inside the emergency rooms and intensive care units where this invisible demon is being fought. We're not able to see the front lines. Or the full extent of the human suffering.\u00a0We only hear about the battle through the testimonies of doctors and nurses; though the pleas of governors and mayors; and through interviews with patients who are well enough to call in via Skype. Does this distort the public's understanding of the virus? Does the lack of visibility make it hard for some folks to process how serious this pandemic is?\u00a0 CNN asked\u00a0Esther Choo, emergency physician and health care advocate who started the #GetMePPE hashtag last week. Here's what she said via text:  \"This whole thing has been hampered by its abstractness. I mean, half the interviews on TV that I've seen are totally well people pissed they didn't get tested.\"\u00a0But they're not the real faces of this pandemic -- the hospitalized patients are.\u00a0\"The truth is, the sickest patients are terrifying,\" Choo said.\u00a0\"They are air hungry, dropping their oxygen, confused, distressed. We can never show that. But it is terrifying.\" Choo put it this way:  \"What\u00a0would the zombie apocalypse be like if we only had verbal descriptions of zombies, but could never show them?\" HIPAA restrictions and media ethics issues both stand in the way of having cameras in hospital corridors. So this crisis challenges reporters to get creative. ##Health## The Miami City passed a curfew during a virtual commission meeting.

On\u00a0at least four trekking routes, there are a total of around 500 foreign trekkers unable to return due to the lockdown, Shradha Shrestha, a spokeswoman for the Nepal Tourism Board told CNN. We are working with multiple government agencies to rescue the trekkers and bring them to Kathmandu, so that we can coordinate with the embassies to fly them back home, Shrestha said, adding the board has launched a website to make it easier for the stranded trekkers to reach out to authorities. \u201cSeveral embassies such as the German and French are already planning to send chartered flights to some of these areas to rescue the trekkers,\u201d Shrestha said. In a Twitter post, the British embassy in Kathmandu asked UK citizens in Nepal who are looking to return home to send it their details. \u201cWe're working closely with carriers and authorities to try to find a solution, and will contact you ASAP,\u201d the embassy said.

The House of Representatives is expected to take up the measure on Friday. Markets in Asia Pacific struggled for direction, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was the only major benchmark in the region to trade firmly in the green.  Deadliest day in the US:\u00a0Wednesday was the deadliest day the US has seen during the pandemic with 233 fatalities reported, taking the US to 65,273\u00a0cases and 938 deaths. California's cases are doubling every few days, while officials have warned that San Francisco could reach New York levels.

Watch: ##Daily Life## Prince Charles did not \u201cjump the queue\u201d for a coronavirus test, one of the UK\u2019s junior health ministers has said after it emerged that the royal had tested positive for the virus. Edward Argar was asked on Sky News why the Prince of Wales was able to get the test while some frontline medical workers with symptoms have not been tested. \u201cThe Prince of Wales\u00a0didn\u2019t jump the queue,\u201d Argar said. \u201cHis symptoms, his condition, met that criteria.\" Prince Charles, who is 71 years old and the heir to the British throne, is self-quarantining in Scotland with mild symptoms, Clarence House announced Wednesday. His wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, has also been tested and does not have the virus. Scotland\u2019s NHS website advises: \u201cGenerally, you'll only be tested for COVID-19 if you have a serious illness that requires admission to hospital.\" Scotland\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Catherine Calderwood told BBC Scotland on Thursday that she has spoken to the team looking after Prince Charles. \u201cMy understanding is there are very good clinical reasons for that person and his wife to be tested and I wouldn't be able to disclose anything else that I know because of patient confidentiality,\u201d she said. ##Health## The Indian government has announced a relief package worth $22.6 billion to assist those most affected by the coronavirus pandemic and the nationwide lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s only been 36 hours since the lockdown was imposed,\u201d the country\u2019s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a news conference on Thursday. \"Now we have come up with a package which will immediately take care of the welfare concerns of the poor and suffering workers and those who need immediate help.\" The relief package includes medical insurance cover of $66,400 per person to those working on the frontlines, such as medical workers, sanitation workers and community health workers. This measure will cover around 2 million people. The government will provide 800 million people -- nearly two-thirds of the country\u2019s population --\u00a0with 5 kilograms of rice or wheat each month for the next three months for free. \u201cWe do not want anyone to go hungry,\u201d Sitharaman said. Other measures announced include fast-tracking subsidies and benefits for farmers, construction workers, widows and the disabled as well as increasing the minimum wage. The 87 million farmers who currently receive $80 a year will be given the first instalment for the next financial year immediately, in the first week of April.  Workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) -- which guarantees 100 days of unskilled manual work per year -- will have their wages increased by $26. Senior citizens, widows and the disabled will get a one-time $13 payment over the next three months in two instalments, benefiting 30 million people.\u00a0 The 200 million female Jan Dhan (government\u2019s direct benefits transfer scheme) account-holders will get a one-time amount of $6.60 each per month for the next three months.  Women on the Ujjwala (government gas subsidy scheme) will be given free cylinders for three months. This will benefit 83 million families living below the poverty line. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a 21-day nationwide lockdown starting at midnight Wednesday.

The government was hoping to get 250,000 people to sign up. Hancock tweeted on Thursday: \u201cFantastic that 560,000 people have now responded to our call to volunteer to support our NHS to defeat #Coronavirus.\" Volunteers will be asked to carry out various tasks, including collecting shopping, medicines or other essential supplies to deliver to people who are self-isolating. They might also be asked to provide transport for patients who are being discharged from hospital, transporting medical supplies, or chatting with people who are self-isolating and at risk of loneliness. ##Health## Jordan on Wednesday eased one of the world's strictest lockdowns over the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0after it prompted chaotic scenes in the country.\u00a0 Days after a total curfew went into effect, people clamored to receive bread distributions from government trucks, the emergency hotline went offline after it apparently became overloaded with phone calls, and some reported they had nothing at home to eat.\u00a0 But on Tuesday, the government backtracked, loosening restrictions on movement. After four days of total lockdown, people were allowed to leave their homes on foot for essential trips, such as purchasing food from small convenient stores and obtaining medicine. A curfew is still in place from 6 p.m. to 10 a.m. Read the full story here ##Daily Life## With the cascading glissandos of the harp and the rich sounds of the cello, classical music is known to relieve stress or even lull you to sleep. And amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic, when anxiety has reached an all-time high, a good night's sleep is much needed. The Arkansas Symphony Orchestra's \"Bedtime with Bach\" series can help with that. Every night at 9 p.m., members of the orchestra post videos of themselves performing on\u00a0Facebook, all from the comfort of their homes in Little Rock, Arkansas. Song choices range from\u00a0Domenico Scarlatti's \"Sonata in B minor K.27\u00a0(performed by ASO's principal harpist Alisa Coffey) to\u00a0Aretha Franklin's \"I Say a Little Prayer for You\"\u00a0(performed by ASO's conductor and violinist Geoffrey Robson). The short performances are a way for the orchestra members to stay connected with the community while their concerts are canceled, members said. \"Music is alive, but it becomes more alive when you've got the audience's energy coming back at you,\" said Drew Irvin, ASO's co-concertmaster, who came up with the idea. \"So for now, we're going to make that through Facebook.\" The orchestra's normal concerts usually draw in about 1,000 audience members, Irvin said. The \"Bedtime with Bach\" series is even more popular, garnering thousands of views. Principal cellist David Gerstein's performance of \"Romance\" alone racked up 10,000 views.

Stores are shut, streets quiet, restaurants closed, face masks ubiquitous, and supermarket aisles empty. Phrases like social distancing and self-isolation have made their way into the public consciousness. In some places, like Thailand's capital Bangkok, people diligently follow the rules of social distancing -- even sitting feet apart from each other in neat grids in mall food courts. In other places like Japan, where the popular cherry blossom season is underway, social distancing doesn't appear to have taken hold yet. There were similar scenes in the United States, where more than a dozen states have imposed stay-at-home orders. Last weekend, crowds gathered on beaches, hiking trails, and parks in California, in open defiance of the state-wide order to shelter in place and avoid close contact with others. Meanwhile, in places like mainland China, coronavirus case numbers continue to drop every day -- leading to a cautious easing of travel restrictions and strict lockdowns. Businesses in China are returning to work, and even tourist sites are reopening -- the Badaling section of the Great Wall is finally open again this week, after being closed for two months. See all the pictures here ##Daily Life## Thousands of people are practicing social distancing worldwide -- but that's not stopping neighbors from leaving messages of hope in the windows of their homes. It's unclear where or when the effort started, but photos of people putting rainbows, colorful heart cutouts, teddy bears and anything that resembles a sign of hope have been spreading all over social media. Some are participating because they want their neighbors who have been deemed \"essential workers\" to see some joy on their way out of their homes. Others say they decorated their windows so families taking walks and getting fresh air have a nice reminder that everyone is in this together. In Norfolk, Virginia, Kyle Siebels told CNN he found out about the effort through his neighborhood Facebook page. When the Siebels family went for a walk Tuesday, Kyle said he saw 30 houses participating. On Monday, Kyle's wife, Tory, cut out the hearts and went to town on their front door. \"Our neighbors have started putting colored hearts in their windows for neighborhood kids to find on their walks while everyone is staying home,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"We laced up our door so they wouldn't miss our circle. Pretty cool to see how many houses have participated. Nora (Kyle and Tory's daughter) definitely loves our walks.\" Read the full story here: ##Daily Life## Even\u00a0$2 trillion is not enough\u00a0to dispel fears stalking Washington that the\u00a0coronavirus crisis\u00a0could pull down the economic foundation on which American life depends. There are several daunting takeaways from the\u00a0bulging pandemic stimulus bill\u00a0-- expected to clear Congress soon after the\u00a0Senate passed it unanimously\u00a0late Wednesday night, notwithstanding some last-minute quibbles by rank and file members on both sides. All of them underscore the extreme and historic nature of the crisis that may have already wiped out millions of jobs at a swipe. The human tragedy of the pandemic is being played out in growing lists of lost family members and the courage of medical professionals saving lives behind closed hospital doors. But the rescue bill's staggering size is the most public expression of the historic scale of the coronavirus disaster and the fragility of the systems that sustain American life. After all, in a matter of days, an economy powering ahead at historic rates suddenly needed a bill to plug a hole equal to 10% of US gross domestic product after the crisis swept away the complacency of a decade of economic expansion and perpetually rising stock markets. The breakneck speed at which the bill came together in a capital fractured by vicious divides is an example of rare compromise in the bitter aftermath of impeachment. But it also reflects the motivating power inherent in the threat of economic implosion. Thirdly, and perhaps most concerning, are signs that the biggest economic rescue measure in history won't be nearly sufficient to nurse the economy through the dark months to come. Leaders on all sides are clear that the package is a stopgap to get through the next few months -- and will not revive the economy without another huge cash injection. Read more about the stimulus package here ##Business## Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, has accused China of engaging in \u201cblatant and dangerous propaganda\u201d about the coronavirus, saying the world might have been spared the full impact had Chinese officials not suppressed facts early on. In an opinion piece published in Britain\u2019s The Times newspaper, Johnson says China failed in its obligation to the international community to share information about the outbreak transparently. \u201cFirst (China) tried to suppress the news. Then, it worked to protect its own population while selectively sharing critical information, such as genetic sequence data, and continuing to stonewall international health authorities that were offering assistance, requesting access and seeking more information,\u201d Johnson wrote.\n\u201cHad China done the right things at the right time, more of its own population, and the rest of the world, might have been spared the most serious impact of this disease. He added that when the crisis abates, there will need to be an evaluation of the costs of the \u201cbreakdown in international collaboration\u201d and China\u2019s actions early on. Some context: China has faced criticism both internationally and domestically for its handling of the outbreak in the first few weeks, when local officials in Wuhan detained and targeted doctors who tried to speak out about the emergence of a new virus. One of those doctors, Li Wenliang, later died of the virus, sparking fury and calls for freedom of speech on Chinese social media. Earlier this month, the Chinese government included Li in a list of of 506 healthcare and response workers who acted as \"advanced individuals in the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in national health system.\"\u00a0 WHO response: The World Health Organization has acknowledged \u201cmistakes\u201d made by China, but its officials have largely been positive about how the country has responded to the crisis. ##Health## As the aviation industry continues to be slammed by the coronavirus pandemic, one budget carrier has gone for a very different and rather divisive approach. Vietnamese airline Vietjet has launched an insurance policy named \"SKY COVID CARE\" that allows passengers to claim up to 200 million Vietnamese dong ($8,550) if they are infected with the virus while traveling on one of its flights. The aim of the\u00a0policy, which is free of charge and covers all domestic flights between March 23 and June 30, is to help \"bring passengers assurance,\" according to the airline. In an official statement, Vietjet says it's prepared to pay out \"tens of billion dong\" to ensure that its customers feel at ease while traveling during the ongoing crisis. \"The health safety of passengers and cabin crews are protected at the highest level against all risks of disease,\" reads the\u00a0statement on Vietjet's\u00a0official website.\n\"With the insurance, passengers are eligible for insurance coverage and benefits from Vietjet within 30 days starting at 00:01 of the flight date, regardless of how passengers are infected with the disease.\" How the policy works: To make a claim, passengers must provide proof that they've tested positive for coronavirus (subject to a test approved by Vietnam's Ministry of Health) and evidence they were treated \"at a hospital or at authorized medical camps located in the territory of Vietnam.\" Anyone who has already tested positive, or who has violated government travel regulations or quarantines, will be ineligible. Those with \"epilepsy or mental illness\" are also ineligible, along with anyone who submits incorrect personal information.

Wynn, a service dog in training, is bringing joy and comfort to the medical staff on the front lines of the battle against the\u00a0coronovirus in Denver, Colorado. The one-year-old yellow Labrador serves up cuddles to health care workers who need a much needed mental break from the emergency room at Rose Medical Center. Wynn is no stranger to the medical staff, as she's being trained by Susan Ryan, an emergency physician at the hospital. Ryan shared an image of the two of them on Sunday. In it, the doctor is seen wearing a face shield and a mask while sitting on the floor of the hospital petting Wynn. \"I saw Wynn coming back in from being walked outside,\" Ryan told CNN. \"I just slumped down on the floor and said 'can I just have a minute with her?'\" Ryan said she had just finished with a patient and washed up before getting some quality time with Wynn. \"Seeing stuff and hearing stuff that you can't unsee has an impact on you,\" Ryan said. \"That's where the dogs come in. When you are in the presence of the dog and petting them you are taking a moment to ground yourself at that present time.\" Now, Wynn is set up in the social workers office and on-call for staffers who need some puppy love to relieve stress. In the room, lights are dimmed and meditation music plays to provide the best place for medical staff to take a little mental break before returning to their jobs.

China's\u00a0Shanghai Composite\u00a0(SHCOMP)\u00a0declined 0.2%. Hong Kong's\u00a0Hang Seng\u00a0(HSI)\u00a0was flat. South Korea's\u00a0Kospi\u00a0(KOSPI)\u00a0was up 1.1% during volatile trading in Seoul. Australia's S&P/ASX 200, meanwhile, was the only major benchmark in the region to trade firmly in the green, and was last up 2.6% heading into the close.

The woman had been diagnosed with the coronavirus on March 13, and received intensive treatment at the Pohang public clinic, east of Daegu.  She is now under self-quarantine in her home in Cheongdo, where she lives with her son. ##Daily Life## ##Health## United States: Wednesday was the deadliest day the United States has seen during the coronavirus pandemic, with 233 fatalities reported.  The US Senate passed a massive $2 trillion stimulus package to boost the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak. The House of Representatives is expected to take up the measure on Friday. President Trump has indicated he will sign the bill. Numbers in the US as of the end of the day Wednesday: 65,273\u00a0cases, 938 deaths.

As the coronavirus begins to strike in prisons and detention centers,\u00a0the UN is urging governments \u201cnot to forget those behind bars\u201d and protect the staff members working in those facilities.\u00a0 \u201cGovernments are facing huge demands on resources in this crisis and are having to take difficult decisions,\" said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet in a statement Wednesday.  \"But I urge them not to forget those behind bars, or those confined in places such as closed mental health facilities, nursing homes and orphanages, because the consequences of neglecting them are potentially catastrophic.\" She laid out measures that authorities could take: They could reduce the number of people in detention and\u00a0examine ways to release particularly vulnerable detainees, like those who are older or already sick. Authorities overseeing these facilities should continue providing for the specific health-care needs of women prisoners, including those who are pregnant, and those of inmates with disabilities and juvenile detainees, Bachelet added. If prisons restrict visits for inmates, they should set up alternative measures like video conferencing or increased phone calls with family members, she said. Prisoners' rights need to be protected, she emphasized. Anti-pandemic measures should not undermine the fundamental rights of detained people, including their rights to adequate food and water, and access to a lawyer and doctor. ##Health## Back in January, when the coronavirus outbreak was triggering massive lockdowns and dramatic emergency measures in China, artist Chen Xiaotao Momo drew a cartoon that quickly became popular on Chinese social media. In the sketch, a bowl of \"hot dry noodles\" -- signature dish of Wuhan, the city at ground zero of the pandemic -- sits in a hospital bed with a face mask and teary eyes. At the window, regional cuisines representing different parts of China hold signs expressing encouragement and support. Wuhan was the first Chinese city to go under lockdown. Two months later, the worst of the pandemic appears to have passed in mainland China. Lockdowns and restrictions are slowly lifting, and provincial alert levels are being cautiously lowered. In a new cartoon, published by Chen yesterday, the bowl of noodles is no longer in bed. Instead the Wuhan dish waves happily to the crowd of food friends outside the window, which appears to include Sichuan hot pot and southern Chinese dim sum, among others. They appear to be cheering, \"Hubei restart,\" referring to the hard-hit province of which Wuhan is the capital. The cartoon has circulated widely in the past day -- the hashtag #HotDryNoodlesHasWokenUp is trending on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, with more than 210 million views. ##Daily Life## Three cruise ships off the coast of Western Australia have been told that under no circumstances will they be allowed to dock. The Artania is carrying 800 passengers, mostly Germans, seven of whom have the coronavirus.  \u201cThe Artania cruise ship must continue on its journey to South Africa urgently. This ship needs to leave immediately,\u201d Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan told reporters Thursday. He said if the seven passengers needed urgent medical assistance they should be sent to an Australian Defence Force base, then flown home to Germany. \u201cWe are working with the Australian government to do this immediately,\u201d he said. The MSC Magnifica has refueled in Fremantle and remains in waters off the coast of Western Australia. It had been planning to end its voyage in Dubai, and was at sea when its operator, MSC Cruises, temporarily halted its fleet.  MSC Cruises told CNN on March 23 that no passengers were ill. \u201cNobody on board -- passengers or crew -- has fever, signs of respiratory insufficiency or gastroenteric diseases,\u201d it said in a statement. The Vasco da Gama is carrying around 800 Australians, including 200 Western Australians, 109 New Zealanders, and 33 UK citizens and other foreigners, according to the WA government. It had been due to dock in Fremantle on Friday but has been requested to postpone its arrival until Monday to allow for the preparation of temporary accommodation on Rottnest Island.  The island, a protected nature reserve, will be used to house Western Australians onboard the ship for their 14-day quarantine period. Others onboard must remain on the ship until provisions are made to send them straight home.  No repeat: The Western Australian government is trying to avoid the scenario that played out in Sydney on March 19, when more than 2,600 passengers were allowed to leave the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Since then, 121 passengers have been confirmed to have Covid-19, according to the New South Wales Health Department. \u201cWe are not going to have a Sydney Harbor fiasco on our watch,\u201d McGowan said. ##Travel## President Donald Trump claimed\u00a0today the US had done more coronavirus testing than any other nation, after receiving domestic criticism over the rate of testing. \"In fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span,\" Trump\u00a0tweeted. Fact check:\u00a0While the US has overtaken South Korea in total numbers of coronavirus tests administered, it has conducted far fewer tests per capita, given the US population is more than six times larger than South Korea's. \"Yes, it is true that South Korea has run less tests as an absolute number. However, it is important to point out the huge difference in the population sizes,\" Aubree Gordon, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, told CNN. South Korea has a population of 51 million, and has conducted 357,896 tests so far, according to government figures. That means one in every 142 South Koreans have been tested. The US has a population of 329 million and has conducted 418,810 tests so far, according to the\u00a0Covid Tracking Project. That means one in every 785 Americans have been tested. The Russian government has ordered a ban on all regular and charter international flights starting tomorrow, Russian state media reported Thursday. An exception will be made only for flights used for repatriation of Russian citizens from abroad. ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Travel## A senior British diplomat stationed in Hungary has died after contracting\u00a0coronavirus, the UK's Foreign Office said on Wednesday. Steven Dick, aged 37, was the Deputy Head of Mission for the British embassy in Budapest. He died on Tuesday after contracting Covid-19, the Foreign Office said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"I am desperately saddened by the news of Steven's death and my heart goes out to his parents Steven and Carol.\" \"Steven was a dedicated diplomat and represented his country with great skill and passion.

Today, it appears residents are ignoring the warnings. Streets around the Meguro River are packed with people gathering to view the blooming cherry blossoms. Some are wearing masks, but just as many people aren't.  It's cherry blossom season -- meaning all week, people have been going to parks and public areas, picnicking outdoors, and gathering in large numbers. Authorities are urging citizens not to take the pandemic lightly -- Japan reported its largest single-day jump in cases yesterday --  but their pleas for social distancing appear to have had little effect. ##Daily Life## Travelers from the US and Europe entering South Korea will now be required to download a government self-quarantine smartphone app, according to the country\u2019s Central Disaster Relief Headquarters. The app will remind users to check their symptoms every day, and will monitor their location to confirm they are following the quarantine order. Those violating quarantine without a proper reason will be immediately reported to the authorities, and deported if they are foreign citizens. Police will immediately respond to the site when a person leaves their quarantine without authorization.\u00a0 Violating quarantine is punishable by up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 10 million won ($8,150). ##Travel## ##Daily Life## Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has ordered a government task force be set up in response to the coronavirus pandemic, as the number of cases in the country spiked today.\u00a0 The establishment of a task force is a requirement to declaring a state of emergency -- though Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today that the country was not yet at the point of declaring one.\u00a0 Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told media after the meeting that the government feared the number of new coronavirus cases was on the rise, with spikes in cases in big cities and from inbound travelers. Wednesday saw the highest single-day jump in cases so far, with 98 new cases. ##Health## A total of 77 people aboard Holland America's cruise ship \"Zaandam\" are reporting flu-like symptoms, according to a news release on the cruise line\u2019s website.\u00a0 The 77 people consist of 30 passengers and 47 crew members. \u201cSince it is flu season, and Covid-19 testing is not available on board, it is difficult to determine the cause of these elevated cases at this time,\u201d the release said. The Zaandam left Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7, before the cruise operator announced it would be suspending global cruise operations for a month. The voyage was scheduled to end in San Antonio, Chile, last Saturday.\u00a0According to the release, no one has been off the ship since March 14 in Puenta Arena, Chile, where guests were initially told they could disembark for flights but were not permitted to.\u00a0\u00a0 All ports along the\u00a0Zaandam\u2019s route are now closed to cruise ships.\u00a0 A second ship is bringing help: Holland America has deployed a second ship to bring extra supplies, staff, coronavirus test kits and other support to the Zandaam. The support ship left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on Sunday and will meet with the Zandaam on Thursday night. \u00a0 Passengers isolated on board: Passenger Maureen Foran, 75, says she has had no face-to-face contact with anyone, family or crew, since the ship imposed a quarantine onboard.\u00a0 \u201cWe are forbidden to leave our rooms,\u201d Foran told CNN. \u201cI am thankful for a window but I am getting claustrophobic.\u201d ##Travel## The number of coronavirus cases in California is doubling every three to four days, the state's top health official said.  \u201cWe originally thought that it would be doubling every six to seven days and we see cases doubling every three to four days,\u201d Dr. Mark Ghaly, the secretary of California's Health and Human Services Agency, said at a news conference Wednesday. \"We\u2019re watching that trend very, very closely.\u201d\u00a0 Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered most of the state's nearly 40 million residents to stay at home to stop the virus from spreading further. However, public health experts say that it may take up to two weeks to see the results of such travel restrictions, as the virus' incubation period ranges from one to 14 days.  Ghaly said authorities in California are anticipating a surge of cases and patients in a week or two.\u00a0 A stark warning for San Francisco: Meanwhile, San Francisco Mayor London Breed warned Wednesday that if residents don't heed orders to stay at home, the California city could see a surge in coronavirus cases. \u201cIf people who are out on the streets continue to congregate with one another, continue to interact with one another, which increases the spread of this virus, we will not have enough beds, enough ICU units, enough ventilators to support the people that we know are going to need them,\u201d Breed said. The mayor estimated San Francisco would need at least 1,500 more ventilators and 5,000 extra hospital beds to meet a larger surge of patients. \"It is plausible that despite all these efforts we could have a scenario similar to the one that is playing out in New York this very day,\" said San Francisco Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax. \"If that happens our capacity, our surge capacity will be far exceeded.\"\u00a0 ##Health## ##Daily Life## Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike urged residents in the city to avoid making \"non-essential outings\" this weekend as the city reported an increase in its number of novel coronavirus cases. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Koike said Tokyo is now at a \"critical moment\" to stop the infection rate from spiking. She asked event organizers to refrain from holding large gatherings and urged Tokyo residents to work from home as much as possible and avoid social meetings and crowded places until April 12. Koike\u2019s latest remarks will be a test for the city of over 9 million people, which has been reluctant to impose a lockdown on its residents. While other countries have been quick to enforce restrictions on their citizens to contain the spread of the coronavirus, in Japan it\u2019s largely been business as usual.\u00a0 Remote working kicks in: Some Japanese companies have adopted the practice of encouraging their employees to work from home to prevent exposing them to the virus on congested public transport and offices, but many still commute to work.\u00a0 Precautions urged: On March 19, a central government expert panel called on organizers of large-scale events to exercise caution, including canceling plans, to prevent the spread of the virus. But despite such warnings, over the weekend, many still ventured out to view the cherry blossoms in Tokyo\u2019s parks and public areas.\u00a0 Biggest single-day jump: As of Wednesday evening local time, Tokyo reported 41 new cases of novel coronavirus, according to Koike. Japan reported 98 new cases and two more deaths on Wednesday, marking the country's largest single-day jump in new infections since the outbreak began. ##Daily Life## ##Health## China\u2019s National Health Commission reported 67 new imported cases of the novel coronavirus yesterday. That brings the total number of imported cases to 541 in mainland China.  China appears to have passed the worst of the pandemic. Nearly all new cases inside the country have been imported in recent days -- no new locally transmitted cases were reported yesterday -- and hard-hit Hubei province has begun lifting some of the stringent measures put in place to stop the virus from spreading.  Total numbers: By the end of Wednesday in mainland China, the country had confirmed 81,285 coronavirus cases and 3,287 deaths. More than 74,000 have recovered and been discharged from hospital. ##Health## The United States has now reported at least 65,273\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus and 938 deaths, according to CNN's tally.  The national total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases from overseas. Today was the deadliest day of the pandemic in the US so far -- there were at least 233 new deaths reported Wednesday nationwide. \u00a0##Health## Stimulus bill passes Senate: The United States Senate voted 96 to 0 to pass a $2 trillion economic relief package meant to kick-start a moribund economy that's been dragged down by the novel coronavirus pandemic and the stringent measures put in place to stop the virus' spread. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives, which plans to vote on it on Friday, leaders in that chamber said. If approved, the stimulus would be one of the most expensive pieces of legislation ever enacted by the US government. The Senate shot down an amendment from Republican Sen. Ben Sasse that would have capped unemployment benefits at 100% of the wages workers received while employed. It was expected to fail. Proponents said the bill in its current form incentivized people not to work, while opponents of the amendment like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said it was wrong to fixate on minor perks for working-class Americans while providing millions of dollars worth of bailouts to big corporations. Deadliest day in US: While senators worked to get the stimulus past a major hurdle, medical workers faced one of the toughest days we've seen during the pandemic. More than 230 people in the US died of coronavirus on Wednesday, according to CNN's tally, the most fatalities the country has seen in a single day so far during the pandemic.  To date, at least 65,273 coronavirus patients have been identified in the US. At least 938 have died. Spain's death toll passes China's: The situation in Spain is even more grave -- the total number of infections there is inching closer to 50,000, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. At over 3,600 fatalities, the number of coronavirus-related deaths reported in the country has surpassed those in China. Only Italy has reported more deaths. The Spanish government has voted to extend the country's state of emergency in order to slow the pandemic within its borders. Spikes in Japan and New Zealand: Authorities in both countries saw their highest daily jumps in cases Wednesday, with Japan identifying 98 patients and New Zealand 73.  New Zealand's alert level has been raised to Level 4 -- its highest -- which significantly restricts residents' movement. Tokyo faces a major test this weekend, as its governor has asked people in the megalopolis to stay home to avoid contracting or spreading the virus.    ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Business## ##Travel## Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan has consistently rejected calls for a nationwide lockdown, claiming that an all-out closure of businesses would affect the\u00a0\u201c25% of the population that lives below the poverty line,\u201d the country's daily wage earners who Khan said would lose their incomes in a heartbeat.\u00a0 But for all intents and purposes, a lockdown is what seems to be in place in Pakistan: All international and domestic flights have been suspended\nTrains are not running\nHighway journeys between provinces are banned Military steps in: While Khan\u2019s government deals with growing criticism for not shutting down the country soon enough, the hugely popular military has been lauded for stepping in and announcing measures including the suspension of public transport and timed closure of gas stations. Troops have been deployed in all major cities to enforce these measures.\u00a0 Rising caseload: According to figures released by the country's Ministry of Health, the number of patients diagnosed with coronavirus in Pakistan crossed 1,000 yesterday. Ten days ago that number was at 53. At least seven people are also confirmed dead.\u00a0All major phone networks have changed their call tunes to messages asking people to wash their hands and state TV has messages in\u00a0regional languages explaining the importance of social distancing. Mosques stay open: One of the largest clusters of the virus sprung up in the outskirts of the capital Islamabad, where a large congregation of preachers met, disregarding the government\u2019s requests for three or more people not to gather in a public space.\u00a0 Medical equipment lacking: Public health specialist Dr. Arshad Altaf told CNN that there are roughly fewer than 3,000 ventilators available in the country, and while China has provided aid worth $4 million to Pakistan, alongside medical face masks and ventilators, this is still not enough to deal with the exponential growth of the virus. Pakistan\u2019s National Disaster Management Authority, which is connected to the military, has taken over the reins in dealing with the crisis and Altaf welcomed the move. \u201cThere has to be a multi-pronged effort, the government cannot deal with this alone,\u201d he said.\u00a0 ##Business## ##Daily Life## ##Health## The Senate has just approved a historic, $2 trillion stimulus package in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with a final vote of 96 to zero in favor of the bill.\u00a0 Why this matters: The legislation represents the largest emergency aid package in US history and the most significant legislative action taken to address the rapidly intensifying coronavirus crisis, which is overwhelming hospitals and grinding much of the economy to a halt. What comes next: The package will next go to the House for a vote. The House will convene Friday morning to consider the bill, and the plan is to pass the bill by voice vote. President Donald\u00a0Trump has indicated he will sign the measure.\u00a0 What's in the bill: Key elements of the proposal are $250 billion set aside for direct payments to individuals and families, $350 billion in small business loans, $250 billion in unemployment insurance benefits and $500 billion in loans for distressed companies. The bill would also provide a major amount of funding for hard-hit hospitals -- $130 billion -- and $150 billion for state and local governments that are cash-strapped due to their response to coronavirus. It also has a provision that would block Trump and his family, as well as other top government officials and members of Congress, from getting loans or investments from Treasury programs in the stimulus, according to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office. ##Business## The US House of Representatives will consider the $2 trillion economic relief package on Friday morning, announced Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. The bill is currently being voted on by the Senate. When it goes to the House, the plan is to pass the bill by voice vote, said Hoyer in a notice to House members. What's the bill about? The bill will respond to the coronavirus pandemic, offering cash and assistance for regular Americans, Main Street businesses and hard-hit airlines and manufacturers, among others. ##Business## The Spanish government voted to extend the current state of emergency until April 12 as the country continues to grapple with one of the world's most severe novel coronavirus outbreaks.  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the decision was \"a new sacrifice for all,\" but essential to \"gain time\" to allow hospitals to take care of patients and investigators to develop a vaccine. \"Social isolation is the only way to stop this virus,\" he said. S\u00e1nchez said stricter measures regarding freedom of movement would be put in place, but people would still be allowed to go out and buy groceries and medicine. He said all essential industries would continue to work.\u00a0 As of 10:30 p.m. ET, Spain had identified more than 49,500 coronavirus patients, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The country's death toll surpassed that of mainland China on Wednesday, trailing only Italy. At least 3,647 have died. ##Health## ##Daily Life## The US Senate is now voting on the massive $2 trillion stimulus package to deliver relief to an economy hard hit by coronavirus.  It needs to clear a 60-vote threshold to pass and will next head to the House.\u00a0 Amendment fails: Right before this vote, the Senate had voted down an amendment from Republican Senator Ben Sasse that would have capped unemployment benefits at 100% of the wages workers received while employed.  Sanders rips into GOP senators: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lambasted Republican senators who had supported Sasse's amendment over concerns that the bill's provisions would\u00a0incentivize unemployment. \"What happened is Sen. (Lindsey) Graham and some other Republicans, they are just terribly upset that low-income workers might receive a bit more money than they otherwise would have earned,\" Sanders told CNN, before the chamber voted on the bill. \"Here we are in the midst of the worst economic downturn perhaps since the Great Depression, tens of millions of people are worried to death about how they're going to feed their families, pay their rent, prevent a foreclosure,\" Sanders added. \"And these guys are just staying up nights worrying about low-income workers getting a few bucks more.\" ##Business## \"We ended up getting our first positive patients -- and that's when all hell broke loose,\" said one New York City doctor. The doctor, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity out of concern for his job, described a hospital that was woefully unprepared for an influx of Covid-19 patients that started roughly two weeks ago -- which has already stretched the hospital's resources thin and led to severely ill patients outnumbering ventilators. \"We don't have the machines, we don't have the beds,\" the doctor said. \"To think that we're in New York City and this is happening,\" he added. \"It's like a third-world country type of scenario. It's mind-blowing.\" At first, patients skewed toward the 70-plus age group, but in the past week or so there have been a number of patients younger than 50. \"I don't think they understand the severity of this disease,\" the doctor said of the younger patients. \"Two weeks ago, life was completely different.\" Read more about the influx of patients here ##Health## New Zealand confirmed 73 new coronavirus patients and identified five more probable cases from 9:30 a.m. local time yesterday until the same time today, the country's Ministry of Health said in a statement.  That's the biggest single-day jump in cases in the country since the pandemic began.  \"Of our new cases today, the majority still have a link to overseas travel, including being in the same household as someone who has returned from overseas, have attended a known event or linked to a cluster of other cases or are close contacts of a confirmed case,\" the ministry said.  As of this morning in New Zealand, the country has confirmed a total of 262 coronavirus cases and identified 21 probable patients. Twenty-seven have recovered. \"These are unprecedented times for New Zealand and other countries around the globe.\u00a0We are all in this together.\u00a0We will expect the number of cases to increase for at least the next ten days.\u00a0If we all do our bit, and we break the chain of transmission, slow the spread of COVID-19 and we will be able to get on top of this,\" the ministry said. Authorities said they have identified several possible outbreak clusters: Marist College in Auckland\u00a0\nThe World Hereford cattle conference in Queenstown\nA wedding in Wellington\nA trip by a Wellington group of friends to the US\nA contact with the Ruby Princess in Hawkes Bay\u00a0\nA rest home in Hamilton.\u00a0 Strict measures in force: The rise in new cases comes a day after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern decided to raise New Zealand's alert to the highest Level 4, placing \"the most significant\" restrictions on its people \"in our modern history,\" she said.   In her\u00a0statement announcing\u00a0the measures, which went into effect just before midnight, Arden acknowledged no other country has moved as fast to restrict daily life, but the trigger was early evidence of community transmission in New Zealand. \"Unlike so many other gravely inundated countries, we have a window of opportunity to stay home, break the chain of transmission, and save lives. It\u2019s that simple,\" she said. ##Health## More than 200 deaths from Covid-19 were reported Wednesday in the United States -- a new high for fatalities recorded in a single day. The dramatic spike brought the number of\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0deaths since the outbreak reached the United States in late January to at least 928. Sunday morning -- less than four days ago -- the nationwide total was 326 deaths, according to CNN data derived from state reports. Officials reported 223 deaths Wednesday, an increase higher than any other day. Tuesday saw 164 reports. Experts have said numbers will rise dramatically as more tests are administered and analyzed. At the White House coronavirus task force news conference, President Donald Trump said: \"The more aggressively we commit to social distancing ... the more lives we can save.\" More than 65,000 people in the United States have now had a positive test for the novel coronavirus.

On Tuesday, McDonald's Hong Kong announced it would be closing its 235 branches in the city -- usually open 24 hours -- from 6 p.m. every day. That's devastating news for the hundreds of people experiencing homelessness who regularly spend their nights in the restaurants.  A study in 2018 found there had been a five-fold increase in the number of people sleeping in McDonald's outlets, a number that has likely gone up as the city has felt the pinch from the coronavirus slowdown. Homeless charities had already reported record numbers of people seeking relief in recent weeks.  \"Hundreds of homeless individuals rely on this fast food restaurant for a safe shelter each and every night in Hong Kong,\" said Jeff Rotmeyer, founder of ImpactHK, a local charity.  Government homeless shelters are only opened during extreme weather, and do not provide a long-term solution for many people sleeping rough.  Help on the horizon: A fundraising push by ImpactHK to raise money to house \"McRefugees\" has already passed its 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,900) goal.  \"Wow you guys came through on this crowdfunding campaign,\" Rotmeyer said Wednesday in a Facebook video. \"We're looking at possibly housing 50 individuals in a single week.\" \nThose receiving support from the charity will be put up in a hotel or other accommodation for at minimum two weeks. \"During that time they can get a good night's sleep, they can have a shower, they'll have a bathroom, they don't have to worry about shelter, or about food, because we have breakfast, lunch and dinner every day,\" Rotmeyer said. \n\"During those two weeks we hope to have great conversations with these individuals and really see how as friends we can further our support to power them up,\" he added. Crowdfunding continues: Rotmeyer said 100% of funds would be used to support the homeless and would go to small hotels suffering from the economic slowdown.  ##Business## ##Daily Life## Bolivia's interim president declared a state of emergency and nationwide lockdown on Wednesday, to go into effect on Thursday at midnight. It will last through April 15, said interim president Jeanine Anez. In an address to the nation late Wednesday, Anez said Bolivians hadn't followed the government-ordered mandatory quarantine measures -- so the risk of infection is now higher, and needs more stringent containment measures. All borders will be closed, and no public or private vehicles will be allowed to travel except for certain essential reasons. \"No one leaves, nor does anyone enter the country, except for security and health reasons,\" said Anez. Nobody is allowed to leave their homes at all on weekends, when \"all outings are prohibited\" except for medical or security emergencies, she said. During the week, one person per household between the ages of 18-65 are allowed to go outside to buy groceries. This designated shopper will be assigned a weekday, and can only go outside on that day, according to a communique from the Bolivian state-news agency ABI, citing Anez. Bolivia now has 39 cases of the coronavirus and no deaths, according to the health authorities. ##Health## ##Daily Life## The US Congress is expected to vote tonight on a\u00a0$2 trillion stimulus bill\u00a0to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.

The latest move is aimed at preventing the spread of the virus, as Japan has seen a rise in people testing positive after returning from overseas trips.  Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi also warned that people traveling abroad may find their mobility restricted or be unable to find flights home if the\u00a0country they visit issues a lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Earlier this week, the foreign ministry also requested that those returning to Japan from the United States self-quarantine for two weeks.  ##Travel## Japan reported 98 new cases of the coronavirus and two more deaths on Wednesday, marking the country's largest single-day jump in new infections since the outbreak began.

A similar plan was utilized after September 11 attacks.\u00a0 The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has a request from New York and other states for assistance in mortuary operations.\u00a0 \u201cFEMA\u2019s National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) has received requests for HHS Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT) from the States of Hawaii, New York, and North Carolina. These requests are currently in the review and approval process,\u201d a FEMA spokesperson told CNN.\u00a0 New York City has longstanding contracts with companies to also provide refrigerated trucks to store bodies, but that plan has not been put in to effect just yet.\u00a0If and when it is, those trucks would likely be stationed at various locations including makeshift hospitals such as the Javits Center. ##Health## Two different Boston hospitals tell CNN that they now each have more than 40 employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital has 45 employees that have tested positive, Brigham Health Media Relations Associate Serena Bronda told CNN. \u201cEmployees who have tested positive are not working until after they have been cleared by Occupational Health Services,\u201d Bronda said. Massachusetts General Hospital has 41 employees who have tested positive, but most are believed to have contracted the virus somewhere other than the hospital, said Senior Public Affairs Officer Terri Ogan. \u201cBased on hospital data, our broad implementation of CDC-guided infection control procedures throughout the hospital, and the extent of community spread now ongoing in Massachusetts,\u00a0it\u2019s believed that the vast majority of these individuals did not contract the virus at work,\u201d Ogan said in an email. ##Health## New data shows nearly 70% of the hotel rooms in the United States were vacant last week, according to data and analytics group STR.\u00a0 That national occupancy rate is a 56% decline from the same week last year.\u00a0The\u00a0average occupied room cost is about $93, also down from last year.\u00a0 The San Francisco area and New York recorded the worst declines, with less than 17% of hotel rooms in both cities occupied, according to STR.\u00a0That represents an 80% decrease from this time last year. Many hotels across the country have closed entirely.\u00a0One example, The Boston Harbor Hotel, a luxury property in downtown Boston, closed last Saturday, according to its website, and hopes to reopen May 18. ##Business## ##Daily Life## Boeing, which recently asked\u00a0lawmakers for a massive financial aid package\u00a0to prop up its industry, could qualify for a special $17 billion slice of the proposed $2 trillion stimulus package. It's not clear, however, whether the company would actually take the funds. The aerospace giant is among the companies that would qualify for the government-backed loans reserved \"for businesses critical to maintaining national security,\" and the only one that has made it clear that it needs the assistance. The company is intricately linked to both the US government and the nation's economy. It is the country's largest exporter, is a major government contractor, and consistently ranks among the top 10 companies lobbying federal officials, with millions spent annually. The company has also come under scrutiny from lawmakers and the Federal Aviation Administration after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people and internal documents showed the company mocked and belittled its regulators.\u00a0 Some context:\u00a0Boeing said last week that \"a minimum of $60 billion\" in public and private loans is necessary \"to manage the pressure on the aviation sector and the economy as a whole.\" It said it would share \"much of any liquidity support to Boeing\" with its vast network of suppliers. ##Business## The Pentagon confirmed Wednesday that a Marine who works inside the building has tested positive for Covid-19. A defense official said the last time the Marine, an officer, was in the Pentagon was March 13. He began self-isolation on March 15. He works in the plans, policy and operations office of Marine Corps headquarters. This is the first military personnel based at the Pentagon to test positive. \u201cA marine stationed at the Pentagon tested positive for Covid-19 on March 24. Per U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines, the Marine is in isolation at his home and will undergo further assessment by health professionals,\" the Marines said in a statement. \"The Marine followed official guidance by isolating himself when his spouse began to show symptoms.\u00a0Once he became ill, he contacted his assigned medical facility. His workspace has been cleaned by a Pentagon response team and a thorough contact investigation is underway to mitigate risk and preserve the health of our Marines, civilians, and families.\u201d Separately, a staff member who works in the Pentagon\u2019s National Military Command Center is awaiting test results, a second defense official confirmed. It's not immediately clear when the person was last in the command center and what part of that complex they work in.\u00a0 Defense One was first to report both cases. ##Health##"], "Language": false}
