He added that his commission would be \u201csolutions-oriented\u201d but would also aim to \u201ctell\u00a0the story of systematic, legal\u00a0discrimination, injustice and\u00a0cruelty for over 400 years.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo followed up, \u201cIf the commission suggested\u00a0direct cash payments to the\u00a0descendants of slaves, do you\u00a0support the recommendation of\u00a0the commission?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Steyer said.  \u201cIf we want to figure out how to\u00a0repair the wrong together, we\u00a0have to go back and tell the\u00a0story of what's happened so that\u00a0we understand how we got here so\u00a0together we come up with the\u00a0right solution.\u201d Steyer has made courting black voters central to his presidential campaign, especially in South Carolina, the state where he is staking his campaign. See the moment: Tom Steyer said he supports 12-year term limits for members of Congress, and named three Republican senators as his argument for his proposal.\u00a0 \u201cIf we want real change, we\u00a0need new and different people in\u00a0charge.\u00a0We need it,\" Steyer said. \"And, you know, look, the\u00a0six-word argument for term\u00a0limits: Mitch McConnell, Lindsey\u00a0Graham, Ted Cruz.\u201d McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, is the Senate Majority Leader and was elected to the US Senate in 1984. Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1994, and later was elected to the Senate. Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, was elected to the Senate in 2012.\u00a0 Watch: Tom Steyer said he would mandate that Americans get vaccinated against the coronavirus if there was a vaccine developed and it was necessary to prevent the disease spreading in the US.  \u201cIf and when they were to develop\u00a0a vaccine, if you were president, would you mandate that Americans\u00a0take the vaccine?\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked Steyer.\u00a0 \u201cIf it were necessary to take\u00a0the vaccine to prevent the\u00a0spread of the coronavirus\u00a0through the United States, yes,\u00a0I would,\u201d the billionaire businessman responded.\u00a0 Steyer criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus and praised former President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the Ebola outbreak in 2014.\u00a0 \u201cWhat we're seeing is\u00a0that this is a pandemic that\u00a0hasn't been handled well,\u201d Steyer said .\u00a0 The death toll from the\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0has risen to 2,698 worldwide, with the vast majority of those in mainland China. The total number of\u00a0global cases\u00a0stands at over 80,000. World Health Organization officials say it's still too early to declare the novel coronavirus a pandemic -- but now is the time to prepare. See Steyer\u2019s response: Tom Steyer faced an unexpected challenge to his climate credentials on Monday night when an exasperated voter asked how the billionaire can really be \"pro-environment\" when his campaign is sending out so, so, so much mail. \"How do you justify this unnecessary overkill of mailings and printed material in a digital world that would certainly be much more environmentally friendly?\" asked Steven, who said he gets three to five mailers from Steyer every week. The businessman tried to cut the tension with a joke. \u201cI think we\u2019re also bombarding you with digital material,\" Steyer said, before turning serious. \u201cBut we have tried to use only recyclable materials.\u201d Steyer then turned to his own behavior, claiming that he is the only candidate not to travel on private planes and talking about a family ranch. \u201cMy wife and I raise cattle, chicken and pigs,\" he said. \"And we\u2019re trying to do it in a way to show that actually you can sequester carbon if you do regenerative agriculture.\u201d The upshot? That sequestration, Steyer said, more than cancels out his own overall carbon footprint. Watch: Tom Steyer said Monday that it was a \"mistake\" for his company to own stock in private prisons earlier in his career. The comment comes after former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Steyer\u2019s investment in private prisons. \u201cWe bought stock in a private\u00a0prison company 15 years ago.\u00a0I thought it was the right\u00a0thing,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cI decided it was the wrong thing\u00a0and 15 years ago I sold it for\u00a0moral reasons.\u201d He added: \u201cI came to the conclusion that\u00a0I've come to conclude now, this\u00a0isn't a place to make money.\u00a0But I didn't just make a mistake\u00a0and correct it.\u00a0I have worked to get rid of the\u00a0use of private prisons in my\u00a0home state, and we've\u00a0successfully done it so that\u00a0they're not used either for\u00a0incarceration or detention.\u201d Steyer has been making significant inroads in South Carolina, especially with black voters in the state. That rise could hurt Biden, who is betting his campaign on a first-place showing in South Carolina. Hear his answer: Tom Steyer said it is \u201cinappropriate\u201d for Bernie Sanders to praise former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro\u2019s regime for its literacy efforts. The businessman said he would never praise \u201cunelected leaders of countries who completely control without any form of democracy, justice or equality.\u201d\u00a0 Steyer\u2019s comments come as Sanders faces backlash for saying that Castro\u2019s regime had succeeded in some ways, and cited literacy as an example. The Vermont senator stood by those comments in a CNN town hall Monday night, saying that \u201cthe truth is the truth.\u201d\u00a0 But Steyer said of Castro, who died in 2016: \u201cHe's had the government own the economy and people are hungry and he's been a cruel controller of the country. I don't think it's appropriate to be giving him a lot of compliments.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe United States is supposed to be the value driven leader of the world. We stand for freedom. We stand for democracy and justice and equality. And I think when we go out to the world, we should be standing up for the things that we believe in. That's what the whole idea of the United States is,\u201d Steyer said.\u00a0 See the moment: Tom Steyer said the American people haven\u2019t spoken \u201cjust yet\u201d when asked how he would combat Bernie Sanders\u2019 momentum in the presidential race. CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo pointed out that Sanders won Nevada, New Hampshire and had a strong showing in Iowa, where results are still being examined and Pete Buttigieg holds a narrow lead over Sanders.\u00a0 \u201cYou are in a hole versus (Sanders) in\u00a0terms of how those results have\u00a0gone,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cDo you have a plan to change\u00a0your fate?\u201d The billionaire businessman responded, \u201cSo far, Bernie has 39 delegates\u00a0out of the 2,000 that he needs\u00a0to be the Democratic nominee.\u00a0So I would say the people of\u00a0America haven't spoken just\u00a0yet.\u201d Steyer said South Carolina is a diverse state with a high proportion of African Americans and Latinos, and reflects the Democratic Party and the United States.\u00a0 \u201cI don't think we should let the\u00a0three states that, together, add\u00a0up to about as much as South\u00a0Carolina, dictate what South\u00a0Carolina has to say.\" \u201cHow about let's let the people\u00a0of South Carolina have their say, and say what they care about and\u00a0stop declaring that this is over\u00a0and that the conversation is\u00a0over and we should just end it,\u201d Steyer said.\u00a0 \u201cThat is so early and premature, I can't believe it,\u201d he continued. Hear Steyer\u2019s response: Businessman Tom Steyer had barely said hello before he began taking his shot at the Democratic front-runner. \"I know there\u2019s been a lot of talk this week about Bernie Sanders,\" Steyer said. \"And I think we all owe Bernie Sanders a lot of thanks for bringing up real issues that are confronting America and Americans.\"  The crowd cheered. Then Steyer got to his criticism. \"But I want to say I disagree with his solutions in many instances. I don\u2019t think a government takeover of major parts of the American economy is a good idea,\" Steyer said. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for working people, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for families. I know that unchecked capitalism has failed.\" The answer, Steyer argued, was to \u201cbreak the corporate stranglehold\u201d on the government. Watch: Pete Buttigieg was asked to tell the town hall audience three things the American people don\u2019t already know about him.\u00a0 \u201cThat's a hard one, just because I\u00a0feel like when you run for\u00a0president, somebody once called\u00a0it an MRI of the soul. By the end of it, or frankly by the middle of it, you feel like people have gotten to know just about everything about you,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI\u2019ll mention one,\u201d Buttigieg continued.  \u201cPeople keep asking me why I'm\u00a0not more outwardly emotional, and\u00a0one of the things I think people\u00a0don't know about me is how\u00a0passionate I am.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I\u2019ve learned to deal with things in a way that tries to be as calm as possible, because I feel so passionate\u00a0about things I see going on\u00a0around the world and things I\u00a0see happening right around me,\u201d he continued.  The former mayor said the American people probably \u201cdon't know as much\u00a0about the things I'm bad at\u00a0because you don't advertise\u00a0those, although I think people are\u00a0beginning to learn I can't\u00a0dance.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI just can\u2019t,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cExactly. Somebody saw me doing the \u2014\u00a0I won\u2019t even do it, the raise the\u00a0roof thing,\u201d he joked, raising his hands above his head for a moment.\u00a0 He said his favorite food is beef jerky, and said he is \u201cpretty well-behaved\u201d when asked by CNN's Don Lemon if he eats in the middle of the night. Hear Buttigieg\u2019s answer: Pete Buttigieg turned a question about how he would handle the threat of the coronavirus into an attack on President Donald Trump\u2019s push for a wall on the US-Mexico border.\u00a0 \u201cWe have to meet 21st Century security threats with a forward looking policy. This President's idea of keeping us safe is a big wall. That's a 17th Century security solution,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor said his coronavirus response would focus on coordination across the federal government.\u00a0 Buttigieg also said it was crucial to \u201crestore the credibility of the United States in the rest of the world.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe virus does not care what country it is in, and in order to deal with an issue like that, you need international partnerships and global relationships of the very kind that this president is tearing to shreds on an almost daily basis,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Watch the moment: Businessman Tom Steyer has taken the stage. CNN's Chris Cuomo is moderating.  Pete Buttigieg recalled a campaign event in Colorado where a 9-year-old asked the former mayor for advice on how to be brave in telling other people that he is gay.\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re a 9-year-old asking that publicly\u00a0around thousands of people, you don't need any\u00a0lessons from me on bravery,\u201d Buttigieg said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd that\u2019s more or less what I told him,\u201d he continued. \u201cAlthough I gave him the best advice that I could for the future, which is mainly just to let him know that even if\u00a0it's not always easy, that I was going\u00a0to be rooting for him and other\u00a0people were, too.\u201d \u201cThere have been so many moments\u00a0like that.\u00a0Whether it's a young person who\u00a0is wondering where they fit, and this campaign sends a signal\u00a0to them that they belong,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cOr people I meet sometimes who\u00a0are my parents' age who come up\u00a0to me, sometimes with tears in\u00a0their eyes, to let me know they\u00a0never thought this day would\u00a0come, that this would even be possible,\u201d Buttigieg continued.  \u201cAnd that whole thing makes me\u00a0hopeful,\u201d he said. See Buttigieg's response: Pete Buttigieg said Monday that all non-profit institutions, including colleges and shelters, should lose their federal funding if they refuse to hire LGBTQ Americans. \u201cDo you\u00a0believe other religious and non-profit institutions like colleges and\u00a0homeless charities should lose\u00a0federal funding if they refuse\u00a0to hire or serve LGBTQ people,\u201d CNN\u2019s Don Lemon asked Buttigieg. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cif they are discriminating then they should not be doing it with federal dollars.\u201d The response came after Buttigieg was asked by a voter about how he would uphold the separation of church and state, particularly when it comes to federal funding. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. I believe that federal funding\u00a0should never be used to\u00a0discriminate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic principle. I feel this way as citizen and a\u00a0person of faith.\u201d He added: \u201cOf course it is so important to\u00a0the fabric of the country that\u00a0people of every religion and of no\u00a0religion can practice their faith to\u00a0the best of their conscience.\u00a0But like any other freedom, that freedom ends\u00a0where it you begin to invoke it\u00a0to harm other people.\u201d Watch the moment: Pete Buttigieg said he hasn\u2019t spoken with any Democratic presidential rivals about consolidating the field so that one moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders emerges.\u00a0 The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor said that \u201cof course I think it would be beneficial if everybody else were to drop out and support\u201d his campaign.\u00a0 He said he\u2019s demonstrated that he has support across the ideological spectrum, and noted his apparent win in Iowa, where he and Sanders are virtually tied in state delegate equivalents. Sanders then won the New Hampshire primary and the Nevada caucuses.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m the best alternative to Sen. Sanders because I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s beat him this year, anywhere,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Hear his response: After Sanders won the Democratic caucuses in Nevada last week, Buttigieg gave a speech warning against a \"rush\" to nominate the Vermont senator. He returned to that argument on Monday night -- this time in response to Sanders' refusal to back off his praise of Fidel Castro's early efforts to spread literacy in Cuba. \"As a Democrat, I don\u2019t want to be explaining why our nominee is encouraging people to look on the bright side of the Castro regime going into the election of our lives,\" Buttigieg said. Asked if he could appreciate the nuance of Sanders' remarks, which also included a criticism of the Castro regime's abuses, Buttigieg seemed exasperated. \"Of course literacy is a good thing,\" he said, \"but why are we spotlighting the literacy programs of a brutal dictator instead of being unambiguous in our condemnation about the way he was treating his own people.\" See the moment: Pete Buttigieg said Monday that he has a simple message for Americans who backed President Donald Trump in 2016: \u201cThis President does not respect you.\u201d The answer came in response to a question about how Buttigieg could convince Trump supporters that he is a better bet than the President. \u201cThe other thing I would say to anybody who voted that way, this\u00a0President doesn't respect you,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThis President thinks you are a\u00a0sucker.\u00a0He thinks you will support him\u00a0while he and his friends laugh\u00a0all the way to the bank.\u00a0Let's do something different and\u00a0do it together.\u201d Buttigieg, throughout his campaign, has made a concerted effort to court what he calls \u201cfuture former Republicans,\u201d people who likely voted for Trump in 2016 but are now disillusioned by the President. \u201cWe're not going to win over\u00a0everybody,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBut I also think there's an opportunity\u00a0to bring a lot of people back\u00a0into the Democratic Party.\u201d Buttigieg added that this is where he sees \u201cthings\u00a0differently from Sen. Sanders.\u201d \u201cI believe we can be true to our\u00a0progressive values and be\u00a0inviting to a lot of people who\u00a0feel politically without a home,\u201d Buttigieg said. Watch: Pete Buttigieg, pressed on why black Americans should support him, said that he \u201crecognizes\u201d and is \u201chumbled\u201d by the fact that he has to earn the support of black voters, something he has struggled to do since announcing his presidential bid. \u201cThis is a vote that has been\u00a0won within living memory.\u00a0It's not just expressing a\u00a0political preference, it is something that was earned\u00a0with blood and sweat and tears,\u201d he said. \u201cI recognize that and I'm humbled\u00a0by that.\u201d Buttigieg went on to say that he \u201crecognize(s)\u201d that he has not had to experience a host of things that impact black America directly because of the color of his skin. \u201cI recognize that I don't have\u00a0that lived experience,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, the question becomes what can\u00a0I do to try to reach out to\u00a0those who do and invite them to\u00a0shape the vision of my campaign and invite them into shaping the\u00a0vision of the White House I\u00a0propose to build.\u201d Buttigieg, for the bulk of his campaign, has struggled to win over black voters, with the issue becoming one that has followed him for months. It is particularly pressing in South Carolina, a state where 60% of the electorate was black in 2016. Buttigieg, in response to a follow-up from CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, said that he wants black voters to support him not just because of what is in his plan, but also because of his \u201cdetermination to make\u00a0sure that we win so we can\u00a0deliver on those.\u201d \u201cI know that nobody is feeling\u00a0the pain of living under the\u00a0presidency of Donald Trump more than\u00a0Americans of color,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd so many voters I talk to are\u00a0laser-focused on making sure we\u00a0defeat the President.\u201d Hear Buttigieg\u2019s answer: Pete Buttigieg said he would focus on making the case for how to defeat President Donald Trump when asked how he would stop Bernie Sanders\u2019 momentum in the presidential race.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Don Lemon said to Buttigieg, \u201cMayor Pete, the crowd loves you, we can\u00a0see.\u00a0They loved you in Indiana, they loved you in Iowa, they loved you in New\u00a0Hampshire. You ran neck and neck with\u00a0Senator Bernie Sanders there.\u201d \u201cBut (Sanders) pulled away in Nevada, where he was a clear front-runner,\u201d Lemon continued.\u00a0\u201cTomorrow night on the debate\u00a0stage you'll have the chance to\u00a0stop his momentum.\u00a0How are you going to do that?\u201d Buttigieg responded, \u201cWell, by making the case for how we\u00a0will defeat Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cLook, I believe in a politics that\u00a0brings as many people in as\u00a0possible.\u00a0I believe in calling people\u00a0into the tent, not calling them\u00a0names online,\u201d the former mayor said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd it's going to be more\u00a0important than ever that we\u00a0build a coalition that can\u00a0invite people -- not just fellow\u00a0die hard Democrats, but Independents. I\u2019m seeing what I call future former\u00a0Republicans who are not going to\u00a0agree on me with everything but\u00a0they\u2019re disgusted with what\u2019s going on in this White House,\u201d Buttigieg continued.\u00a0 Watch: Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has walked on the stage. CNN's Don Lemon is moderating.  Bernie Sanders said it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d that he considered challenging then-President Barack Obama in the 2012 Democratic primary.\u00a0 He called an attack ad from Joe Biden\u2019s campaign -- which highlights a report from The Atlantic that Sanders had considered a run -- \u201cnot true at all\u201d and part of campaign \u201csilly season.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI ended up campaigning for Obama and I\u2019m a strong supporter of all that Barack Obama accomplished,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 \u201cI did not give any consideration to running for president of the United States until 2015,\u201d he said. And that run, he said, came only after he waited to see whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren would run, and she chose not to.\u00a0 See his answer: Bernie Sanders said Monday that his vice-presidential pick would not be \u201can old white guy.\u201d The quip came in response to a voter asking Sanders whether, because of health concerns around him, he would announce a vice presidential nominee sooner rather than later. Sanders had a heart attack in October, leading some voters to question how the 78-year-old lawmaker could be president for four or, possibly, eight years. Sanders said that while he \u201cwill do that,\u201d doing so right now would be \u201ca little\u00a0presumptuous right now.\u201d \u201cI will tell you one thing, that\u00a0person will not be an old white\u00a0guy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat I can say definitively.\u201d Watch: Bernie Sanders on Monday night stood by his qualified praise of Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, again talking up a \"literacy program\" the government launched in its first years. \"There were a lot of folks in Cuba at that point who were illiterate. He formed the literacy brigade,\" Sanders said. \"(Castro) went out and they helped people learn to read and write. You know what, I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing.\" Sanders dismissed the criticism he received from members of Congress as politically motivated. \"If you want to disagree with me, if somebody wants to say \u2013 and by the way, all of those congresspeople that you mentioned just so happen to be supporting other candidates, just accidentally, no doubt. Coincidentally,\" Sanders said. \"But the truth is the truth, and that\u2019s what happened in the first years of the Castro regime.\" Though no names were mentioned, neither Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell or Rep. Donna Shalala, both of South Florida, have formally endorsed any Democratic primary candidate. Sanders also defended his record when it came to opposing corrupt and undemocratic governments around the world. \"I have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world \u2013 including Cuba, including Nicaragua, including Saudi Arabia, including China, including Russia,\" he said. Hear Sen. Sanders' response: Bernie Sanders said that \u201c99.9% of our supporters are fantastic people,\u201d but admitted some are not. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you we don\u2019t have some jerks out there,\u201d he said.\u00a0 But, Sanders added: \u201cI do want to say to those folks: We do not want your support if you think that what our campaign is about is making ugly attacks on other candidates. We don't want you.\u201d\u00a0 The Vermont senator\u2019s comments come amid criticism -- including from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s campaign -- of his supporters\u2019 online tactics.\u00a0 Sanders pointed to attacks on leaders of the Culinary Union, a major Las Vegas union that disagreed with Sanders on health care. He said he thought those attacks might have come from Russians meddling in the election, because he said his supporters would know of his lifelong support for unions.\u00a0 \u201cIt just seemed to be kind of fishy,\u201d he said.\u00a0 See the moment: Bernie Sanders sought to draw a distinction between himself and President Donald Trump, and said he would release a list of how to pay for every proposal he has put forward.\u00a0 At the town hall, the second vice chair of the Charleston County Democrats asked Sanders how his campaign is different from Trump\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m really\u00a0excited about getting a Democrat\u00a0in office, and when I hear you speak I get\u00a0really excited,\u201d Emmanuel Ferguson said. \u201cBut I remember that Trump excited his base with a promise to build a wall with no real plan to pay for it.\u201d Ferguson continued: \u201cYour plan for free college tuition and Medicare for All seems like a way to excite the Democratic base with no real plan to pay for it. Now how is your position and your campaign different from what Donald Trump did? Sanders responded that he has spent his \u201centire adult life\u00a0fighting against everything that\u00a0Trump stands for.\u201d \u201cTrust me, we're\u00a0a little bit different,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 \u201cI thought that question might come up,\u201d Sanders continued, pulling out a piece of paper and handing it to CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. \u201cThis is a list that will be on our website tonight of how we pay for every program that we have developed.\u201d\u00a0 Hear Sen. Sanders\u2019 answer: Bernie Sanders said Monday that if the Democratic Party does not give the nomination to the candidate who has a \u201csubstantial\u00a0plurality\u201d of delegates headed into the convention, it would lead to a \u201cserious, serious problem\u201d for the party and could \u201cwreak havoc on that person\u2019s campaign.\u201d The issue is becoming a real one for the Democratic Party: With so many candidates still running for president, it is increasingly a possibility that none of the candidates will be able to secure the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to win on the first ballot. \u201cIf I, or anybody else, goes into the Democratic\u00a0convention with a substantial\u00a0plurality, I believe that\u00a0individual, me or anybody else,\u00a0should be the candidate of the\u00a0Democratic Party,\u201d Sanders said. Democrats were asked this question during last week\u2019s debate and only Sanders said the candidates with a plurality should be the winner, while others said the rules of the convention allowing second and third balloting should play out. Sanders said Monday that not giving the nomination to the candidate with a substantial plurality would be a \u201cserious, serious problem.\u201d \u201cAll of the candidates are\u00a0working really hard.\u00a0And if one candidate comes out on\u00a0top, to say to the country, \u2018You\u00a0voted for that candidate, but by\u00a0the way we don't think that\u00a0candidate should be the nominee,\u2019\u00a0I think that would be a\u00a0serious, serious problem for the\u00a0Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it would wreak havoc on that person\u2019s campaign.\u201d Watch: Bernie Sanders called it \u201ctotal nonsense\u201d to suggest he can\u2019t work with Republicans.\u00a0 He touted writing \u201cone of the most sweeping veterans bills in history\u201d with former Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, as well as leading an effort along with Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to end the US role in the war in Yemen.\u00a0 \u201cThe idea I can't work with people is one of those myths that keeps popping up as the election day comes closer,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 His answer came after Sanders was asked about Democratic presidential rival Pete Buttigieg characterizing him as inflexible. Sanders said the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor\u2019s ideology is shaped by his fundraising from wealthy donors.\u00a0 See the moment: Bernie Sanders rejected the idea on Monday night that he is too radical by, at one point, using a call and response with the audience to demonstrate that his views are in line with Democratic voters. \u201cNot only all Democrats, a whole lot of independents and some\u00a0Republicans understand that it\u00a0is absolutely imperative that we defeat this extremely\u00a0dangerous President,\u201d Sanders said before pointing to polls that show he can defeat Donald Trump. Sanders built to the crescendo of his answer by taking on the idea that he is extreme. \u201cI know if you look at the\u00a0media, they say Bernie\u2019s ideas\u00a0are radical, they are extreme, they are out of mainstream,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cLet me just tell you, I don\u2019t think that is true.\u201d He then added: \u201cIs raising the minimum wage\u00a0to $15 an hour a radical idea?\u201d The audience responded with a \u201cNo!\u201d Sanders continued this back and forth with his policies on free college for all and guaranteeing health care. \u201cI rest my case,\u201d Sanders concluded. Hear Sen. Sanders\u2019 answer: Bernie Sanders said he is ready to take the debate stage Tuesday night after wins in Nevada and New Hampshire have made him a target of his fellow 2020 contenders.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked Sanders, \u201cSo, you are the front runner.\u00a0You\u2019ve had the results, you clearly\u00a0have energy, and now along with\u00a0it you will have the target.\u201d \u201cA representative of the\u00a0Bloomberg campaign said there\u2019s one\u00a0person who matters on the debate\u00a0stage tomorrow night and that is\u00a0Bernie Sanders,\" Cuomo continued. \"Are you ready\u00a0for that pressure?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\" Sanders responded.\u00a0 \"You know, given the fact that I have been\u00a0in opposition my entire career, that I\u2019ve taken on every special\u00a0interest, it is a little bit funny to find\u00a0myself as the so-called front-runner.\"  \u201cBut, look, we are going to enter this debate\u00a0with the full knowledge that\u00a0tens of millions of Americans\u00a0want fundamental change in terms\u00a0of what is going on in this\u00a0country,\" the senator continued. \"They're tired of a President who\u00a0is a pathological liar.\u201d Watch the moment: Bernie Sanders has staked a large portion of his political appeal on his consistency over four decades. But on the question of gun control, he has moved decidedly to the left over the past two decades. In the early 1990s he repeatedly voted against the Brady Bill, which eventually passed and created a waiting period for handgun purchases.  It was a position his rivals now -- and in the past -- have pointed to as being key to his ascent.  Pressed about his past positions on Monday night, Sanders again pointed to his evolution on the issue and noted his D- rating from the NRA -- one he said would \"get even worse\" if he became president. Sanders also noted that, despite voting years ago for a bill exempting gun manufacturers from certain lawsuits, that he is now attached to legislation that would undo it. \"What is very clear to me is that there is a growing consensus in this country \u2013 I\u2019m not going to tell you that everyone agrees on every nuance \u2013 but there is a growing consensus between gun owners, non-gun owners, rural states like mine and urban states about several things,\" Sanders said. They included: a push for universal background checks; keeping guns out of the hands of people with a \"violent past\"; ending the \"gun show loophole\"; and banning the sale and distribution of assault weapons. Watch: Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders has taken the stage. CNN's Chris Cuomo is moderating.  Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0offered a partial defense of\u00a0Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution, asserting that \"It's unfair to simply say everything is bad\" with the way the late despot ruled the country. \"We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad. You know?\" Sanders said on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" in an interview that aired Sunday. \"When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?\" The comments \u2014 which could prove to alienate some moderate Democrats as\u00a0Sanders' chases the party's primary nomination\u00a0\u2014 came in response to a question about remarks Sanders had made in the 1980s assessing that the Cuban people didn't rise up against Castro because of education and healthcare. When host Anderson Cooper pointed to the notable number of dissidents imprisoned in Cuba, Sanders responded, \"That's right. And we condemn that. \"Unlike Donald Trump, let's be clear, you want to \u2014 I do not think that Kim Jong Un is a good friend,\" he said. \"I don't trade love letters with a murdering dictator. Vladimir Putin, not a great friend of mine.\" Castro, who died in 2016, drew scores of admirers and detractors as he clung to a socialist economic model and one-party Communist rule, even after the Soviet Union disintegrated. Sanders' comments drew pushback online Sunday night, including from Democratic Rep. Donna Shalala of Florida who tweeted, \"I'm hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro.\" Keep reading.
