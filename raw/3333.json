The Pennsylvania Senate voted 29-21 Wednesday local time to pass a bill that would require the governor to implement a plan for businesses physically operating in the state to reopen and allow their employees to go back to work. According to the bill\u2019s wording, the mitigation plan for business and industry \u201cwould need to be developed using recommended guidance for mitigating exposure to Covid-19 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d The bill now heads to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s desk. Pennsylvania\u2019s Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Saturday that reopening businesses would be premature. \u201cI understand the legislature\u2019s concern about the economy and desire to stimulate the economy but now is not the time,\u201d Levine said. \u201cIt\u2019s the time for people to stay home.\u201d Pennsylvania has reported least 26,753 coronavirus cases, including 779 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. ##Daily Life## Two additional members of the New York Police Department have died related to the coronavirus, the Police Commissioner of the City of New York, Dermot Shea tweeted Wednesday night. \u201cWith profound sadness, I inform you of the loss of two additional members of our NYPD family,\u201d Shea tweeted. \"Detective Robert Cardona & Traffic Enforcement Agent Carol Ryer lost their battles with #COVID19 today. The hearts of all members of the NYPD are heavy as we vow to #NeverForget.\u201d Detective Cardona worked in the 13th\u00a0Precinct and Ryer worked in the Bronx Traffic Enforcement division, according to the NYPD. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti outlined five principles the city will use for reopening in a news conference on Wednesday. He said this is consistent with what California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Tuesday. Getting back to normal will take time but the more we do now, the sooner it will come, Garcetti said. The five pillars Mayor Garcetti talked about in his plans to reopen the city are as follows: Strong system of testing for coronavirus\nReal time surveillance to detect and prevent new outbreaks\nImmediately respond to new cases with an aggressive approach\nHospital capacity, specifically the ability to handle a surge in cases\nOngoing research and development He added that the city needed clear guidelines in place to prepare for a second or even third wave of cases. The state of California has reported at least 26,837 coronavirus cases, including 865 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. ##Daily Life## Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last month he had obtained more than 1,000 ventilators to help California hospitals treating patients infected with the coronavirus, an effort Gov. Gavin Newsom hailed as \u201cheroic.\u201d  Now, more than three weeks later, the governor\u2019s office says none of the promised ventilators have been received by hospitals. At a March 23 news conference, Newsom said the devices, which can provide life-saving support to patients infected with the virus, had already arrived in Los Angeles and were on their way to hospitals in need. \"I told you a few days ago that he was likely to have 1,000 ventilators this week,\" Newsom said. \"They've arrived in Los Angeles, and Elon Musk is already working with hospital association and others to get those ventilators out. It\u2019s a heroic effort.\" Shortly after the dramatic announcement, Musk said in a\u00a0tweet: \u201cChina had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!\u201d But despite the claims, none of the ventilators promised by Musk have been delivered to hospitals. \u201cElon Musk and his team told the state that he had procured ventilators and wanted to distribute them directly to hospitals with shortages,\u201d a spokesperson for the California governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cThe Administration is communicating every day with hospitals across the state about their ventilator supply and to date we have not heard of any hospital system that has received a ventilator directly from Tesla or Musk.\u201d Spokespersons for Tesla did not return CNN requests for comment. The news was first reported by the\u00a0Sacramento Bee. Some background: Major US companies like Ford and Apple have also announced plans to produce ventilators and donate face masks for health care workers treating patients infected with the virus. Last week,\u00a0Newsom reassured residents that California now has enough ventilators to meet its projected needs, after some questioned his decision to lend 500 machines to other states in crisis.\u00a0 ##Health## Days after declaring that his authority over the states is total, President Trump threatened Wednesday to apply a never used provision of the US Constitution to allow him to adjourn the US Congress and push through many of his nominees who typically require Senate confirmation. \u201cAs the entire US government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed, and we\u2019re not allowing that to take place through our Congress,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not giving it to us. We have many positions that are unstaffed because we can\u2019t get approval.\u201d Trump said there were 129 nominees \u201cstuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction.\u201d Trump\u2019s argument seemed to be that many of these vacancies needed to be filled to assist with the coronavirus response, including the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department and an Undersecretary of Agriculture. The President argued that since the Senate has left until May 4, \u201cthe Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances. The recess appointment, it\u2019s called. The Senate\u2019s practice of gaveling into so-called pro-forma sessions where no one is even there has prevented me from using the Constitutional authority we\u2019re given,\u201d Trump said, calling on the Senate to formally adjourn. The decision to stay away from Washington until May 4 was made, and announced, by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and close Trump ally. A McConnell spokesman said Trump and McConnell spoke about the issue today. \u201cThe Leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered mission-critical to the Covid-19 pandemic, but under Senate rules that will take consent from Leader Schumer.\" That last point is an important one. McConnell, who is careful with his words, appears to be saying any solution to the confirmation issue will require Democratic consent. The Constitution allows a president to fill temporary appointments during a recess, without congressional approval. But lawmakers in both parties have sought to thwart certain appointments over the last decade by never technically\u00a0shutting down the Senate. When then-President Barack Obama attempted to make recess appointments during pro-forma sessions in 2014, the US Supreme Court ruled \"that the Recess Appointment Clause does not give the President the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue.\" Justice Stephen Breyer said, \"We hold that the Senate is in session, and not in recess, when the Senate says that it is in session. However, tonight Trump said he may use powers granted to the executive branch in order to get Congress to return to Washington to fill vacancies and vote on relief aid. \u201cI have a very strong power. I\u2019d rather not use that power but we have way over a 100 people that we very badly need in this administration that should have been approved a long time ago,\" he said. The Constitution says the President \"may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.\"\u00a0The Court did not rule on that clause, as it was never invoked by the Obama administration or any prior administration. Given the authority has never been invoked before, it\u2019s murky as to what would define \u201cdisagreement\u201d in this case. Both chambers would technically need to adjourn to clear the way for recess appointments, and the Democratic-led House is exceedingly unlikely to hold a vote to adjourn. That means McConnell would likely have to bring senators back to Washington to vote to adjourn in order to create the \u201cdisagreement\u201d cited in the Constitution that would provide the grounds for Trump to act. The Senate has been out of Washington out of concern over the safety of senators due to the pandemic. Trump, as he sought to explain his consideration of the action, took special note of Michael Pack, the President\u2019s choice to lead the Broadcasting Board of Governors, whose organization doesn\u2019t hold a clear role in the federal government\u2019s coronavirus health or economic response. Trump specifically cited his nomination to head the board of Voice of America as a particular grievance in not getting appointed, and continued to attack the news organization. \u201cHe\u2019s been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America, very important. And if you\u2019ve heard what\u2019s coming out of the Voice of America, it\u2019s disgusting. The things they say are disgusting toward our country,\u201d Trump said of Pack. Trump did not explain how the nominee to be CEO of the US Agency for Global Media would enhance federal efforts to counter the pandemic. But he reiterated his threat to adjourn both chambers of Congress several times.\u00a0 \u201cIf they don\u2019t approve it, we\u2019re gonna go this route,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cWe are going to do something that will be something I prefer not doing.\u201d There are at least\u00a0636,350\ufffd\ufffdcases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a0at least\u00a028,326\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States. On Wednesday, Johns Hopkins reported\u00a027,110\u00a0new cases and\u00a02,293\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases. ##Health## \u00a0 US stock futures were down in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the Dow and S&P logged their worst trading day since April 1. Dow futures were down 157 points, or about 0.6%. S&P 500 futures were down about 0.7% and Nasdaq futures were down about 0.7%.\u00a0 Stocks plummeted on Wednesday following a plethora of negative economic data and weak earnings.\u00a0 The Dow dipped 445 points, or 1.9%. The S&P dropped 2.2% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.4%, paring its longest four-day winning streak since early February. Both the Dow and S&P 500 logged its worst day since April 1.\u00a0 Bank of America and Citigroup saw weak bank earnings as they prepare for loan defaults incurred from the pandemic. Bank of America's first quarter profits dropped by 45%. The bank announced on Wednesday it has set aside $4.8 billion for credit losses linked to the virus. Economic data released on Wednesday also saw sharp declines. Retail sales in March tumbled 8.7%, the worst monthly decline since the department began tracking data in 1992. Thursday's weekly jobless claims report is expected to post another 5.1 million people who have filed for unemployment benefits. ##Business## Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said rapid testing will be key to determining when emergency restrictions can be lifted.\u00a0 \u201cWe're not at a level that we can take off social distancing, nor are we extremely close to a level that we can take off social distancing,\" he said. Inslee said he will make that decision on his own timetable without waiting for authorization from President Trump.\u00a0 \u201cWe actually have authorization,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cThat comes from our Constitution and the US Constitution.\u201d He said he wasn't sure, unlike Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, whether he would say there won't be a public event this year in Washington. \u201cI wish I had a crystal ball to say when, why, what game, what day, what sport,\u201d he said. \u201cI can't do that.\u201d ##Daily Life## \u00a0 Dairy farmers in California are now being forced to dump milk due to an enormous decrease in demand with schools and restaurants remaining closed during the statewide stay-at-home order. As the shelter-in-place orders increased throughout the month of March and restaurants were forced to close, 50% of the customer base was eliminated almost overnight, according to Western United Dairies CEO Anja Raudabaugh, who represents over 860 dairy farm families in California. Restaurant chains like TGI Friday\u2019s and Applebee\u2019s are huge customers of the dairy industry, but they stopped placing orders in the middle of March, Raudabaugh said. The demand also significantly decreased with school closures and the lunch programs shutting down. While schools are still delivering drive-through meals, the demand is not even close to what it was, Raudabaugh said.  California dairy farmers saw the biggest impact from these two sectors and it caused a tremendous amount of distribution challenges. Plants are now running at about 150% of their capacity, according to Raudabaugh. \u201cThey have milk coming out of their eyes and ears,\" she said. ##Daily Life## The College Board announced on Wednesday that they are preparing to make a digital version of the SAT available to take at home in the event that students cannot return to school in September. \u201cWe know students and educators are worried about how the coronavirus may disrupt the college admissions process, and we want to do all we can to help alleviate that anxiety during this very demanding time,\u201d said College Board CEO David Coleman in a statement. \u201cOur first principle with the SAT and all our work must be to keep families and students safe. The second principle is to make the SAT as widely available as possible for students who wish to test, regardless of the economic or public health circumstances.\u201d\u00a0 The College Board has already made AP testing available at home, and said they equally would ensure that \u201cat-home SAT testing is simple; secure and fair; accessible to all; and valid for use in college admissions.\u201d Making the SAT available at home is just one of the three scenarios the College Board is planning for. The College Board\u00a0shared that if it is safe to do so, there will be weekend SAT administration every month through the end of the calendar year beginning in August. They also said it would administer SAT testing in the fall, since testing through schools was canceled this spring. ##Daily Life## President Trump was pressed Wednesday by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on reports that business leaders told him on a call today that testing needs to ramp up before Americans go back to work, echoing his health officials. Trump said he also wanted widespread testing, but passed the buck to the nation\u2019s governors, many of whom have been looking to the federal government for testing support. \u201cIt\u2019s what I want, too. We have great tests and we want the states to administer these tests for the most part, but we\u2019re standing behind them. We have great tests, we\u2019ve done more testing now than any country in the world,\u201d he said naming two health care companies. He continued: \u201cWe will be working very much with the governors of the states. We want them to do it. We\u2019re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas, we\u2019re not going to be running a parking lot where you have a Walmart\u2026 but you have a testing center and running that from Washington, DC. The states are much better equipped to do it. But we\u2019ll be working with the states. We\u2019re standing behind the states. We\u2019re going to work very closely with the governors in terms of that, getting additional equipment.\u201d Trump also warned that the federal government can take \u201cstrong action, including a closedown\u201d if he is unhappy with a governor\u2019s actions. Asked when drive-through tests will be more widespread and available to Americans \u2013 not just those health care workers and others on the frontlines, Trump said it would be determined by a combination of states, companies, and the federal government.\u00a0 \u201cI think the companies will determine that, and the governors will determine that, and the federal government will do and if we\u2019re not happy we\u2019ll take very strong action against a state or a governor.\u201d Watch: ##Health##\u00a0 President Trump said during Wednesday\u2019s press briefing that he doesn\u2019t think printing his name on the paper stimulus checks going out to millions of Americans is \u201ca big deal,\u201d adding that the addition is \u201cnot delaying anything.\u201d \u201cWell I don\u2019t know too much about it, but I understand my name is there. I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going, how they\u2019re going. I do understand it\u2019s not delaying anything. And I\u2019m satisfied. I don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a big deal. I\u2019m sure people will be very happy to get a big fat beautiful check and my name is on it,\u201d Trump said in the White House Rose Garden. Some background: Two senior Treasury officials told The Washington Post, which\u00a0first reported\u00a0the decision, that the move will probably set back the delivery date on the first set of paper checks \u2014 potentially slowing a process that could already take up to 20 weeks. The Internal Revenue Service, however, insists that the move will not result in a delay. Watch: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum announced Wednesday 24 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the highest daily increase in North Dakota since the pandemic began. Burgum also revealed a backlog of 400 Covid-19 tests in the state lab and warned, \u201cIt\u2019s likely our biggest days of cases are still ahead of us, not behind us.\u201d ##Health## Dr. Deborah Birx said Wednesday that Providence, Rhode Island, has re-emerged as an area of concern for the coronavirus task force due to its location between two hotspots.\u00a0 \u201cI do want to highlight, and we are remaining concerned, and we are remaining concerned and we\u2019ve been having discussions with Rhode Island. Rhode Island and Providence are in a unique situation. First, they had increasing cases from the New York City area, and now they have new increasing cases from the Boston area,\u201d she said. Rhode Island, Birx said, is \u201ccaught between two incredible hotspots in the country,\u201d and though they are \u201cdoing an extraordinary job carrying for individuals on the front line, Providence continues to have new cases.\u201d She continued to encourage Americans to practice social distancing and noted that there are nine states with \u201cless than a thousand cases.\u201d Watch: ##Health## President Trump said Wednesday that new guidelines regarding preventing the spread of coronavirus while reopening the economy will be announced at a news conference Thursday.\u00a0 Trump announced that data \u201csuggests that nationwide, we are past the peak on new cases,\u201d citing flattening of the curve in Detroit and Denver, new cases declining in New York, and \u201cgreat progress\u201d in Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. \u201cThese encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country, which we\u2019ll be announcing. We\u2019re going to be talking about that tomorrow, we\u2019ll be having a news conference tomorrow sometime during the afternoon. We\u2019re going to be announcing guidelines and we\u2019ll be talking about various states and it's very exciting,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 As CNN has reported, the new recommendations would mimic the social distancing guidelines the President announced in March and extended at the start of April, while not mandatory, they carry the weight of the federal government and the presidency. The comments come the same day Trump was told by many business stakeholders that more testing was needed in order for Americans to return to work. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said he is extending his executive order that closes nonessential businesses in the state through April 30. Burgum said he hopes the state could begin to reopen May 1 but added \"plans can change.\" There are at least\u00a0632,878\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a0at least\u00a027,850\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. On Wednesday, Johns Hopkins reported\u00a023,638\u00a0new cases and\u00a01,817\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told CNN's Wolf Blitzer concerts and sporting events will not be allowed in the city until 2021. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret plan that got leaked,\u201d Garcetti said on \"The Situation Room,\" referring to an internal letter obtained by the Los Angeles Times. Garcetti said unless there is a vaccine or a pharmaceutical intervention, there won't be mass gatherings like concerts and sporting events in Los Angeles until next year. Watch: Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called on Washington to pass a second relief package, specifically to help state government revenue shortfalls. \u201cThis is a public health crisis, but it is accompanied by massive economic disruption that's unprecedented in modern history,\u201d Pritzker said at a briefing on Wednesday He said state budget experts estimate that there will be a $2.7. billion shortfall of revenues for this fiscal year, and a $4.6 billion shortfall for next fiscal year. \u201cI want to express my gratitude to our Illinois congressional delegation, our senators and congressmen of both parties for their support for the first CARES Act ... But I want to be clear, these dollars can be used to cover only new expenditures related to coronavirus,\" he said.  The bill provides funds to cover state government expenditures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. \"Currently this funding cannot be used to make up for state government revenue shortfalls that have been a result of coronavirus. That leaves states to face this unprecedented financial hole on their own, if the Congress doesn't pass a \u2018CARES Act 2,\u2019 to support state governments,\" Pritzker said. \u201cThe federal government acted swiftly to step in and support businesses and corporations so that they can come out on the other side of this and jumpstart the economy. But the same type of action is needed in support of state governments,\u201d the governor said. ##Daily Life## Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned again Wednesday that the national lockdown would continue for weeks to come even though the country has, so far, been spared the worst of Covid-19. \"If we reopen too soon, everything we're doing\u00a0now might be for nothing,\u201d Trudeau said during his daily press conference in Ottawa. Canada reported 28,205 cases on Wednesday and 1,008 deaths.\u00a0Nearly half of those deaths were related to outbreaks in long-term care facilities. Still, per capita, Canada has had fewer cases and deaths than the United States and most European countries. But Trudeau says that doesn\u2019t mean the country is reopening anytime soon, and certainly not by May 1. \"It would be terrible if we were to release restrictions too early and find out we're suddenly back in another big wave of Covid-19,\" he said, adding that any reopening would happen in phases. ##Health## CNN\u00a0is collecting\u00a0your questions\u00a0for former Vice President Joe\u00a0Biden who will participate in Thursday's global town hall on coronavirus.

Ned Lamont will issue new guidelines for wearing masks in public spaces which will \"likely be reflected in an executive order within 48 hours,\" he said in a\u00a0news briefing in Hartford on Wednesday.\u00a0 Lamont said the decision came after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\u00a0 \"It's time for us to be also really strict about the need to wear a mask, even masks you make yourself, just a bandana, a scarf, or a surgical mask,\" he said. ##Daily Life## New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has extended the city's stay-at-home order until May 16, her office announced Wednesday. The mayor signed the proclamation Wednesday extending the order and prohibiting gatherings. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she thinks any discussions on reopening the economy must be based on health care and science.  \"The numbers are staggering but\u00a0each individual story is\u00a0heartbreaking to hear.\u00a0So as we have discussions about\u00a0how we open up our economy, this\u00a0or that, we understand that this\u00a0is an assault on the lives and\u00a0the livelihoods of the American\u00a0people, and that any decision to\u00a0open up would be one that should\u00a0be science-based and\u00a0health-care-based,\" she told CNN. Pelosi went on to say that's why testing is critical. She added that more than a month later, the US still doesn't have\u00a0\"the appropriate, adequate\u00a0testing\" to identify the challenge. \"So really we have been delinquent. We have to have a change in\u00a0that,\" she said.\u00a0\"It's one thing to say well, it wasn't\u00a0done right.\u00a0But there's no excuse for us to\u00a0not do it right as we go\u00a0forward.\u00a0It's so obvious.\u00a0Almost sinful.\" Watch: ##Health## For the second day in a row, Los Angeles County is reporting more coronavirus-related deaths than ever before.

Larry Hogan announced Wednesday an executive order mandating face coverings in public for people in retail establishments or riding on public transportation.\u00a0 The order comes on the heels of Maryland\u2019s deadliest 48 hours of the pandemic, with 87 people reported dead so far this week. Hogan urged leaders in Washington \u201cto put aside partisan politics\u201d and warned that without additional federal action states could face \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked the Trump administration to support the governors and states, and ask for their help in breaking this logjam in the US Senate so that we can continue working together to fight this pandemic and to get our states and our economies back on track,\u201d Hogan said. Maryland now has 10,032 confirmed Covid-19 cases, and 311 deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. ##Health## ##Travel## California\u2019s undocumented workers who have been forced out of work as a result of the pandemic will be eligible for payments in a new private-public partnership announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The workers are not eligible for federal stimulus payments. Undocumented workers make up about 10% of California\u2019s workforce, Newsom said. Because these workers pay approximately $2.5 billion in state and local taxes, Newsom has signed a Direct Disaster Assistance order, which will provide up to $500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for families. The state will provide $75 million to fund the program and private philanthropists will give $50 million.\u00a0Some philanthropic foundations that have signed on to donate include the Emerson Collective, the Zuckerberg Chan Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, and Blue Shield Foundation. ##Daily Life## New York has reported an additional 11,571 coronavirus cases, bringing the statewide total to 213,779 confirmed cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office said in a statement Wednesday. Cuomo previously announced\u00a0752 people died from coronavirus on Tuesday in New York. ##Health## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now including confirmed and probable coronavirus case and death counts on their websites.\u00a0Previously, the CDC was only counting confirmed and presumptive positive cases.\u00a0 \u201cThis change was made to reflect an interim Covid-19 position statement issued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made Covid-19 a nationally notifiable disease,\u201d its website says.\u00a0\u00a0 The CDC is reporting 605,390 cases of novel coronavirus in the United States.\u00a0The agency says at least 24,582 people have died.\u00a0 CNN relies on Johns Hopkins University for its tally and won\u2019t always match the CDC\u2019s count. Johns Hopkins has reported 613,187 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US and 26,950 deaths. \u00a0##Health## US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, after weak economic data and earnings weighed on the market all day. Energy stocks led losses, after oil settled below $20 a barrel for the first time since 2002. The Dow finished down 1.9%, or 445 points, and the S&P 500 fell 2.2%. It was the worst day for the two indexes since April 1. The Nasdaq Composite broke a four-day winning streak, its longest since early February. The index closed down 1.4%. Remember: As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. ##Business## Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, emphasized the need for mitigation to combat the pandemic in the US. Wolf, speaking to the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee on Wednesday, said he wanted to \u201cemphasize some very basic things, and that is mitigation works, so we're not going to test our way out of this.\" He added that washing your hands, not touching your face and ensuring social distancing are key. Wolf said the department is urging the preservation of personal protection equipment so that doctors hospitals and nursing homes can make them last longer than that one time.\u00a0 \u201cInstead of having that gown or that mask or this glove, being a 70 cent pair of gloves, we need them to be a $100 pair of gloves and we need those facilities to start treating those gloves or those masks or those respirators much, much differently,\u201d Wolf said. He also said the department is working to accelerate supplies to meet demand, touting the use of Federal Emergency Management Agency's Air Bridge. Some context: As of April 14, there were about 44 flights with another 56 that are scheduled, he said. DHS is working with about five or six medical distributors, whose PPE is already destined for the US. \u201cWhat we're trying to do is we're trying to get it here quicker. And then we're trying to make sure that we allocate it to those hotspots, as well as their traditional supply chain,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Wolf said DHS is also involved in domestic efforts to alter supply lines and shift to mask and other personal protective equipment\u00a0production, as well as proper allocation of supplies. He said that companies have given the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Defense unprecedented insight into their supply chains. ##Health## The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released \u201cdemographic characteristics of Covid-19 cases in the United States\u201d on its website Wednesday. The newly published information details the race and age of coronavirus cases in the United States as of April 14. On Wednesday, the CDC reported more than 605,000 cases of coronavirus, but the demographics are only listed for 398,852 cases. A majority of the cases, in some instances, up to 85%, the CDC lists \u201cunspecified\u201d or \u201cmissing\u201d as the age and race.\u00a0 Here are some of the findings from the CDC: Of the cases, a majority are in the 18-44 and 45-64 age ranges\n73% of the cases fall between 18-64\n90,619 cases are those over the age of 65\n80% of the cases listed under white are over the age of 65\n34% of the cases listed in the 45-64 age group are black or African American ##Health## In the first phone call convened between President Trump and some members of his newly formed business council, industry leaders reiterated to the President what public health experts and governors have been telling him for weeks: that there would need to be guarantees of ramped up coronavirus testing before people would return to work, according to one person briefed on the discussions.\u00a0 The call, one of a series being held with various sectors on Wednesday, was the first task force teleconference aimed at devising a strategy for reopening the country.  The call lasted for about an hour and had dozens of participants from the banking, food, hospitality and retail sectors, many of whom lauded the President and his administration for their efforts to combat coronavirus and jumpstart the economy, this person said. Many of Trump\u2019s conservative allies have encouraged him to listen to advice from business leaders, hopeful their recommendations on reopening parts of the country will counterbalance the advice of public health experts like Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, who convinced Trump to extend social distancing guidelines by another month at the start of April. Those allies are convinced internal discussions on the coronavirus task force, and the information it provides the President, are overly weighted toward models and worst-case public health scenarios. They had hoped another panel inside the White House focused on the economic effects of the pandemic might lend equilibrium. Some of Trump\u2019s advisers also hoped having the imprimatur of American industry on White House decision-making might lend credibility \u2014 and cover \u2014 to whatever decision Trump announces on how and when to recommend reopening certain portions of the country, which some fear could lead to new outbreaks if rushed out too quickly. But uncertainty about the new task force prevailed from nearly the moment Trump said he was considering in on April 5.\u00a0 Watch: ##Business## ##Health## There are 698 members of the New York City Fire Department who are currently positive for Covid-19, Jim Long, a spokesperson for the department, told CNN. The number includes firefighters, EMS and civilian personnel. There are approximately 2,500 members of the FDNY on medical leave currently, which includes non-Covid-related illnesses or injuries. ##Health## Turkey has recorded its highest number of daily Covid-19 mortalities for a second day in a row with 115 deaths, according to the latest figures released by the Turkish health ministry on Wednesday.

San Francisco is unveiling a program to streamline coronavirus contact tracing as part of its response to the pandemic. The partnership with the city, public health department, University of California, San Francisco, and\u00a0DIMAGI, a company working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is an effort to digitize workflow and monitoring. \u201cThis collaboration serves as a powerful example of what we can achieve when we bring together the best minds across our public health system, with the City, academic medical centers and community partners,\u201d said Dr. Sam Hawgood, chancellor of UCSF. \u201cUCSF and our county health partners have worked together on every major health crisis our city has faced, reaching back to 1873, including caring for victims of the 1906 earthquake, cholera, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. We are here to serve patients during the Covid pandemic and will be here to help our city rebuild on the other side.\u201d Contacts will receive text messages or phone calls monitoring their health during a 14-day period. The program will also allow them to self-report and public health officials will be immediately alerted. ##Health## \u00a0 Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has extended his order closing recreation and entertainment businesses, as well as personal care services, and banning gatherings of more than 10 people, through May 8.\u00a0 According to Northam, Virginia\u2019s \u201cStay at Home\u201d order remains in effect until June 10. The governor said at this time, he doesn\u2019t plan to extend that order from that point, but emphasized, that it remains a fluid situation and that decisions are being made on a day-to-day basis. Virginia is reporting 329 new cases of Covid-19 today, bringing the total number of cases to 6,500. The state is also reporting 41 new deaths, for a total of 195 Covid-19 related deaths, which is a big jump from the last report, according to Virginia State Health Commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver. Oliver noted, however, that death surveillance is not done in real time, and that the new large number of deaths is a correction in their data reporting, where many of those deaths are from a prior time, with information just now coming in on those. According to the health commissioner, the state\u2019s data on racial and ethnic categories remains incomplete, but of the available data, 30% of the total cases are African American, and 35% of the deaths are African American. Northam also spoke about thinking ahead to what a new normal may look like in days ahead, saying \u201cright now, that new normal will probably look like covering you face, spending more time at home, telework, if you can, continuing to use social distancing, and to stay away from large gathering.\u201d ##Daily Life## ##Health## Starting at midnight tonight, Los Angeles residents will be required to wear a face covering or mask while venturing out for essential services, County Supervisor Kathryn Barger told CNN. \u201cMasks clearly are something that I think is here, and I believe is going to be here for a while,\u201d Barger said. About sporting events and other mass gatherings, Barger said she believes they are unlikely until a vaccine for coronavirus is available. When it comes to bars and nightclubs, Barger said, \u201cI think that\u2019s way out there.\u201d\u00a0 Fitness centers and gyms are also probably low on the list for reopening but many construction projects are considered essential and still working within social distancing guidelines.\u00a0 \"Masks definitely are going to be and are a must at all construction sites,\u201d Barger said. ##Daily Life## ##Health## A total of 17,167 people in France have died after contracting coronavirus while the number of national hospitalizations has declined,\u00a0France's director-general of Health J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon confirmed Wednesday. Although the latest death toll figures mark an increase of 1,438 from Tuesday\u2019s confirmed total of\u00a015,729, Salomon\u00a0clarified that the increase also reflects an adjustment in data, rather than an actual increase in deaths over the last 24 hours.\u00a0 Despite this increase in deaths,\u00a0Salomon also\u00a0highlighted that\u00a0France has \u2013 for the first time since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 registered a decline in the number of hospitalized patients.\u00a0 \"There are 513 fewer people hospitalized since yesterday. This is the first decrease in hospitalizations,\u201d Salomon said during a news conference, confirming that there are currently 31,779 patients receiving treatment in hospitals across France.\u00a0\"We should applaud this decrease while remaining careful.\" ##Health## The British government says that based on national data it is beginning to see a \u201cflattened curve\u201d for new Covid-19 cases, adding that containment measures appear to be having a positive effect on the trajectory of the outbreak.\u00a0 \"What I see here is evidence that everybody\u2019s efforts to stay home and not have as much contact with other people, as would be normal, is having the impact that we hoped it would have and bringing this epidemic to a much better trajectory where this is currently flat and no longer rising,\u201d said Angela McLean, UK deputy chief scientific adviser, during a news conference at Downing Street.\u00a0 According to McLean, hospital admissions fell by 1% across the country on Tuesday, and by 5% in the Greater London area. \u00a0 Speaking alongside McLean, the UK\u2019s Chief Medical Adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, said he believes the UK is \u201cprobably reaching the peak overall\u201d in the trajectory of the national coronavirus outbreak.   But he warned the country could still see an uptick in the number of daily deaths. \u201cSadly, we do think that high numbers of deaths will continue for certainly a short while on from where we are at the moment,\" Whitty said.  \"We are not yet at the point where we can say confidently and safely that we are now past the peak,\u201d he added.\u00a0 ##Health## Idaho's governor said nonessential businesses can \"prepare to reopen after April 30\" by developing a number of operational plans over the next couple weeks.\u00a0 \"Many nonessential businesses can also prepare to reopen after April 30 by developing operational plans over the next two weeks to do the following things,\" such as maintaining physical distancing and providing protection for employees and citizens, Little said. Little's amended order also requires out-of-state travelers to self-quarantine for 14 days after entering Idaho, excluding those performing essential services. ##Health## ##Daily Life## There are at least\u00a0613,187\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and at least\u00a026,950\u00a0people have died from the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. On Wednesday, Johns Hopkins reported\u00a03,947\u00a0new cases and\u00a0917\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all repatriated cases. ##Health## Nearly a third of nurses in Spain \u2014 up to 70,000\u00a0\u2014 could have\u00a0been infected with Covid-19, according to\u00a0preliminary findings in\u00a0a new study from the Spanish College of Nursing. Almost 30% of the nurses surveyed by email said they had symptoms of Covid-19 infection, the professional body for the Spanish nursing profession said. Around 75% of nurses who responded to the\u00a0ongoing study\u00a0believed they had been exposed to the infection in the workplace, with around 35% putting this down to a lack\u00a0of personal protective equipment. The Spanish government says 27,758 health care workers have tested positive for coronavirus to date, about 15% of all cases in the hard-hit country.\u00a0A number of health workers, including doctors, have died. The Spanish College of Nursing has more than 300,000 members. \u00a0##Health## \u00a0 The US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday issued emergency use authorizations for two new coronavirus antibody tests, which are able to detect past infections after people have recovered. A total of three tests are now authorized by the agency, which determined that the benefits of using the quickly-designed tests during the pandemic outweigh the risks \u2013 such as false negatives or false positives. The tests, which use blood samples instead of a swab, are limited to use in authorized laboratories. Instead of looking for traces of the virus, they look for our body\u2019s response to the virus: antibodies. The FDA, though, is warning that the tests could lead to false negatives, since antibodies aren\u2019t present at the earliest stages of infection. \u201cA negative result may occur if you are tested early in your illness and your body hasn\u2019t had time to produce antibodies to infection,\u201d the agency said in fact sheets published Wednesday. While the tests may miss some recent infections, experts say they\u2019re useful to understand how widespread the coronavirus really is \u2013 since they should be able to detect past infections, even if people had few or no symptoms. It\u2019s unclear how long immunity might last after someone recovers from Covid-19, but the antibody tests could also offer insight into who may be protected against re-infection. In a series of tweets announcing the new authorizations, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said: \u201cSerology tests can play a critical role in fighting #COVID19 by helping health care professionals identify people who may have overcome #COVID19 & developed an immune response.\u201d The new tests come from Chembio Diagnostic Systems and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, and they join a test authorized in early April from the company Cellex. The nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, hinted at the new authorizations last week. \"Within a period of a week or so, we're going to have a rather large number of tests that are available,\" he said on CNN's New Day Friday morning. ##Health## Germany will start to relax nationwide Covid-19 restrictions next week on some shops, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday. The shops, which must meet certain size requirements, will be allowed to reopen if hygiene plans are followed, Merkel said Wednesday. Schools will gradually reopen on May 4\u00a0with priority given to primary and secondary students in their final years.  At the same time, the country is extending its ''contact ban'' in the fight against coronavirus until May 3, Merkel said. Germany's contact ban rules that no more than two people can meet in public, unless people live in the same household.  Large public events are banned until the end of August to prevent mass transmission of the virus.  ''Any further relaxation of lockdown will depend on how infection rate develops \u2014 we have little room to maneuver,\" Merkel said. She went on to say that face masks should be worn in shops and public transport. ##Daily Life## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he is issuing an executive order that all people in the state must wear a mask or mouth and nose covering in public, whenever they are in a situation where they cannot maintain social distancing of 6 feet or less. \u201cIf you're going to get on\u00a0public transit, you're going to\u00a0get on a bus, you're going to\u00a0get on a subway, you're going to\u00a0stand on a subway platform,\u00a0you're going to walk in a\u00a0neighborhood that is busy,\u00a0you're going to be on a\u00a0sidewalk, you're going to pass\u00a0other people on a sidewalk,\u00a0you're not going to be able to\u00a0maintain social distancing, you\u00a0must wear a mask,\u201d Cuomo said.\u00a0 There will be a three-day notice period before the order is enforced, allowing New Yorkers to secure masks or face coverings, Cuomo announced Wednesday afternoon. Local governments should start to enforce it, but there won't be any penalties as of right now, he added. Watch: ##Daily Life## ##Health## \u00a0 New York will send 100 ventilators to Michigan and 50 to Maryland in an effort to mitigate death rates there, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. \u201cI will never forget the generosity people across the country showed our state,\u201d he said. Now that its health care situation has stabilized, New York is returning the favor to neighboring states. A critical piece of personal protective equipment, the N95 respirator, can be safety cleaned and re-used, according to a study published Wednesday by scientists at the National Institutes of Health. The respirators are designed for single-use, but according to the NIH study, they could potentially be used up to three times if they\u2019re properly decontaminated in between uses.\u00a0 The study has not been peer-reviewed, but was published on a pre-print server designed to expedite the release of research. In a statement, NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that a variety of cleaning methods \u2013 such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide, dry heat, ultraviolet light or ethanol spray \u2013\u00a0could successfully decontaminate the respirators. Some of these methods caused problems with the fit and seal of the masks, but one technique \u2013 vaporized hydrogen peroxide \u2013\u00a0did not result in failures. Masks undergoing that treatment, then, could be re-used three times, NIH said.\u00a0 The US Food and Drug Administration has now authorized three respirator decontamination systems for use during the coronavirus pandemic, all of which rely on hydrogen peroxide decontamination. \u00a0##Health## Dr. Anthony Fauci,\u00a0the country's top medical expert on the coronavirus pandemic and a member of President Trump's coronavirus task force,\u00a0said there is a way for sports to return. He suggested no fans and weekly testing.

Put [the players] in big hotels, wherever you want to play, keep them very well surveilled ... and have them tested every single week and make sure they don't wind up infecting each other or their family, and just let them play the season out.\" \"People say you can't play without spectators. Well, I think you will probably get enough buy in if from people who are dying to see a baseball game, particularly me. I'm living in Washington.

Little, speaking at a virtual press conference, said Idaho has at least 1,464 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and 39 deaths.\u00a0\u00a0 He went on to say that since the stay-at-home order was issued, the state has been \"flattening the curve.\"  ##Daily Life## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, speaking at his daily briefing, said all states are having a hard time bringing coronavirus testing to scale quickly,  \"Every governor is now in the same situation,\" he said, citing conversations with his counterparts across the country. The states need assistance from the federal government to bring testing to scale, he said, adding \u201cthe more testing, the more opening of the economy.\u201d States need help with testing and tracing, as well as funding from the federal government, Cuomo said. Watch:  ##Health## Members of the World Health Organization on Wednesday defended their early actions when it came to fighting the coronavirus. Dr. Mike Ryan,\u00a0executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies program said, \u201cwhen WHO issued its first guidance to countries, it was extremely clear that respiratory precautions should be taken in dealing with patients with this disease, that labs needed to be careful in terms of their precautions and taking samples, because there was a risk that the disease could spread from person to person in those environments.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Dr.\u00a0Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious diseases epidemiologist with WHO, said she recently went back and listened to the WHO news conference on January 14, and at the time, there were 41 confirmed cases worldwide.\u00a0 \u201cAll of our guidance that was before we did that press conference was about limiting exposure to people and to prevent transmission, particularly in health care settings,\u201d adding \u201cour guidance that was put out was about respiratory droplets and contact protection,\u201d Van Kerkove said.\u00a0Noting, that was out on January 10 and 11. Ryan said health systems around the world, including the United States, began to activate incident management systems during the first week of January.\u00a0 \u201cIn the initial reports, in which there were no mention of human to human transmission, was a cluster of atypical pneumonia or pneumonia or unknown origin,\" he said. \u201cThe idea of having a defense, at this point, seems rather strange,\u201d\u00a0Ryan said.\u00a0 Ryan went on to say that \u201cthere are literally millions and millions of cases of atypical pneumonia around the world, every year,\u201d adding, in the middle of flu season, \u201csometimes it's very difficult to pick out a signal of a cluster of cases. In fact, it's quite remarkable that such a cluster was picked out \u2014 41 confirmed cases ultimately in a cluster in Wuhan.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe will be very happy when the after action reviews come in fact, I am very anxious for those after action reviews to come because we do them for every outbreak response and I'll be delighted with our teams and look forward to that engagement to look and see where we can learn to do better, where we can improve our response,\" Ryan said. ##Health## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that the state's Health Department has developed its own coronavirus antibody test. \"New York state Department of Health developed their own\u00a0antibody tests, and that test is\u00a0going to be very important, and\u00a0it's in our control, because\u00a0we'd actually do those tests.\u00a0We don't need a private lab.\u00a0We don't need anybody else.\u00a0With those tests, it will go to\u00a0about 2,000-per-day capacity,\u00a0and that is a finger prick test,\u00a0so it's not terribly invasive,\" Cuomo said today during a news conference. Cuomo added that the state is pursuing Food and Drug Administration approval that \"could get us to\u00a0100,000 people per day.\u00a0To give you an idea, that's then\u00a0500,000 a week.\" Some context: Antibody tests \u2014 also known as serology tests \u2014 aren't meant to diagnose active coronavirus infections. Rather, they check for proteins in the immune system, known as antibodies, through a blood sample.  Their presence means a person was exposed to the virus and developed antibodies against it, which may mean that person has at least some immunity \u2014 although experts are not sure how strong the immunity may be or even how long it will last. Watch: ##Health## More than 9,200 health care workers have been infected with Covid-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in its first such assessment, published on Tuesday. The number is likely an underestimate, since most reports of coronavirus cases don\u2019t note whether the person worked in health care. \u201cThis national surveillance article spotlights the large number of health care personnel already infected with Covid-19,\u201d CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat told CNN. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all learned this virus was a greater threat than we had thought.\u201d Among the health care workers who had coronavirus, 90% were not hospitalized.

The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, adds to a growing body of evidence showing that seemingly-healthy people are spreading the virus. \u201cWe observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset,\u201d the researchers wrote.\u00a0 They found that viral shedding \u2013 when people may be able to infect others \u2013\u00a0could begin two to three days before symptoms appeared. The amount of virus given off, though, appeared to decline after people began feeling sick. Researchers warned that people may be spreading the virus before they show symptoms, public health interventions \u2013 such as contact tracing \u2013 will need to be adjusted.\u00a0 Not only will investigators need to identify those who were exposed to symptomatic people, but they may also need to look retroactively \u2013 tracing contacts from when people still felt healthy. \u201cMore inclusive criteria for contact tracing to capture potential transmission events 2 to 3 days before symptom onset should be urgently considered for effective control of the outbreak,\u201d the researchers wrote. More details: The study did have limitations. Namely, it relied on patients\u2019 memories of when their symptoms first appeared, which could have been fuzzy. Still, the research is consistent with other findings, which suggest that people who don\u2019t feel sick are in fact contributing to the spread of the virus. Based on that growing body of evidence, the White House has recommended that healthy people wear face coverings outside to reduce the risk of infecting others. \u00a0##Health## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $170 million initiative to battle food insecurity, an existing problem in the city amplified by economic woes due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cPeople are literally asking 'where's my next meal coming from?'

The procedures are to last for one year, the statement said. \u201cWe support a time-bound suspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries that request forbearance,\u201d a statement by the group read.  Following a virtual meeting by the G20 Finance Ministers, Saudi Minister of Finance Mohammed Al Jadaan said that debt-suspension has been agreed on by G20 countries unanimously with the aim of giving developing countries \"breathing space\" due to the pandemic.  The debt-suspension only requires countries to work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and will provide more than $20 billion of immediate liquidity, Al Jadaan said.  G20 countries have injected $7 trillion into the global economy, Al Jadaan added. \u201cWe support the further adoption and swift implementation of a strong financial response to help countries in need and to uphold global financial stability and resilience,\u201d the G20 said in a statement.\u00a0 Amnesty International, a global human rights group, called on the US Congress to stop President Trump\u2019s plan to halt funding to the World Health Organization amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe U.S. administration should immediately reconsider its suspension of funding. Congress should also take immediate action to halt any measures which reverse the US\u2019s longstanding commitment to protecting international public health,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, in a statement on Wednesday. Trump on Tuesday announced he was halting funding to WHO while a review is conducted over the agency\u2019s \u201crole in severely mismanaging and covering up the\u00a0spread of coronavirus.\u201d\u00a0 Guevara-Rosas said this decision distracts \"from criticisms of his own administration's response\" and undermines \"global efforts to protect people from one of the worst health crises in over a century.\u201d The novel coronavirus does not respect borders, she added, and \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s proposal to slash [WHO\u2019s] resources at this moment of crisis will undermine efforts to save lives and halt the spread of the virus.\u201d Abbott Laboratories announced the\u00a0release of\u00a0an\u00a0antibody test Wednesday that could detect if people have been infected with the novel coronavirus\u00a0and recovered. The test could help individuals determine if they had Covid-19\u00a0in the past, and could more broadly help determine how widespread the infection is in the United States. While the test has not been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, Abbott is legally allowed to distribute it under regulatory flexibilities issued by the agency. Abbott, which\u00a0said it is\u00a0shipping 1 million of the tests to customers immediately, plans to produce and ship up to 20 million tests by the end of June. The specifics: In a press release, Abbott claimed its SARS-CoV-2\u00a0(novel coronavirus)\u00a0IgG test identifies the IgG antibody, which is a protein that the body produces in the late stages of infection and may remain for months and possibly years after a person has recovered. That\u2019s in contrast to the Cellex antibody test that has been authorized by the FDA; that test can\u00a0also\u00a0detect another class of antibodies called IgM antibodies, which are present earlier in infection.\u00a0 Still, all antibody tests may miss some recent infections, since antibodies are our body\u2019s response to an infection \u2013 which can take time.\u00a0 Abbott's IgG antibody test will initially be available on its ARCHITECT\u00a0i1000SR and\u00a0i2000SR laboratory instruments. More than 2,000 of these instruments are in use in US laboratories. These instruments can run up to 100-200 tests per hour, according to the company.\u00a0 Abbott is making the test available as part of the FDA notification without an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway outlined in Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019 during the Public Health Emergency. But the company says it plans to file for emergency use authorization with the FDA. The World Health Organization \"is getting on with the job\" to respond to the coronavirus pandemic in wake of\u00a0President Trump's announcement to withhold funding, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing on Wednesday. \"WHO is grateful to the many nations, organizations and individuals who have expressed their support and commitment to WHO in recent days, including their financial commitment,\" Tedros said.\u00a0\"We welcome this demonstration of global solidarity\u00a0because solidarity is the rule of the game to defeat Covid-19. WHO is getting on with the job. We\u2019re continuing to study this virus every moment of every day, we are learning from many countries about what works and we are sharing that information with the world.\" WHO is assessing exactly how its programs will be affected by the loss of funding from the United States,\u00a0Tedros said. \"We will do the assessment and then announce it officially,\" Tedros said during the briefing. \"We will continue to work with every country and every partner to serve the people of the world, with a relentless commitment to science, solutions and solidarity,\" Tedros added.\u00a0\"WHO has been fighting the pandemic with every ounce of our soul and spirit. We will continue to do that until the end.\" Some context: Trump\u00a0announced Tuesday that he is halting funding to the\u00a0WHO\u00a0while a review is conducted. Trump said the review would cover the WHO's \"role in severely mismanaging and covering up the\u00a0spread of coronavirus.\" Trump's announcement comes in the middle of the worst global\u00a0pandemic\u00a0in decades. Award-winning actress Taraji P. Henson is offering up to five free therapy sessions for minority communities reeling from the coronavirus pandemic through her mental health foundation.\u00a0 \u201cNo one should be\u00a0suffering right now in silence.\u00a0That breaks my heart to know\u00a0that so many people are.\u00a0And you should not be afraid to\u00a0talk about your mental health.\u00a0And you shouldn't have to choose\u00a0between a meal and your mental\u00a0health,\u201d she told CNN today.\u00a0\u201cThese\u00a0scars will last forever.\u00a0They won't go away.\u00a0People will be traumatized\u00a0forever.\u00a0Families will be destroyed and\u00a0ripped apart.\" Henson said the racial disparity of coronavirus cases is \u201calarming.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI had to do something. \u2026 It is hard enough and most\u00a0difficult for the black\u00a0community to even speak up about\u00a0mental illnesses or mental\u00a0health because of the stigma\u00a0around it in the community.\u00a0So I felt like I had to do\u00a0something in this moment in time\u00a0to relieve the stress, the\u00a0anxiety, to save some lives,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Henson encouraged people to use their time at home during the coronavirus to assess their mental health and take action.\u00a0Henson has said she suffers from depression and anxiety and launched a foundation named after her father, a Vietnam veteran. The director of the World Health Organization responded to President Trump's decision to withhold funding to his organization\u00a0 \u201cThe United States of America has been a long-standing and generous friend of WHO and we hope it will continue to be so,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday in Geneva. Tedros said WHO is reviewing the impact any withdrawal of US funding will have, and that the organization will work to fill any financial gaps it faces to ensure its work continues uninterrupted. Tedros added WHO works to improve the\u00a0health of world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable and doesn\u2019t only fight coronavirus.\u00a0 Gov. Ralph Northam is calling on both medical and non-medical volunteers to join the fight against Covid-19 in his state, according to a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0 Northam announced a statewide effort in collaboration with the\u00a0Virginia Department of Health\u2019s Virginia Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) to recruit \"up to 30,000 volunteers\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to provide support for the expected surge in hospitals and long-term care facilities throughout the Commonwealth.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Northam says the effort will focus on university students, particularly those studying health or medicine, and individuals who have recently filed for unemployment but have \"relevant experience,\" the statement said.\u00a0\u00a0 Nearly a third of the 14,700 people who have signed up to volunteer with the MRC have done so in the last few weeks, and half of those have medical experience, the statement said.\u00a0\u00a0 The statement expressed a need for nurses, nurse practitioners and nursing students but said\u00a0the\u00a0state would be offering training for non-medical professionals as well.\u00a0\u00a0 The Spanish government will distribute more than 2 million masks to workers in the transportation industry, the Ministry for Transport said in a statement.  With this new shipment, the government will have distributed 3.3 million masks for workers in this area. \"With this we are doubling the distribution of masks and, particularly in the case of public bus transport, we are quadruplicating it. As such, we are now distributing a total of 2,250,644 masks among workers in the transport sector,\" the statement says.\u00a0 The government said the transport sector is doing \"an essential service,\" including the public transport of goods, bus travel, taxi services and rail travel, as well as the \"private transport\" of supplies.\u00a0 3M, the largest maker of N95 face masks in the country, has sued a Florida company for allegedly twice offering to sell tens of millions of 3M N95 respirators to the federal Division of Strategic National Stockpile at inflated prices.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3M also says the company, Orlando-based Geftico LLC, falsely claimed to be associated with 3M as a distributor and that the masks in question were \u201clikely nonexistent.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CNN has made multiple attempts to reach the president of Geftico and the law firm listed on the Florida Division of Corporations website as the company\u2019s registered agent for comment,\u00a0but has not received a response.\u00a0 The lawsuit alleges that at different times,\u00a0Geftico offered to sell a specific model of 3M N95 masks for $6.77 per respirator, over\u00a0four\u00a0times more than 3M\u2019s suggested list price of $1.27 per respirator and for $3.60 per respirator, still\u00a0nearly three times\u00a0the suggested price.\u00a0\u00a0 3M is seeking injunctive relief to require Geftico to cease trying to sell masks and also requests damages, according to the complaint.\u00a0 If the company wins damages in the lawsuit, 3M said it will donate the money to charities working on Covid-19 relief, according to the complaint.\u00a0 Some context: Amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, N95 respirators and other personal protective equipment are in high demand for medical personnel.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The lawsuit is the latest in a series of lawsuits 3M has filed recently alleging companies have price gouged and counterfeited their products.\u00a0 Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Wednesday morning the extension of the District\u2019s public health emergency until May 15.  Bowser says the Washington, DC, government will provide more details on the future of schools and government employees on April 17. The deputy attorney general told Justice Department employees to wear face coverings in common areas at agency buildings in a memo to staff on Tuesday. The memo follows and notes country-wide guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that face coverings should be worn in public settings. The guidance also comes as many Justice Department employees continue to stay out of the office and work from home.\u00a0 Employees who work out of a government building are told they may remove the covering in a private office, cubicle or workspace where at least six feet of social distancing can be maintained from others.\u00a0 Some context: Attorney General William Barr has referred to some social distancing policies as \"draconian\" and called for steps towards normalcy to resume after the end of the month, but he's also acknowledged the administration's stay at home directives were necessary to combat the virus.\u00a0 More recently, Barr softened his tone and expressed support for the federal guidelines.\u00a0 For his part, Barr frequently\u00a0wears a mask around the Justice Department as he continues to report to work during the pandemic, he told Fox News in an interview last week. He also wears one along with his security detail when he commutes into Washington every morning, he said.\u00a0 There are 2,156 New York City Police Department officers who have tested positive for coronavirus, a source with knowledge confirmed to CNN. In total, there are 6,274 NYPD officers currently out sick which represents 17.4% of the force. Since March 12, 3,350 officers tested positive for the virus. Roughly 1,184 police officers have recovered from Covid-19 and have returned to work. More than 100 countries have already asked for emergency assistance from the International Monetary Fund amid the economic fallout from coronavirus.\u00a0 Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors that 10 countries have so far received their requested emergency funding, and the IMF will approve funding for half of the remaining countries by the end of April. The IMF told the G20 finance leaders that it is \u201curgently seeking\u201d $18 billion in new loan resources for its Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, and says it will likely need at least $1.8 billion in new subsidy resources. Georgieva warned that they \u201cwill need to step up even more\u201d in the months and years ahead. She said the IMF is ready to use its \u201cfull toolbox and $1 trillion firepower\u201d through a deep recession in 2020 and only a partial recovery in 2021. ##Business## While delays in testing \u2013 and shortages of testing supplies \u2013 have been reported across the country, it\u2019s also possible that a slowdown in the pandemic is responsible for the reported decline in tests. Currently in the United States, testing is primarily done on those who are symptomatic. While the US is still seeing an increasing number of cases, social distancing measures do seem to be working, limiting transmission of the virus. Assuming there are enough tests available, that slowdown could explain why fewer people are needing tests at hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices and other sites. Or, doctors may just be ordering fewer tests, perhaps reserving them for only the sickest patients. If there isn\u2019t widespread availability of testing, though, then the reported decline in cases may be misleading. In a statement on Wednesday, the American Clinical Laboratory Association \u2013 which represents commercial labs such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics \u2013 said that testing capacity was not an issue. \u201cACLA members have now eliminated testing backlogs, and have considerable capacity that is not being used,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe stand ready to perform more testing and are in close communication with public health partners about ways we can support additional needs.\u201d Some context: Other groups, though, have reported problems. In a Monday\u00a0letter\u00a0to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Association of American Medical Colleges said labs are facing critical shortages. \u201cWidespread but uneven shortages in one or more of the essential components for testing have resulted in a situation where few labs are able to maximize the testing capacity of any one machine, platform, or test,\u201d the group said. It added that \u201claboratories across the country are working day and night to expand testing capacity but are severely hampered by shortages of needed reagents, swabs for testing, PPE, and specialized equipment designed by companies to be used with their own machines.\u201d ##Health## A federal judge has postponed the criminal trial of associates of Rudy Giuliani until February 1, granting a four-month delay over coronavirus concerns. Prosecutors asked the federal judge Tuesday to postpone the trial of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman\u00a0amid the coronavirus pandemic \u201cgiven the considerable uncertainty surrounding any timeline for a relaxation or removal of those restrictions.\u201d  They noted they\u00a0didn\u2019t object to a request by lawyers for the defendants who sought to postpone the trial because of their difficulty of meeting with their clients, who are based in Florida and California, and prepare for trial.\u00a0 Some context: Parnas, Fruman\u00a0and two other men were charged in a campaign finance scheme. They have pleaded not guilty. The men were schedule to go to trial on October 5, about one month before the presidential election. Parnas and Fruman were central players in Giuliani\u2019s effort to dig up dirt on Joseph and Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in the Ukraine. The coronavirus pandemic has grinded the criminal justice system to a halt across the country with grand juries disrupted and criminal and civil trials postponed. In the Southern District of New York trials are postponed until at least June 1.\u00a0 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide surpassed 2 million on Wednesday, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.  Covid-19 has infected 2,000,984 and killed at least 128,071 people globally.  The United States leads with the most deaths and the most confirmed cases worldwide. There are at least\u00a0609,696\u00a0confirmed coronavirus cases and at least\u00a026,059 deaths from the disease. A vaccine for coronavirus may be ready for use by emergency workers sometime this autumn, according to Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, the National Institute of Health\u2019s lead scientist for coronavirus vaccine research. Corbett said that the vaccine could be ready for use by front-line health care workers as soon as this fall and for the global population by next spring.\u00a0Her team is currently testing the safety of the vaccine in the first phase, and then will test its effectiveness in subsequent phases.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re targeting fall for the\u00a0emergency use.\u00a0\u2026 And then for the general\u00a0population, our target goal is\u00a0for next spring \u2014 and that is, if\u00a0all things go well and if these\u00a0phase one, phase two and phase\u00a0three clinical trials work simultaneously for the good, our plan is to have people vaccinated\u00a0all over the world by next spring,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Vaccine development is typically a long process, and Corbett said that her team has actually been working on a coronavirus vaccine for years already.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve researched\u00a0coronavirus vaccine development\u00a0for the last 7 years \u2014 particularly under my direction,\u00a0the team has researched this\u00a0coronavirus development for 5\u00a0years. And so coming into the\u00a0onset of this pandemic, we had\u00a0an idea about what we wanted to\u00a0do as far as the design of the\u00a0vaccine,\u201d Corbett said. Watch the interview: The French government announced it will pay health workers a bonus of up to 1500 euros, roughly $1,634, for treating Covid-19 patients. Hospital staff will receive 500 euros\u00a0(US$ 544) and those working directly in coronavirus impacted areas will get 1,500 euros (US$ 1,634), French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Wednesday following a cabinet meeting. Medical staff working overtime will be compensated an extra 50% on top of their already elevated overtime pay. Philippe said French President Emmanuel Macron wanted to give a bonus to nursing home staff and those managing Covid-19 patients confined at home.  The French state will also pay civil servants a bonus of up to 1,000 euros (US$ 1,087). France regrets President Trump\u2019s decision to cut funding for the\u00a0World Health Organization, French government spokesperson Sibeth Ndiaye said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a situation that we obviously regret, given France and the President\u2019s attachment to multilateralism,\u201d Ndiaye explained. The government \u201cdeplores each time that a dent is put in multilateralism,\u201d the spokesperson added. France \u201chopes for a quick return to normal, and for the WHO to be able to carry out its work serenely,\u201d Ndiaye concluded. ##Health## \u00a0 The daily number of Covid-19 tests performed by commercial labs has appeared to slightly decline in the past week, according to a CNN analysis of data from the American Clinical Laboratory Association.\u00a0 Members of the ACLA include LabCorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories and Quest Diagnostics, among other commonly used labs. In the past seven days, between April 7 and 14, there were about 576,000 newly completed tests reported by ACLA member labs.\u00a0In the seven-day period before that, between March 31 and April 7, there were about 673,000 newly completed tests reported by ACLA member labs. Those numbers represent an approximate 14% decrease in the newly completed tests performed by ACLA member labs. What does this mean: It remains unclear what could be fueling the recent slowdown of completed commercial lab tests. For instance, some labs may have struggled to meet the demand of testing services and now face backlogs.  Among other possible factors, there could have been a delay in reporting, or the decline could be tied to stronger efforts to prioritize testing certain at-risk patients per updated guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For now, this recent decline in newly completed tests from commercial labs comes at a time when the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths overall continue to rise in the United States. On Wednesday, the nation recorded its highest number of coronavirus deaths in a single day after several days in which the death toll had fallen or was nearly flat.\u00a0 ##Health##\u00a0 US stocks fell at Wednesday\u2019s open on worsening economic data and falling oil prices. US retail sales dropped 8.7% in March, their worst decline on record, and the New York Fed\u2019s manufacturing index collapsed to its worst level in history.\u00a0 China stepped in to support its financial sector, suggesting things could be worse than anticipated in the world\u2019s second largest economy. The Dow opened 2.3%, or 565 points, lower. The S&P 500 kicked off 2.3% lower. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.8% at the open. Canada\u2019s GDP fell approximately 9% in March, according to Statistics Canada, the national statistical office that provides key information on the economy, society and environment, published Tuesday morning. The \u201cflash estimate\u201d was published \u201cgiven the unique situation faced by the Canadian economy in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and the demand for trusted information on the aggregate impact of this health crisis on the economy,\u201d Statistics Canada said. Statistics Canada added: \u201cEven though the basis of calculation is different, in a relative sense, this would be the largest one-month decline in\u00a0GDP, since the series started in\u00a01961. Overall for the quarter, this flash estimate of\u00a0GDP\u00a0leads to an approximate decline of\u00a02.6% for the first quarter of\u00a02020.\u201d ##Business## New York's manufacturers don't see a light at the end of the tunnel yet. The New York Federal Reserve's index that measures general businesses conditions plummeted 57 points to -78.2 in April. That's the lowest level on record in the history of the Empire State Manufacturing Survey. The coronavirus crisis is weighing on both demand and supply chains in manufacturing. The damage is broad-based, with the survey revealing worsening conditions on every front: business activity, new orders and shipments declined. Delivery times have also expanded and inventories have fallen. There's a thin silver lining: Survey respondents expect conditions to be slightly better six months from now. ##Business## Connie Titchen, a 106-year-old great-grandmother in the United Kingdom, has been released from the hospital three weeks after testing positive for coronavirus. \u201cShe is our oldest patient to beat the virus - and may well be the oldest in the country to do so,\u201d the Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust said Wednesday. Nurses at Birmingham City Hospital lined the corridor to applaud the great-grandmother of eight as she was wheeled out to be sent home. \u201cI feel very lucky that I\u2019ve fought off this virus. I can\u2019t wait to see my family,\u201d Titchen said, according to a statement from the NHS Trust. The hospital says Titchen, who was born in September 1913 and has lived through two World Wars, was admitted to City Hospital in mid-March with suspected pneumonia. She was diagnosed with coronavirus soon afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic to see Connie recover.\u00a0She is amazing and we\u2019ve been doing our best to nurse her back to health. We were really pleased when she was given the all clear. It\u2019s nice to see patients leave our ward after having beaten this virus,\" nurse Kelly Smith said.  ##Health## Amazon says it may suspend all of its distribution activity in France after a court ruled Tuesday it had to stop all non-essential activities due to the coronavirus outbreak. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it is \u201cperplexed\u201d by the court ruling.  \u201cOur interpretation of the ruling suggests we might have to suspend the activities of our in-country fulfillment network in France. We\u2019re working rapidly to understand the judgement and evaluate our options, and we expect to appeal,\u201d Amazon said in the statement.  The online retail giant went on to say it has already implemented safety measures including \u201ctemperature checks, masks, and enforced social distancing which have received the approval of health and safety representatives at multiple sites.\u201d Some context: On Tuesday a French court ordered Amazon to reduce its local delivery operations to only essential goods, or the company could face a penalty of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for each day of delay. The court has also required that the company carry out an assessment of the \"occupational risks inherent in the Covid-19 epidemic\" in all of its warehouses. ##Business## American Medical Association President Dr. Patrice Harris said now is not the time to cut funding to the World Health Organization, after President Trump\u00a0announced Tuesday he is halting funding to the\u00a0organization\u00a0while a review is conducted. \u201cDuring the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the WHO is a dangerous step in the wrong direction. Others, many others, have said this virus knows no boundaries, this is a global pandemic, it certainly requires global cooperation.\u00a0Infections in other parts of the world could certainly impact us here in the United States,\u201d Harris said.\u00a0 Some context: The US sends $400 million to $500 million to the WHO each year, Trump said.\u00a0 Harris added that \u201cclear and consistent messaging\u201d is key during any health crisis.\u00a0 \u201cThe public needs to trust that\u00a0their leaders are being honest\u00a0and forthcoming and are really\u00a0working cooperatively to do\u00a0whatever they can,\u201d she said. \u201cPhysicians feel like we're going\u00a0into this with one arm tied\u00a0behind our back.\u00a0And so we really need the\u00a0administration to use all the\u00a0levers of the government to get\u00a0those on the front lines all the\u00a0support they need.\" Watch Harris' remarks: Switzerland\u00a0faces shortages of medicine for coronavirus patients in intensive care unit, the country's health ministry admitted Tuesday, calling the situation ''tense.'' Patrick Mathys, the head of the Swiss federal health ministry resolution team,\u00a0told reporters in a press conference ''there are real bottlenecks for essential medicines in intensive care''\u00a0adding that ''there has been some easing of the situation, but in the long term it's a huge problem.\"\u00a0 Mathys went on to say that the country competes with the international market to purchase more drugs and that the procurement\u00a0of medicine is equally as challenging as procuring protective masks.  ''We need to procure these (intensive care medicine)\u00a0as much as we can on the international market but you can imagine that as with protective masks, these drugs are also in demand again worldwide. The situation is tense,'' he said. Switzerland's death toll from coronavirus stands at 973 on Wednesday, according to figures from the Federal Office for Public Health. In addition, the number of infected cases has risen to 26,336-- an increase of 502 cases within the last 24 hours.\u00a0\u00a0 The country\u2019s Federal Council, which extended lockdown measures until April 26, said it would convene on Thursday to discuss easing of restrictions and observe developments in neighboring countries like Austria,\u00a0which began to\u00a0allow partial returns to work\u00a0after Easter. \u00a0##Health## It has been a year since a fire\u00a0devastated\u00a0the Notre Dame cathedral, causing its spire to collapse and leaving the 850-year-old church's future in doubt. The blaze, which French\u00a0prosecutors say\u00a0may have been started by a cigarette or electrical malfunction, elicited solidarity and donations from around the world last April.  But with the coronavirus shutdown bringing restoration efforts to a standstill \u2014 and the country's attention now focused elsewhere \u2014 the somber anniversary is set to pass with little fanfare. Work at the Paris site has been suspended since March 16, when France\u00a0introduced widespread measures\u00a0to help control the spread of Covid-19. And despite the months of recovery work already undertaken, there is ongoing uncertainty about the full extent of the damage. Some context: Dismantling of the scaffolding was due to be completed in June, though France's Ministry of Culture has not yet responded to CNN's requests about how the suspension of work may impact the restoration timeline \u2014 or how realistic Macron's initial plans to reopen the landmark by 2024 remain.  The French president's priorities lie elsewhere, and on Monday evening he used a televised address to\u00a0announce\u00a0that the nationwide shutdown would continue for another month. Read the full story here. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working hard to make sure testing, contact tracing and an expanded public health capacity is in place as the country begins talking about opening back up, director Dr. Robert Redfield said this morning on CBS. \u201cIt's going to be really important to get a few things in place: more obviously testing for early diagnostics, expand the public health capacity for early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing. This is going to be fundamental to maintain and contain cases as they occur. And then make sure we have the health capacity to deal with this, as we work to regain the confidence of the American public that it's safe to go back to work,\" Redfield said. Asked about the study saying Americans may need to social distance until 2022, Redfield said, \u201cI think the mitigation steps that we\u2019ve done are going to be an important component of it. I think it's really, really a moment to take a bow for the American public that really embraced the social distancing recommendations that we put forward.\u201d Redfield added: \u201cIt really is the American public's response to social distance and sacrifice, not for themselves but for the benefit of the most vulnerable. It's really a testament. I do think we're going to have some social distancing that's going to be a critical part of our strategy as we go forward while we await the fruits of the innovation of the different biological countermeasures to include a vaccine.\" The United Kingdom believes the World Health Organization (WHO) has an \u201cimportant role\u201d to play in leading the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said, adding there are no plans to withdraw funding. The comments put the UK at odds with President Trump, who has criticized the WHO\u2019s response and announced a suspension of funding. \u00a0\u201cOur position is the UK has no plans to stop funding the WHO which has an important role to play in leading the global health response,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said Wednesday. \u00a0\u201cCoronavirus is a global challenge and it is essential countries work together to tackle this shared threat, the spokesperson added. \u201cIn terms of how we contribute to the WHO, that is an assessment of the WHO\u2019s needs and is not based on other country\u2019s funding.\u201d Some context: Earlier this week, the UK announced it would boost its contribution to the WHO by \u00a365 million ($81 million). The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is filling in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will participate in a G7 leaders conference call on Thursday. According to the prime minister's spokesperson, Raab will underline the need for \u201cglobal collaboration\u201d to deal with the crisis, including the speed and scale of a vaccine and testing internationally. \u201cWe will also discuss economic concerns and how to support struggling nations,\u201d the spokesperson said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an interview Wednesday that the US is seeing a flattening out of new coronavirus cases. Except for a few cities where\u00a0cases haven't peaked yet, \"there's no doubt what we've seen over the last several days is a flattening out,\" Fauci said. \"Even when you get to New York, it's actually starting to come down regarding admissions, hospitalizations, needs for intensive care and intubation,\" Fauci told NBC. \"Hopefully that trend will continue. \u2026 As I say, I'm a very cautious person, but we are seeing some light at the end of the tunnel,\" Fauci added. ##Health## Finland will lift restrictions on movement in its capital Helsinki and the surrounding region,\u00a0Uusimaa, later on Wednesday, the government has announced. The government said the legal grounds for continuing to restrict movement \"are no longer considered to exist.\" \"When the travel restrictions entered into force on 28 March, Covid-19 incidence in the region of Uusimaa was increasing significantly faster than in the rest of the country,\" the government said. \"While Uusimaa still has the highest number of Covid-19 cases, the gap with the rest of the country has narrowed.\u201d Despite the plan to lift movement restrictions, the Finnish government is still advising against all unnecessary travel.  Some context: Last week, the Finnish government announced that\u00a0that restrictions on schools, museums, theaters enacted on March 16 would remain in place until May 13. Finland has recorded 3,161 cases of coronavirus, and 64 deaths, according to the\u00a0Finnish\u00a0Institute for Health and Welfare. \u00a0 ##Daily Life## Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says experts \"don't have all the answers\" when it comes to antibodies. In an interview on the \"Today\" show, Fauci was asked to comment on a report out of South Korea's CDC that found coronavirus had been reactivated in a number of patients thought to have recovered. \"We don't know how common that is,\" Fauci said. \"It's likely an uncommon event and won't have a public health impact.\" \"The things that we don't know is that -- in general with viruses we deal with all the time -- when you develop an antibody after infection, it almost invariably means you're protected. We don't absolutely know that for sure yet,\" Fauci said. He added there is also uncertainty about how long antibodies can protect a person. \"So are you protected for a month or two or three, a half a year or a year? We need to get experience to know that,\" Fauci said. ##Health## Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday that \"there is going to be a great deal of variability\" when thinking about relaxing\u00a0social distancing guidelines. Fauci was asked about President Trump's remarks about the possibility that some states could lift stay-at-home orders before May 1. \"I'm certain, though even though I haven't discussed this with him, that he's talking about some of the states that have a very low level now, particularly those states with a low density of population and a lot of geographic lands,\" Fauci told NBC. Fauci added that some states will do \"nothing different because they are still in a really difficult situation, and you would not want to relax any of the physical separation guidelines, and others that would be doing really much better. So It's not going to be a one-size-fits-all.\" ##Health## New York City Bill de Blasio said social distancing restrictions are still necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus in the city and that everyday New Yorkers are key to making sure the virus doesn\u2019t accelerate again.\u00a0 \u201cOne false move,\u00a0take our foot off the gas, we will\u00a0regret it.\u00a0We've got one chance \u2026 to contain this thing and\u00a0then we can do a proper smart\u00a0restart, and we do it too soon, I\u00a0guarantee we'll regret it,\u201d he told CNN. De Blasio also said that the federal government has still not provided enough testing kits.  \u201cWe're creating our own tests\u00a0here in New York City.\u00a0We just couldn't wait any\u00a0longer,\" the mayor said. De Blasio said \u201cthe next phase\u201d of coronavirus is months away.\u00a0 \u201cTo get to the next phase\u00a0literally means getting to the\u00a0point where we know each\u00a0individual person who has\u00a0contracted the coronavirus,\u00a0we're tracing all of their\u00a0contacts, we\u2019re doing isolation and quarantine\u00a0for anyone who needs, we\u2019re testing\u00a0all the time,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Some context: The New York City Health Department is now reporting more than 3,700 \u201cprobable\u201d Covid-19 deaths of individuals who have not been tested for the coronavirus but are presumed to be positive. \u201cWe've all\u00a0gone through hell here,\u201d de Blasio said. \"We should be honest about the\u00a0full extent of this.\u00a0And that bluntly, should inspire us\u00a0to really get it right. This disease is ferocious.\u201d\u00a0 De Blasio also called for more help from the federal government for the country\u2019s biggest city and encouraged Congress to pass another stimulus package.\u00a0 \u201cWe're one of the economic\u00a0engines of the country.\u00a0We're not going to be able to\u00a0provide basic services and have\u00a0a normal society if we don't get\u00a0help from the federal\u00a0government,\u201d he said. Watch de Blasio's comments: CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the World Health Organization \"has been a long-term and still is a great partner for us,\" despite President Trump cutting its funding Tuesday. Here's what Redfield told CBS today: \"Those decisions that are made above related to some of the geopolitical issues, I have to leave to those that really have that expertise. But, for me and for CDC and the public health arena, we're continuing to work side by side with WHO to do the best that we can to limit the spread of disease and to protect the American people.\" \u00a0Redfield added that, \"It's important at this point that we leave the analysis of what could have been done better and what maybe we did well to once we get through this and get through the outbreak, we get it over.\" ##Health## More\u00a0than\u00a0400,000 people\u00a0could\u00a0die of Covid-19 in\u00a0Japan\u00a0if\u00a0nothing\u00a0is\u00a0done\u00a0to contain the virus, according to a report released Wednesday by the Japanese Health Ministry and reported by public broadcaster NHK. \u00a0 The report also says 850,000 patients would need ventilators. \"If\u00a0we receive the outbreak without any weapon to protect ourselves, the number of severe cases will exceed existing number of ventilators,\" Dr. Hiroshi Nishiura said, the head of the panel. \"All\ufffd\ufffdJapanese must change the pattern of action and help us to stop this outbreak as soon as possible,\" he added. Some context: Japan officially declared a state of emergency on April 7, months after the first domestic cases of the virus appeared. On Wednesday a public health emergency was issued for all of Japan by the commander of the US Forces\u00a0Japan\u00a0(USFJ)\u00a0amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.  ##Health## Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0said\u00a0the number of testing done in the US for coronavirus is \"far, far greater\" than two to three weeks ago.\u00a0 \"I believe the last number we spoke about the day before yesterday or today was close to or even at or beyond 3 million tests,\" Fauci said this morning on NBC. \"That's really far, far greater than we were two or three weeks ago.\" Fauci said the country is continuing to escalate and accelerate testing capabilities \"so that we would be able to have a significant number, measured in the millions, of tests each week.\" ##Health## The Czech government has announced a further easing of the containment measures it put in place to stop the spread of coronavirus. Final year university students can return to class next week, and primary schools may reopen at the end of May, the government announced on Tuesday evening. Starting in June, secondary and high schools can open for one-on-one teacher-pupil consultations. Students will also be allowed to take high school graduation exams and high school entry exams, but schools are not expected to fully reopen until September. Next week, the government will allow some businesses, including farmers\u2019 markets and car dealerships, to reopen.  Weddings can also take place from next week, provided that fewer than 10 people attend.  Restaurants, pubs and wine shops offering goods for immediate consumption can open at the end of May, if they have an outdoor patio or takeout options.  Museums, galleries and zoos can also open their outdoor installations at the end of May.  In June, retail shops, hotels and other accommodation services will be allowed to reopen.  The government did not provide an explanation as to how they arrived at these new measures. There are 6,151 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Czech Republic, the country's health ministry said. At least 161 people have died as a result of the virus.   Cycling\u2019s most famous race, the Tour de France, has been postponed until late August due to the coronavirus pandemic, the International Cycling Union (UCI) said on Wednesday. It will now run from Saturday August 29 to Sunday September 20. The move means the prestigious race will not take place in its traditional June-to-July slot for the first time since it restarted after World War II. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that no large-scale public events would take place in the country until mid-July, as part of measures to contain the outbreak. \u201cHolding this event in the best conditions possible is judged essential given its central place in cycling\u2019s economy and its exposure, in particular for the teams that benefit on this occasion from unparalleled visibility,\u201d the UCI said in a statement. Tour organisers have said that the event will follow the same route as originally planned, from Nice to Paris, and that an agreement had been reached with all the different parties involved, from local communities to public authorities. Along with the Giro d\u2019Italia and Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, the Tour de France makes up cycling's prestigious three-week-long \u201cGrand Tours\u201d. The UCI added that Italy's Giro and Spain's Vuelta would follow the Tour in a revised calendar, with dates yet to be confirmed. The UCI Road World Championships in Martigny, Switzerland, will go ahead as scheduled from Sunday 20 \u2013\u00a0Sunday 27 September. ##Travel## Airlines in China lost billions of dollars last quarter as the coronavirus pandemic took its toll on air travel. The country's airlines lost 33.62 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in the first quarter of 2020, according to figures released by the Civil Aviation Administration of China on Wednesday.\u00a0Passenger traffic plunged 54% to just over 74 million passengers. The nation's entire aviation industry --\u00a0including\u00a0airlines and airport operators\u00a0-- lost 39.82 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) in the quarter, the regulator said. The agency has taken steps to prop up the struggling sector, including lowering some fees for\u00a0airlines, like charges to park and land at airports. It said Wednesday that it will continue to keep an eye on the development of the outbreak. ##Travel## ##Business## A cancer ward in a German hospital has been hit by an outbreak of coronavirus cases. Around 20 patients and 20 employees tested positive for Covid-19 at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) last week, the hospital confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. Some of those patients are still being cared for at the Hamburg hospital, while others have since been sent home. ''The exact chain of infection is currently being investigated at full speed and cannot be traced back to a single person,\" a UKE spokesperson said. All the patients on the oncology ward were tested after the first infection became known, the UKE said. Infected patients were transferred to specific Covid-19 wards to continue their treatment. Staff members from a wide range of professions tested positive for the virus and are currently in isolation at home, the hospital statement concluded.\u00a0 Hamburg is one of Germany's coronavirus hotspots. A total of 3,869 people in the city have been infected with the virus and 67 have died, according to figures released Wednesday by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's disease control and prevention agency.  The EU\u2019s new long-term budget will need to be a \u201cstrong\u201d response to the coronavirus crisis, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says. \u201cI\u2019ve often said in the past that Europe needs a new Marshall Plan,\u201d she said, referring to the multi-billion dollar American stimulus package to rebuild Europe after World War II. \u201cWe\u2019ll need massive public and private investment to revive the economy, reconstruct it and to create new jobs.\u201d \u201cThe key to this is a strong new EU budget. The budget has the advantage that it enjoys the confidence, the trust of all member states.\u201d \u201cThis new seven-year budget has to distinguish itself from the previous ones. It will be different. It will be the European response to the coronavirus crisis.\u201d European Council President Charles Michel said Europe was facing\u00a0a \u201chuge and unprecedented\u201d crisis. He said the bloc\u2019s leaders would have to focus on \u201cthe need \u2013 the absolutely necessity \u2013 to develop a massive investment strategy\u201d to rebuild once the coronavirus crisis passes. Two scammers capitalising on the pandemic in the UK by illegally selling testing kits have been arrested, a statement from the National Crime Agency (NCA) said on Wednesday. A pharmacist was arrested and \u00a320,000 ($25,000) was seized in South London on Saturday under the Fraud Act 2006. The 46-year-old is accused of making \u201cfalse and misleading claims about the tests\u2019 capability.\u201d Separately, a 39-year-old surveyor was found with 250 Covid-19 testing kits in his car and was arrested after telling investigators \u201che was planning on selling the kits to construction workers,\u201d the statement said. Both were released on conditional bail.\u00a0 The NCA also said it had taken down a website designed to fool people \u201cinto buying suspected non-existent\u201d personal protection equipment (PPE) via phishing emails. \u201cCriminals capitalise on fear and anxiety and they will exploit any opportunity, no matter how awful, to line their pockets,\u201d said the NCA's Director of Investigations, Nikki Holland, adding that such scams \u201ccompletely undermine the nation\u2019s collective response to the pandemic and actually endangers lives.\u201d The British government has been criticized for failing to provide mass testing and PPE for healthcare workers and the public. The mayor of Moscow has admitted that the rollout of a new digital tracking system to enforce its coronavirus lockdown has caused crowding on public transportation, after images surfaced on Russian social media of large lines forming outside subway entrances as police checked passes. \u201cThis morning, due to verification activities conducted by the GUVD [police], queues formed in the metro, something very critical in the current situation,\u201d Sergey Sobyanin said in a statement on Twitter on Wednesday.  The new system officially went into operation Wednesday, requiring Muscovites and residents of the Moscow region to download a QR code so they can move around the Russian capital. Opposition activists warned the new system will lead to unprecedented government intrusion. For example, the permit website prompts all users to register at or link their existing page to a government e-portal, which stores user data on traffic fines, utility bills, foreign passports and so on. Users also need to disclose their points of origin and destination, their employer tax identifier, car plate number and upload their IDs. Daria Besedina and Maxim Katz, local opposition lawmakers who voted against the system, dubbed it a \"cyber Gulag\" and \"digital concentration camp,\" criticizing the authorities for mixed messaging about the coronavirus. \u201cI talked with the head of the Central Internal Affairs Directorate and asked them to organize work in such a way that further inspections would not lead to mass crowds of people,\" Sobyanin, the mayor, said on Twitter. He added that crowds had lessened and work was resuming at a normal pace.\u00a0 \u201cIn the future it will be necessary to move to automated control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll think about how to do this.\u201d Hundreds of migrant workers gathered outside the Bandra railway station in Mumbai on Tuesday evening to protest against the extension of India's nationwide lockdown.   The protesters called on police to allow them to leave the city and return to their home villages, said senior Mumbai police official Vijaylakshmi Hiremath.\u00a0 The protest broke out hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India's nationwide lockdown would be extended to May 3.   \"We had to use batons to control the crowd. No one was injured,\" said Dattaray Bhargude, senior police official to CNN. In an appeal to migrant workers Tuesday, the chief minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray said, \u201cYou have come from other states and stay here with us. There is a problem and a challenge and we will face this challenge together\u2026 You have come here, and you are living in this state and we will take complete care of you. There is no need for you to worry.\u201d\u00a0 Thackeray also said that the protest occurred because the workers were under the impression that they would be able travel once the initial 21-day lockdown period was up on Tuesday, had gathered at the station to board trains.\u00a0 \"Railways have not started any ticket booking at railway stations, but the online bookings were on for trains operational post the initial 21-day lockdown. Due to the extension in the lockdown the cancellations have been initiated on Tuesday for the extended lockdown period till May 3,\" said Ravindra Bhakar, a spokesperson for Western Indian Railways. Tuesday\u2019s protest mimicked a similar one which took place last week in the western state of Gujarat. More than 80 people were arrested after protesters threw stones as the police asked them to go back to their homes. Migrant workers across India have been restricted from heading back to their homes since the lockdown was announced last month. State governments have set up shelter homes to house the workers and have been working with NGOs to provide meals.\u00a0 To date, India has recorded a total of 11,439 confirmed cases, including 377 deaths. The EU\u2019s top diplomat says he \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s decision to suspend funding for the World Health Organization (WHO). The bloc\u2019s High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, said:\u00a0\u201cThere is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever to help contain & mitigate the coronavirus pandemic. Only by joining forces we can overcome this crisis that knows no borders.\u201d Trump\u00a0announced Tuesday he is halting funding to the WHO\u00a0while a review is conducted. He said the review would cover the WHO's \u201crole in severely mismanaging and covering up the\u00a0spread of coronavirus.\" The UK Government says that all nursing home residents with coronavirus symptoms will be tested -- although there\u2019s no specific timeframe for when that target will be achieved. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is \u201cdeeply conscious\u201d that nursing home residents are among the most vulnerable to the illness. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to keep workers, residents and their families safe, and I am determined to ensure that everyone who needs a coronavirus test should be able to have access to one,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\u201cAs we continue to ramp up our testing programme, we will test all current care home residents with coronavirus symptoms and all new care home residents who are discharged from hospital into care.\u201d The government has faced intense criticism from the aged care sector, which says it has been \u201cbadly let down\u201d by the lack of support. \u201cIt would not be an exaggeration that some are paying with their lives,\u201d older people's charity Age UK said last week. According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, there were 217 coronavirus-related deaths in nursing homes in England and Wales in the three weeks to April 3. Hancock says nursing home staff with symptoms will also be tested, and this will be rolled out nationwide \u201cover the coming days\u201d. \u201cTesting is key in our battle against coronavirus, and as part of our plan to prevent the spread and save lives we will ensure that everyone in social care who needs a test can have a test,\u201d he added. Spain has registered a daily increase of 1,220 active coronavirus cases -- the largest rise in more than a week -- according to Spanish Health Ministry data released Wednesday. This jump brought the country\u2019s total active cases to 88,201. The setback follows more positive news earlier in the week.  On Tuesday, Spain saw its first ever decrease in active cases, as the numbers of deaths and recovered people outnumbered new diagnoses. Spanish health officials have previously cautioned that numbers are higher on days following a weekend or a public holiday, such as Easter Monday. The country registered 523 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. This is one of the lowest increases in the past three weeks, and the lowest percentage increase, at 2.9%, since the first week of March.\u00a0 Spain\u2019s total death toll is now 18,579, with a total of 177,633 confirmed cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0 Analysis of new satellite images from the European Space Agency shows a dramatic reduction in pollution levels over India since a nationwide coronavirus lockdown was imposed three weeks ago. The analysis from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), an environmental organization, used satellite images from Sentinel-5P -- part of the European Space Agency program -- along with ground monitoring from CAAQMS (Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System). \"The analysis showed us drastic and clear reductions in pollution levels, which are a resultant of decreasing fossil fuel consumption in transportation, industries and energy sector,\" the CREA report says. An economy on lockdown: India, a nation of 1.3 billion people, has ground to a halt as a result of the lockdown, which has seen transport networks suspended, construction work halted, and factories, markets, and places of worship closed. Before-and-after images of major cities including Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengalaru, Chennai and Hyderabad show that since the shutdown began on March 24, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions over the cities -- depicted in orange -- has mostly cleared.  Nitrogen dioxide, which is released by vehicles and power plants, is a harmful pollutant which contributes to the deaths of 4.2 million people annually worldwide, according to the\u00a0World Health Organization.\u00a0 \"Hot-spots over major cities as well as major industrial/coal combustion-dominated areas have reduced significantly,\" due to \"falling pollution levels,\" the report says. \"The current crisis has shown us that clear skies and breathable air can be achieved very fast if concrete actions towards reducing burning of fossil fuels are taken,\" said the report's co-author, CREA analyst Sunil Dayiha. \"We feel that this could be the turning point for India towards securing the right to breathe and life for citizens of the country.\" India has 21 of 30 of the world\u2019s most polluted cities, according to the\u00a0IQAir AirVisual's 2019 World Air Quality Report.  Last week, people in the northern Indian state of Punjab reported that they could see the\u00a0Himalayas\u00a0for the first time in decades, due to the reduction in pollution. Donald Trump's decision to pull funding to the World Health Organization will weaken the global effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic and damage all of the world's countries, including the US itself, China has said. Trump announced on Tuesday that he was halting funding to the WHO, pending a review into the agency. He had previously accused the organization of being too \"China-centric.\" \"At present, the global pandemic situation is grim and is at a critical moment,\" China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters on Wednesday, adding that Trump's move would \"weaken WHO\u2019s abilities and undermine global cooperation on combating the pandemic.\" \"It will affect all countries in the world, including the United States -- especially those with vulnerable abilities,\" he said. \"We urge the US to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations, and support WHO to lead the international combat against the pandemic.\u201d Lijian also praised the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus's handling of the pandemic, and said the organization has \"actively performed its responsibilities and played a central coordination role in promoting international anti-pandemic cooperation, which has been widely recognized and highly praised by the international community.\" The US contributes $400 million to $500 million to the WHO each year, Trump said while announcing the move, noting that China \"contributes roughly $40 million.\" \"Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,\" Trump said. Russia reported 3,388 more cases of the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, the country's biggest single-day increase yet, according to its coronavirus response headquarters.\u00a0 Overall, Russia has 24,490 confirmed cases of the coronavirus.  The disease has now reached all of Russia\u2019s regions except for Altai\u00a0in West Siberia, one of the least populous in the country. The majority of cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a014,776\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are in Moscow. The city\u2019s health department said in a statement Tuesday that it expects to see a shortage of hospital beds in two to three weeks, and is working to prepare 24 more medical\u00a0facilities\u00a0to care for\u00a0an influx of coronavirus patients.\u00a0 US President Donald Trump stunned world leaders and health experts on Tuesday when he announced\u00a0he was halting funding\u00a0to the World Health Organization, in the middle of the\u00a0global coronavirus pandemic. He first threatened to do so last week, accusing the WHO of mismanaging the spread of the novel coronavirus, and of not acting quickly enough to investigate the virus when it first emerged in China in December 2019. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, which is the WHO's parent organization, described the pandemic as unprecedented in a statement on Tuesday, and acknowledged that there would be \"lessons learned\" for future outbreaks. \"Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis,\" he said in the statement. But what is the World Health Organization? What role has it played in the coronavirus pandemic and how vital is US funding to it? CNN has answered all your questions here. Frankfurt airport -- one of Europe's busiest terminals -- has seen a sharp decline in passenger and cargo traffic due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to its operator, Fraport.\u00a0 In a statement published on Wednesday, Fraport said Frankfurt airport had served some 2.1 million passengers in March -- a decline of 62% compared to March 2019. From January through to March 2020 passenger travel fell by nearly 25%.\u00a0\u00a0 The travel restrictions and the slump in demand caused by the COVID 19 pandemic had a massive impact,\" Fraport said in the statement, adding that the negative trend on traffic had continued in the first weeks of April and over the Easter holidays. During the week of April 6 to 12: Frankfurt airport's traffic plummeted by 96.8%\u00a0to 46,338 passengers,  compared to the same week in April 2019.\u00a0\nThe number of aircraft movements shrank by nearly 87% to 1,435 take-offs and landings.\u00a0\nThe volume of cargo (airfreight and airmail) fell by 28%\u00a0to 32,027 metric tons. Fraport added that ''a significant downward trend'' in traffic figures could also be felt ''at all international\u00a0locations.'' ##Travel## Donald Trump was in his element. Playing to a cheering crowd at a Detroit-area auto parts plant in January, the President railed against disgraceful Democrats, bad trade deals and the dishonest media as he touted his record of creating jobs \"like you have never seen before.\" The brewing\u00a0coronavirus crisis\u00a0merited only a brief mention at the end of his speech. He wanted to assure his audience that his administration had it \"very well under control.\" \"We think it's going to have a very good ending,\"\u00a0Trump said. Since then, an employee at the plant tested positive for coronavirus. Afterward, the plant ceased production, leaving its hourly workforce to collect unemployment.  The company, Dana Inc., which has locations around the globe, has seen its stock price plummet by more than 40% amid fears of the virus' uncontrolled spread. While government officials and public health experts have devoted years to efforts to enhance US preparedness for a pandemic, a key factor went overlooked: a President like Trump.

That's the stark warning from the International Monetary Fund, which said on Tuesday there was a risk of the\u00a0recession\u00a0extending into 2021 if policymakers\u00a0fail to coordinate a global response\u00a0to the virus. In its latest outlook for the world economy, the IMF said it expects GDP will contract by 3% in 2020, a far worse recession than the one that followed the global financial crisis of 2008, and a 180-degree reversal of its previous forecast in January when it was expecting growth of 3.3% this year. \"The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically. A partial recovery is projected for 2021 ... but the level of GDP will remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound,\" the IMF said. \"Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely,\" it added.

Jonathan David was handed six-month and 14-day prison terms Wednesday on two counts of \"failed to comply with a direction,\" and was ordered to serve one month of the sentences, while the rest would be suspended for one year. According to a media release by the West Australian Police Force, the man was an interstate traveler from Victoria state who was required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon his arrival on March 28. However, he was found to have wedged open a fire exit door at his hotel to leave and re-enter the property without being seen, and traveled on public transport to visit the metropolitan area of Perth. David was subsequently arrested on April 5 and has been accused by police of \"putting the community at risk,\" the notice said. ##Daily Life## World leaders have been working from home during the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic, and\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0is no exception: On Monday, the Russian President held a videoconference from his official residence outside Moscow with some of the officials leading the government's efforts to tackle the disease. It was an unusually somber meeting. Less than a month ago,\u00a0Putin had radiated confidence about his government's response\u00a0to a growing global crisis, reassuring his citizens that the situation was \"under control\" thanks to early intervention measures. A few weeks later, Putin played the role of international rescuer,\u00a0dispatching a planeload of medical supplies to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. How quickly things can change in the time of coronavirus. In his Monday videoconference, Putin took stock of a worsening situation. \"We have a lot of problems,\" Putin said. \"There is nothing to boast about, and we must not let our guard down, because in general, as you and your specialists say, we have not passed the peak of the epidemic yet.\" What's happening in Russia?: The trend line speaks for itself. While Russia has comparatively few cases compared with the United States or the hardest-hit European countries, the number of confirmed cases has surged in recent days. On Monday, Russia reported a record one-day rise in cases, with 2,558 confirmed over the previous 24 hours. On Tuesday, Russia hit a fresh record: 2,774 confirmed cases. And Putin is coming in for serious criticism over his handling of the crisis.

The vast majority of cases were linked to known clusters in the country, according to the Ministry of Health. The total number of new infections reported is slightly lower than the highest single day total of a day earlier, which was 386. A total of 3,252 cases have been confirmed in the country. ##Health## US President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0backed off his assertion of\u00a0absolute authority\u00a0over reopening the country, in an embarrassing tacit admission that he cannot force reluctant states to fire up the economy with the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0still rampant. And he continued to deflect from\u00a0criticism of his wider handling\u00a0of the coronavirus pandemic, singling out the\u00a0World Health Organization, which joined state governors, Democrats, former President Barack Obama, the news media, China, and America's European allies in being used by the President to shift focus from his own chaotic management. Trump has spent several days preparing the ground for his attack on the WHO with which he led his news conference.  He tapped into legitimate criticism of the WHO's response to the outbreak and complaints that it was too deferential to China and did not act quickly enough to raise the alarm about the novel coronavirus and its pandemic potential. \"It would have been so easy to be truthful. And so much death has been caused by their mistakes,\" Trump said about the WHO.  The facts show however that for all its faults, which are common to United Nations bodies paralyzed by politics, the WHO was far more proactive in warning about the virus than Trump, who was still denying its potency into March after predicting a \"miracle\" would make it go away.

In Taiwan, early intervention measures have controlled the coronavirus pandemic so successfully that it is now\u00a0exporting\u00a0millions of face masks to help the European Union and others. Germany has overseen the largest-scale coronavirus\u00a0testing\u00a0program in Europe, conducting 350,000 tests each week, detecting the virus early enough to isolate and treat patients effectively. In New Zealand, the prime minister took early action to\u00a0shut down\u00a0tourism and impose a month-long lockdown on the entire country, limiting coronavirus casualties to just four deaths. All three places have received accolades for their impressive handling of the coronavirus pandemic. They are scattered across the globe: one is in the heart of Europe, one is in Asia and the other is in the South Pacific. But they have one thing in common: they're all led by women. The success of these and other women-led governments in dealing with a global pandemic is all the more noteworthy, given that women make up less than\u00a07% of world leaders.

That might be surprising -- because recently the term wet market has become almost synonymous with Covid-19 for some people in the West. The novel coronavirus, which has infected close to 2 million people globally, is believed to have originated in a wet market\u00a0in the city of Wuhan,\u00a0where wild animals such as porcupines and deer were being sold and slaughtered for food and medicine. Speaking on April 3, the US' top infectious disease specialist, Anthony Fauci, told Fox News that all wet markets should be \"shut down right away,\" saying he couldn't understand why they were still open. But wet markets, as opposed to dry markets, which sell non-perishable goods such as grain or household products, are simply places that offer a wide range of fresh produce. Some, but not all, also sell live animals. They are referred to as \"wet\" owing to the fact that floors are often hosed down after vendors wash vegetables or clean fish. \"Abolishing wet markets may give the illusion of solving the cause of the current situation but the real problems are deeper than that,\" Petr Matous, an academic who specializes in environmental and humanitarian engineering at the University of Sydney, said in an email.

The decision to add Trump's name will not result in a delay for Americans receiving those checks, the senior administration official said. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0was first\u00a0to report on the news Tuesday. Two senior officials told the Post that the decision would probably set back the delivery date on the first set of paper checks -- potentially slowing a process that could already take up to 20 weeks. But the Treasury Department denied the claim, with a department spokesperson assuring the Post that the first batch of checks was still slated to go out next week. \"Economic Impact Payment checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned -- there is absolutely no delay whatsoever,\" the Treasury spokesperson told the paper.

Kristi Noem argued in a news conference on Tuesday. Noem is one of a handful of governors who has refused to issue such an order, rejecting a request from Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken. \u201cI've seen some national stories written that a shelter-in-place would have prevented this outbreak at Smithfield. That is absolutely false,\u201d Noem said.\u00a0 The plant accounts for 4% to 5% of US pork production and employs about 3,700 people, according to Smithfield. The governor said that even with a broad order, the facility would have stayed open due to its status as a major food supplier.\u00a0\u201cThis is a critical infrastructure job plant,\u201d she said. As of Tuesday, 438 Smithfield workers in Sioux Falls had tested positive for coronavirus, and the plant is shut down indefinitely.\u00a0But Noem said even a shelter-in-place order targeted only at the surrounding community would not be coming from her office.  \u201cThat could be a local decision that the mayor and city council could choose to do,\u201d Noem said.

The US may have to endure social distancing measures -- such as stay-at-home orders and school closures -- until 2022, researchers projected on Tuesday. That is, unless, a vaccine becomes quickly available. That's according to researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who published their findings in the\u00a0journal Science on Tuesday. Those findings directly contradict research being touted by the White House that suggests the pandemic may stop this summer. The team at the Harvard School of Public Health used what's known about Covid-19 and other coronaviruses to create possible scenarios of the current pandemic. \"Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available,\" they wrote in their report. \"Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.\" The Harvard team's projections also indicate that the virus would come roaring back fairly quickly once restrictions were lifted.

Some 609,240 infections have been confirmed in the United States since the outbreak began in January. CNN is tracking US coronavirus cases here: ##Health## Most of the pregnant women in New York who tested positive for the novel coronavirus -- one in eight -- were asymptomatic at time of delivery, according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday. The research was conducted between March 22 and April 4 at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital.  The center put a universal testing policy in place for all women admitted for delivery after the medical centers had two novel coronavirus cases confirmed among their patient population. Asymptomatic cases suggest universal testing important: Of the 215 pregnant women who delivered at these hospitals, four who tested positive for Covid-19 when they were admitted for delivery had a fever or some other symptoms of the coronavirus.  There were 29 others who tested positive for Covid-19 but did not have fever or any other symptoms of the disease.  The authors argue that this research shows that there are real potential benefits to conducting a universal test on patients.  Knowing if someone is infectious would help the hospital determine where to place the patients so they won\u2019t get other people sick, and would help guide the hospital\u2019s decisions on what personal protective equipment the staff may need. ##Health## Confirmed infections of coronavirus have more than tripled in Peru over the past week, the South American country's health ministry reported on Tuesday. A total of 10,303 cases have been confirmed in the country -- a jump from\u00a02,954\u00a0reported by authorities on April 7. On Monday, Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra said the rapid increase in cases is due to more people being tested across the country. The goal is to reach 12,000 tests a day, said Vizcarra, adding that more than 87,000 tests have been administered so far.\u00a0 As of Tuesday evening, 230 people have died from coronavirus in Peru, according to the health ministry. ##Health## As US companies struggle to remain in operation amid the coronavirus pandemic, the FBI is warning that American businesses now have something else to worry about: fraud by employees seeking to take advantage of the pandemic.\u00a0 In a report sent to companies across the nation Monday, and obtained by CNN, the FBI\u2019s Office of Private Sector notified members of private industry they should be on the lookout for fake doctors' notes and falsified documentation from employees claiming positive Covid-19 test results.\u00a0 The bureau report warned that the steps a company must take to stop business operations and sanitize work spaces could lead to significant financial loss.\u00a0 Alleged scam costs company $175,000: The FBI report described an incident in March where an employee working for an unidentified \u201ccritical manufacturing company\u201d told their bosses they had tested positive for Covid-19 and submitted what appeared to be documentation from a medical facility.\u00a0 \u201cIn response, the company shut down the affected manufacturing facility to disinfect the location, ceasing production and halting delivery of necessary materials to the plant,\u201d the FBI report stated. \u201cThe company notified all employees at the facility, including four workers who had close contact with the reportedly infected employee and were required to self-quarantine.\u201d Upon subsequent close review of the employee\u2019s medical documentation, supervisors became suspicious.\u00a0 The letter indicating the positive Covid-19 testing was not on official letterhead from a medical facility. A call to a telephone number listed on the documentation revealed the number was not actually associated with a location that conducted coronavirus testing at the time the letter was written.

South Korea's coronavirus outbreak peaked early, prompting praise for the government's handling of the pandemic. The country isn't in lockdown, and of the more than 10,500 confirmed cases, at least 7,400 have recovered. Nevertheless, the country has taken precautions. What's the election for? Around 44 million people are registered to vote in South Korea's legislative election, where they will elect 300 members of the National Assembly. At least 26% of registered voters cast their vote early. How are voters being kept safe? When voters head to the polls today, they will have their temperature checked at the door.\u00a0They'll need to stand at least one meter apart from each other as they line up. Polling booths will be regularly disinfected and\u00a0anyone with a temperature of more than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Farenheit) will have to vote in a special booth. About 20,000 additional workers will be dispatched to put in place the extra measures. What about voters who are still in quarantine? Special voting booths have been set up at government-run isolation centers, and those under self-quarantine will be allowed to leave their house to vote after polling booths close to the public at 6 p.m. How did the run-up to the election differ from normal? Politicians still held rallies and hit the streets to meet voters, but it was definitely different from normal campaign periods, which often involve\u00a0K-pop style dance troupes.\u00a0This time around, politicians wore gloves and face masks -- one even wore a face visor. Will turnout be lower than normal? One of the big concerns with running an election during a pandemic is that people may decide not to vote as they're afraid of getting sick. Statistics from the National Election Commission show that so far, turnout is actually slightly higher than it was at the last election.  Some voters CNN talked to in the lead-up said the pandemic made voting even more important.

Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that the state will have access to 1 million N95 masks. \"Today, in consultation from the White House, we have received or will receive a total of 1 million N95 masks, those are probably the most sought after piece of PPE right now, there's obviously been a worldwide run on that. Working with the White House, they've earmarked us a million,\" DeSantis said at a news conference Tuesday. He said Florida's Emergency Management Department will also be delivering 1.2 million\u200bprocedure masks, 100,000 face shields, 500,000 gloves, 60,000 containers of hand sanitizer, and 35,000 gowns.

They basically hid information from the public, they failed to call this a pandemic long after others had rightfully done so. There is blood on their hands. I think President Trump is absolutely correct to have a full investigation of how that happened and what China\u2019s role might\u2019ve been to that,\" Navarro said. Pressed on how this could impact future trade negotiations with China, he called those \u201cinteresting questions\u201d but went on to talk about supply chains. Asked again later in the interview how coronavirus will impact the US-China relationship, Navarro said, \u201cWe have to find out where it originated. We have to understand why China did not tell us for six weeks in which we lost precious time preparing for a pandemic.\u201d \u201cThis is something we will not forget: China was basically vacuuming up the world\u2019s PPE around the world so that we didn\u2019t have it in New York and people didn\u2019t have it in Milan,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a question that has to be answered. The question going forward is will they provide the PPE to the world as we go through this crisis without strings?\u201d ##Health## Honolulu will require people to wear facial coverings when visiting essential businesses from Monday.\u00a0 Mayor Kirk Caldwell said the new requirement applies to businesses like grocery stores. People will not be required to have a commercially-produced mask, he said. \"It's another layer of protection.\u00a0It's not perfect,\" Caldwell said at a news conference on Tuesday. The mayor said the order does not apply to people working in offices that are not open to the public, although facial coverings are still recommended at those businesses.\u00a0People also must cover their faces when riding public transportation. To avoid confusion, Caldwell said there is one major exception to the rule: no one should wear a mask in a bank. \"Usually when people go into a bank with a mask, it's not a good outcome,\" Caldwell said. ##Daily Life## ##Business## The largest professional association of physicians in the US, the American Medical Association, labeled President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will put a hold on funding for the World Health Organization as \u201cdangerous.\u201d AMA President Dr. Patrice A. Harris issued a statement today in response to Trump's announcement. Here's a portion of her statement: \u201cDuring the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating Covid-19 easier.\nFighting a global pandemic requires international cooperation and reliance on science and data. Cutting funding to the WHO \u2013 rather than focusing on solutions \u2013 is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world. The AMA is deeply concerned by this decision and its wide-ranging ramifications, and we strongly urge the President to reconsider.\u201d What we know: During a White House news briefing today, Trump announced he will halting funding while a review is conducted. ##Health## The surgery chair of a New York City hospital says more patients are departing than arriving. Dr. Craig Smith of the\u00a0New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center also said the number of patients in the Intensive Care Unit and on ventilators appears to be leveling off at two hospitals that are bearing the brunt of those cases. Smith wrote these details in a daily note to faculty and staff. \u201cThese trends support our pivot towards restoration of normal,\u201d Smith wrote. There are also fewer autopsies:\u00a0Smith said autopsies have become uncommon in most settings, and notes \u201cphone consent is not considered acceptable\u201d \u201cWe have very little idea why Covid-19 is so lethal and resistant to treatment in certain patients,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAutopsy in Covid mortalities has a relatively high probability of contributing to the advancement of medical science.\" He added: \"Because phone consent is not considered acceptable -- a significant hurdle when visitors are not allowed. We are pursuing solutions to that unintended consequence of an administrative policy that was less often objectionable pre-pandemic.\u201d ##Health## US President Donald Trump announced Tuesday he is halting funding to the World Health Organization while a review is conducted. Trump said at a news conference the review would cover the WHO\u2019s \u201crole in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus.\u201d The President said that while the US imposed travel restrictions on China during the early stages of the outbreak, the WHO was \"opposed to what we did.\" \"Other nations and regions who\u00a0followed WHO guidelines and\u00a0kept their borders open to\u00a0China, accelerated the pandemic\u00a0around the world,\" Trump said. Trump continued: \"The decision of other major\u00a0countries to keep travel open\u00a0was one of the great tragedies\u00a0and missed opportunities from\u00a0the early days.\" ##Travel## ##Health##"], "Language": false}
