Henson posted a black-and-white photo of Johnson on her verified Instagram account, writing in the caption, \"Thank you QUEEN #KatherineJohnson for sharing your intelligence, poise, grace and beauty with the world!\" \"Because of your hard work little girls EVERYWHERE can dream as big as the MOON!!!,\" Henson wrote. \"Your legacy will live on FORVER AND EVER!!! You ran so we could fly!!!\" Johnson was part of a group of black women working at NASA that played a crucial role in the early days of spaceflight.
