Mino Raiola hit out at Solskjaer after the Norwegian said in a pre-game news conference that \"Paul is our player, not Mino's.\" Raiola, agent to some of the world's best players including Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, has suggested that the French international could return to Juventus next season. \"Paul is not mine and for sure not Solskjaer's property, Paul is Paul Pogba's (property),\" Raiola said, responding to Solskjaer. \"You cannot own a human being already for a long time in the UK or anywhere else.

Raiola added: \"I am a free citizen who can think and express my thoughts. Until now I was maybe nice to him. Solskjaer should just remember things that he said in the summer to Paul. \"I think Solskjaer may be frustrated for different reasons and is now mixing up some issues. I think that Solskjaer has other things to worry about. At least if I was him I would.\"  Solskjaer was asked about Raiola's comments following United's 2-0 win over Chelsea Monday, which came courtesy of goals from Anthony Martial and Harry Maguire.  \"I don't have to comment through the media on Mino, I can probably speak to him myself,\" the former United star told Sky Sports. \"It's not my area, Paul and Mino have their conversations and that's fine.\" READ: What now for Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's Champions League ban?
