With a whopping 6.5 billion views, the music clip topped the list. And this is not the first time \"Despacito,\" which means \"slowly\" in Spanish, has made YouTube history.

'Uptown Funk' Sitting at No. 4 are Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars with 3.7 billion views. This song reached the top of the charts in 2015, remained there for 14 weeks, and became the longest-leading Billboard Hot 100 of the 2010s at the time. 'Gangnam Style' With 3.4 billion views, PSY's music video not only made the top five, it broke YouTube in 2014 by surpassing the average views the platform could handle at that time.   'Sorry' Is it too late now to say sorry ... that this video didn't top the chart? Justin Bieber's 2015 hit made it into our hearts with 3.2 billion views.

The song was used as a campaign theme for Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated by a major political party for President of the United States.
