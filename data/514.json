Arranged by the World Photography Organisation, the awards' annual Open competition recognizes the year's best single images across categories including architecture, portraiture and still life. The 10 category winners will now compete for the $5,000 overall prize. Also in the running are Jorge Reynal's depiction of a dead fish caught in a plastic bag and Santiago Mesa's image of a protester being detained by riot police in the Colombian city of Medellin. A picture of revelers on stage at an Iggy Pop concert and a portrait of Pixies front man Charles Thompson (better known as Black Francis) were also named as category winners.  The images, all taken in 2019, were chosen from 100 shortlisted entries. Three of the 10 winners hail from Australia, with two from both China and the UK, and one each from Colombia, Italy and Argentina.   Earlier this month, organizers announced that the annual awards ceremony will not go ahead as planned amid the coronavirus pandemic. An accompanying exhibition at London's Somerset House, originally set to open Friday, has also been canceled. The judges will instead announce the winners online on June 9. Now in its 13th year, the Sony World Photography Awards will also honor individual photographers in professional and student categories. Last year, Italian artist Federico Borella was named Photographer of the Year for his series \"Five Degrees,\" which explored suicide among male farmers in drought-ridden Tamil Nadu.
