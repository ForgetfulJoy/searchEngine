Coronavirus\u00a0 President Trump issued a grave, sobering warning during a coronavirus briefing, preparing the country for 100,000 to 240,000 coronavirus deaths in the coming weeks. It is the first time the administration has laid the numbers bare in such a straightforward way. Dread is spreading in other parts of the world as well, like in Hong Kong, where beauty parlors, night clubs and karaoke rooms have been shut down as the region contends with a second wave of coronavirus cases. The CDC now says that\u00a0as many as\u00a0one-fourth of those infected with the virus could be walking around with no symptoms and transmitting it, which makes social distancing measures all the more crucial. This growing public concern has led China to start counting asymptomatic cases in its official tally. There are now more than 860,000 coronavirus cases worldwide and more than 42,000 deaths.\u00a0Follow here for live updates.\u00a0 2. Census\u00a0 It's Census Day in the US, when local leaders encourage people to complete and return their census forms. That part's not optional -- participation in the census is required by law -- but there are\u00a0plenty of reasons to comply. Census numbers determine\u00a0how many representatives each state gets in Congress\u00a0and how billions of dollars in federal funding get\u00a0spent. Schools, roads\u00a0and other crucial community components will gain -- or lose -- money over the next 10 years depending on this official population tally. This is also the first time the census can be completed online. If you don't complete the forms, expect a visit from a census taker later in the year who may interview you to make sure everyone is counted.\u00a0 3. Prisons\u00a0 The coronavirus crisis is having a particularly dangerous impact on prison systems.\u00a0The US federal prison system announced it will move to a heightened state of lockdown as it fights the spread of the disease behind bars. This means\u00a0inmates will largely\u00a0be confined to their cells for a two-week period. Prisoners in Washington\u00a0DC and Texas are suing their correctional systems for better access to soap and paper towels amid the outbreak.\u00a0Some inmates reported having to use the same towel to bathe, dry their hands and clean their cells. Meanwhile, dozens of inmates have tested positive for Covid-19 at the Cook County jail in Chicago. It's\u00a0the largest single site jail in the country, and the rise in cases means it could become a hot spot for the disease.\u00a0 4. Election 2020 It's a new frontier for politicians campaigning in the age of social distancing and lockdowns. Local leaders are connecting with voters\u00a0from\u00a0their homes or through Facebook Live events, and\u00a0Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden has been broadcasting (and podcasting) from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden's campaign also released a new digital ad responding to the coronavirus crisis, casting the former vice president\u00a0as a leader who could empathize with Americans during difficult times. As July's Democratic convention edges closer amid the pandemic, New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania are to latest states\u00a0to push their primaries to June. Wisconsin, however, is still planning to hold its election on Tuesday.\u00a0 5. Venezuela The Trump administration has launched a new effort to oust embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in hopes of facilitating a democratic transition in the ailing socialist state.\u00a0The plan points to Venezuela's coronavirus response as a reason to get rid of Maduro.\u00a0Under the plan, Venezuela's National Assembly would create a Council of State to serve as the governing body until presidential elections are held. This new strategy comes less than a week after the US Justice Department announced narco-terrorism charges against Maduro and senior Venezuelan leaders.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE A 112-year-old British pensioner is the world's oldest man\u00a0 That's a LOT of birthday candles.\u00a0 A few tips to survive working at home with your spouse\u00a0 Don't look each other in the eye.
