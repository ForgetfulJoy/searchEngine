The latest teen trend, explained"], "Section": ["cnn-underscored"], "MappedSection": [null], "Article_Body": ["In the age of TikTok, many a persona has arisen.  Whereas a few months ago everyone was breaking down what a VSCO girl was and how to look like one, now the focus is shifting to another, equally dominant personality type omnipresent on the hugely popular app. Meet the e-girl (and e-boy, but for now it seems the trend is mainly in girls' hands). While she mainly lives on TikTok, her presence is seeping into other social media realms, too. Search \"#egirl\" on Instagram, for example, and you'll surface more than 1.2 million posts.  What is an e-girl? A diehard TikTok-er, the e-girl \u2014 or \"electronic girl\" \u2014 shares solely from her bedroom and vamps up her appearance to embody the title. She's got pigtails and a miniskirt, chains and heavy anime-esque makeup that almost makes her look like a kewpie doll (albeit with fake tattoos). Or maybe Harley Quinn, if she were a teenager. Most often she appears in \"e-girl factory\" or \"e-girl juice\" TikTok video memes, where a normal-looking girl enters a factory (or drinks juice) and reappears as a highly styled e-girl. Of course, all of this is set to music, often a cover of the Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\" by Why Mona, with all the girls doing a similar dance routine that involves hip swaying and robot arms.  But appearances and dance moves aside, e-girls more importantly embody a new Gen Z vibe. If VSCO girls are the sunshine-basking hippies of 2020, e-girls are the opposite. They don't ride around in Jeeps and they're definitely not at the beach. They live online, they stream from their bedrooms and they are utterly counterculture, preferring to be outsiders (who remain inside) swathed in today's take on grunge and Goth.  How to be an e-girl Like VSCO girls, e-girls have lots of trappings, from hairstyles and makeup galore to very specific outfits and accessories. Also, there's lots of sticking your tongue out. And lots of pink blush. If you're considering joining the movement, you'll need to invest in clips, scrunchies, a curling iron wand and some hair chalk or dye \u2014 and that's just for your hair. (You might want to consider a nose ring, too.) Whether you find e-girls confusing or intriguing, this we know: The trend is no flash in the pan. It's here to stay (for now) and it's huge, so we might as well learn to embrace it \u2014 or at least understand it.  Follow our guide to become more familiar with the look, and who knows, you might even find some products for yourself, too.
