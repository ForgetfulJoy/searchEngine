With many of us social distancing or at least working from home, what better time to bring those beloved cocktails right into your living room?  An important part of cocktail culture is aesthetics \u2014 not just what your finished drink looks like, but also the space that stores your cocktail supplies and the tools themselves. For some of us, that means upping our game to an adult bar cart. If this is your first time acquiring or setting up a bar cart, take a deep breath and get ready to play.  \"The main objective is that your bar cart be pleasing to you,\" says home mixologist Paula Garner, aka @thebitterfairy. \"Whether that means it's a shiny and wheeled modern piece, or a rustic repurposed table or cabinet. Whether it's practical \u2014 that it holds the things you use most \u2014 or that it is beautiful or evocative. Maybe you're drawn to unusual bottles, maybe you really want a place to feature that delightfully tacky hula girl lamp.\"  And remember, how you set up your bar cart isn't permanent. \"You can change it on a whim to reflect your personal journey and interests,\" Garner says.  To help you get started on your bar cart journey, we rounded up some of our favorite stylish bar carts across the internet, as well as everything you need to stock them.

Stocking your bar cart  Once you've selected your bar cart, it's time to get it stocked. The absolute basics are simple, Garner says: A shaker, a strainer, something for measuring liquids, and glassware. \"It doesn't have to be new or pricey and it doesn't even have to match \u2014 my collection is mostly single glasses \u2014 but you do want a darling coupe for those foamy sours and sturdy rocks glasses for a stirred drink or a neat pour,\" she says.   Add more elements as you see fit \u2014 an ice bucket, spirits decanters, fancy tools, cute objects. \"Let go of any notion of what a cocktail cart is supposed to look like and let yourself go rogue,\" Garner says. \"The best and most interesting collections of bar things are personal, the ones that spark your own creativity and pleasure.\" Glasses  Fleur Coupe Glasses, Set of 4 ($56; anthropologie.com) Streamlined on the top, undulating interest on the bottom, these coupes are perfect for sparkling wine or a martini-style drink. _______________________________________________________________________________ Threshold Telford Glass Tumblers, Set of 12 ($17.99, originally $19.99; target.com) Six short and six tall, these will meet most any mixed-drink serving need and work well for beer and water, and the price is right.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Handblown Moroccan Glasses, Set of 6 (starting at $36; food52.com) Because making drinks at home should feel extra special at this uncertain time.   _______________________________________________________________________________ French Picardie Pastel Tumblers, Set of 6 ($36; food52.com) Extra festive when we need a little cheer, these welcome wine or cocktails and are fun for kids, too. _______________________________________________________________________________ Seaside: Sea Foam Bubble Glass Tumbler Set by Twine ($26.39; walmart.com) Every bar needs a highball glass, and these feel happy. _______________________________________________________________________________ Shakers S'well Teakwood Cocktail Shaker Set ($40; crateandbarrel.com) A stylish-modern combo of faux distressed wood and stainless steel.
