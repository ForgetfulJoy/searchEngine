Bernie Sanders. CNN's Chris Cillizza broke down some of the winners tonight: Elizabeth Warren/Kamala Harris/Stacey Abrams/Amy Klobuchar: Biden pledged unequivocally\u00a0he will pick a woman to be his vice president.\nPresident Trump: With the exception of an occasional reference here and there, Trump was barely mentioned.\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance: In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the debate had no live audience and Sanders and Biden elbow-bumped instead of shaking hands. And here's a look at the losers: Bernie Sanders/Joe Biden: Both men had good moments. Both had bad moments. But overall, they spent two hours attacking each other's voting records \u2014 often focusing on the sort of legislative minutiae (Hyde Amendment!) that the average voter simply tunes out. Read more analysis from Cillizza here. ##Sanders## ##Biden## During the debate, former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that the US chose not to take testing kits for the coronavirus from the World Health Organization. \u201cLook, the World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own.\u201d\u00a0 Facts first:\u00a0Biden is correct. The US, along with other countries, chose not to take test kits from WHO \u2013 and instead\u00a0decided to make their own.\u00a0\u00a0 Laboratories in Germany developed tests to detect the coronavirus which WHO adopted and by\u00a0March 3, WHO sent out test kits to 47 countries. Other countries, like the US and China, chose to develop their own tests,\u00a0according to the Washington Post.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That decision by the US government not to take the WHO test kits has come under scrutiny as testing has been slow to roll out across the country\u00a0and due to some early failures to verify those tests at other laboratories in the US. On February 12, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0reported\u00a0that some of the coronavirus test kits shipped to labs across the country were\u00a0not working as they should. As a result, the CDC remade parts of the test kits after some produced inconclusive test results. As of\u00a0Sunday, almost two months after the coronavirus was first detected in the US, 22,713 specimens had been tested in the US. Experts have criticized the country\u2019s seeming inability to produce more tests. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the experts leading the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus,\u00a0told\u00a0Congress Thursday that the US was \u201cfailing\u201d when it came to getting Americans tested.\u00a0 \u201cIt is a failing, let\u2019s admit it,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThe idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we\u2019re not set up for that.\u201d ##Coronavirus## ##Biden## Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders blasted President Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, saying he's \"undermining the good work of\u00a0scientists.\" Sanders went on to say that Trump keeps making\u00a0\"absurd remarks,\" calling him \"arrogant\" and \"ignorant.\" \"A president who had a brain in\u00a0his head would have brought the\u00a0scientists together and said,\u00a0'Look, how serious is this, what\u00a0do we? what do we do now?'\u00a0Not talk about, well, I have ... I have an\u00a0unusual ability to understand\u00a0the issue or it's going to all\u00a0clear up,\" he said. Sanders continued: \"This is not what the people of\u00a0this country or the world need.\" He said this is also a time of reflection, suggesting that \"we have to\u00a0move incredibly\u00a0aggressively in terms of the\u00a0coronavirus.\" \"What happens after this crisis\u00a0is over, and it will be over,\u00a0are we satisfied with the health\u00a0care system which is not a\u00a0system?\u00a0At the end of the day, we have\u00a087 million people who are really\u00a0nervous about whether they can\u00a0afford to go to the doctor or\u00a0not,\" Sanders said. Watch: ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Four states have primaries scheduled for Tuesday: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. But as the coronavirus outbreak spreads, officials with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have encouraged the cancellation of any gathering that will draw more than 50 people.  Sen. Bernie Sanders was just asked if he thinks the Tuesday primaries should go on as planned. \"That is a very good question,\" Sanders said. \"Look, you know, elections, dates\u00a0are very, very important.\u00a0We don't want to be getting in\u00a0the habit of messing around with\u00a0them.\" He added: \"I would hope that governors listen to\u00a0the public health experts, and\u00a0what they are saying is \u2014 you\u00a0just indicated \u2014 we don't want\u00a0gatherings of more than 50\u00a0people.\u00a0I'm thinking about some of the\u00a0elderly people sitting behind\u00a0the desks, registering people,\u00a0doing all that stuff.\u00a0Does that make a lot of sense?\u00a0I'm not sure that it does.\" Watch: ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Asked whether he would order a national lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joe Biden took a swipe at Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \"Medicare for All\" proposal. He pointed to Italy, saying that its\u00a0single-payer\u00a0health care\u00a0system hasn\u2019t worked to stem the outbreak there.\u00a0 \u201cIt has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That would not solve the problem at all,\u201d Biden said at CNN\u2019s Democratic Debate on tonight.\u00a0 Facts first:\u00a0This is partly true. As the experience of Italy and other countries shows, having universal coverage and a government-run health system is not enough on its own to stem\u00a0the spread of\u00a0coronavirus. But the US is at a disadvantage in fighting the coronavirus because tens of millions of Americans are uninsured or face high out-of-pocket costs before their insurance kicks in \u2014 which may make people hesitant to seek testing or treatment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Health care experts in the US are concerned that coronavirus will spread more widely because ill Americans will avoid getting checked out because of the potential cost. Medicare for All calls for all Americans to have coverage with no out-of-pocket charges.\u00a0 Nearly 28 million non-elderly people \u2014\u00a0or 10.4%\u00a0\u2014\u00a0were uninsured\u00a0in 2018, according to the US Census Bureau.\u00a0And\u00a0those\u00a0who have\u00a0insurance\u00a0through their jobs\u00a0still\u00a0face annual deductibles of about $1,655, on average, before coverage kicks in, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Employer Health Benefits Survey.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Addressing coronavirus with tens of millions of people without health insurance or with inadequate insurance will be a uniquely American challenge among developed countries,\"\u00a0Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser, tweeted. \"It will take money to treat people and address uncompensated care absorbed by providers.\"\u00a0 But federal and state officials, as well as insurers, have stepped up to make sure that Americans can get the coronavirus test at no cost. Many insurers have said they will waive fees for certain\u00a0members.\u00a0Several states have also required insurers to waive the cost of the test\u00a0for some policyholders.\u00a0 The House bipartisan legislative package, which lawmakers passed in the early hours of Saturday morning, also calls for \"free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to House Democrats.\u00a0 President Trump has tweeted his support of the package. The Senate\u00a0is\u00a0expected to take up the measure when it returns to session this week.\u00a0 ##Coronavirus## ##Biden## ##Sanders## Former Vice President Joe Biden said early in Sunday\u2019s Democratic debate that he would handle the coronavirus like the Obama administration took on the 2014 Ebola crisis. What did that mean? The fast-moving Ebola epidemic in West Africa was what the World Health Organization labeled the \u201clargest, most severe and most complex\u201d Ebola epidemic in history. More than 28,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 died. The outbreak started in March 2014 and the initial US response was considered by some slow and inadequate, but by August of that year, the Obama administration staged what scholars say is the largest American intervention in a global public health crisis. Congress approved $5.4 billion of the $6.2 billion Obama had asked for in emergency Ebola funding that went to support international efforts and to create infrastructure in the US to fight emerging infectious disease. The US sent more than 3,500 personnel from multiple agencies to fight the epidemic, mobilizing staff from the Department of Defense, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service, the US Agency for International Development and the National Institutes of Health. The medical experts provided direct care to patients and performed basic public health services like contact tracing to help stop the spread of the disease. The experts trained more than 1,500 local healthcare workers. It also educated citizens on disease prevention and partnered with locals to create nearly 200 safe burial teams. The US military also built 11 Ebola treatment units in the region and oversaw the creation of five others. These ETU\u2019s cared for patients, isolated Ebola patients from others, and tested people for the disease.\u00a0The Department of Defense brought seven mobile labs to the region speeding up testing. The US also built a medical unit in Liberia that cared for healthcare workers that got sick caring for patients. In the US, the Obama administration set up Ebola screening at airports, provided national training for health care workers and created an infrastructure of 51 Ebola treatment centers in 16 states that continue to manage emerging infectious diseases. The unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Center is currently being used to care for novel coronavirus patients.\u00a0 The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease initiated work on an Ebola vaccine and that research continues. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden just wrapped up their first one-on-one debate tonight in Washington, DC, with a message to Americans on coronavirus. Here's a portion of what they said: Biden: \"This is about America.\u00a0This is about the world.\u00a0This is about how we bring\u00a0people together and make the\u00a0kind of sacrifices we need to\u00a0make to get this done.\u00a0So first and foremost what we\u00a0have to do is start to listen to\u00a0the science again. ...\u00a0Donald Trump has exacerbated\u00a0every single one of these\u00a0problems, both the immediate\u00a0urgent need and how we're going\u00a0to hold people harmless for the\u00a0damage done as a consequence of\u00a0this virus.\u00a0It's important we do both.\" Sanders: \"This is a time to move\u00a0aggressively, dealing with the\u00a0coronavirus crisis, dealing with\u00a0the economic fallout.\u00a0But it is also time to rethink\u00a0America and create a country\u00a0where we care about each other\u00a0rather than a nation of greed\u00a0and corruption which is what is\u00a0taking place among the corporate\u00a0elite.\" ##Biden## ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were just asked about their weaknesses in the 2020 race. CNN's Dana Bash pointed out that Sanders has done better with Hispanic voters than Biden. Biden insisted that his message is \"resinating\u00a0across the board,\" and pointed to several states that he's won. \"Why is it that I'm winning all those\u00a0places?\u00a0What's the reason?\" Biden asked. \"The reason is because they know\u00a0I am a Democrat with a capital\u00a0\"D\" who believes our that base is the\u00a0base of the Democratic Party.\" Bash went on to mention that Sanders' campaign is struggling to gain wide support from black voters. \"I think it's imperative that we\u00a0defeat Trump. I think our\u00a0campaign of a biracial,\u00a0bi-generational \u2014 multigenerational grassroots\u00a0movement is the way to do it,\" Sanders said. Sanders added his campaign is \"winning the ideological struggle.\" Watch: ##Sanders## ##Biden## Bernie Sanders defended his previous comments praising Fidel Castro\u2019s regime in Cuba for literacy programs, arguing he was simply acknowledging reality.\u00a0 \u201cWe condemn authoritarianism whether it\u2019s in China, Russia, Cuba, anyplace else. But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would, I think, be incorrect,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 Joe Biden criticized Sanders and defended similar comments from former President Barack Obama, saying that Obama \u201cwas trying to change Cuban policy so the Cuban people would get out from under the thumb\u201d of Castro\u2019s regime. Biden said that \u201cthese are flat-out dictators, period, and they should be called for it, straight-up.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama was more generous in his praise of what Cuba did in health care and education than I was. I was talking about a program 60 years ago, in the first year of the Castro revolution,\u201d Sanders responded.\u00a0 Watch: ##Sanders## Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden agreed on a host of climate change policies on Sunday, but the Vermont senator highlighted his far more aggressive policies on the issue. \u201cAll well and good, but\u00a0nowhere near enough,\u201d Sanders said after Biden listed a series of his policies. \u201cI look at climate change in\u00a0exactly the same way,\u201d Sanders said, labeling the fight against climate change a \u201cwar-like\u00a0situation.\u201d \u201cIt's not a question of\u00a0reentering the Paris accord.\u00a0That's fine.\u00a0Who cares?\u00a0Not a big deal.\u201d \u201cWhat Joe is saying goes nowhere\u00a0near enough.\u00a0It's not a question of money,\" Sanders said. \"This is a world changing event,\u201d he added. Biden\u2019s defend his approach, touting the fact that he would cut subsidies to fossil fuel counties and end offshore drilling. \u201cThe fact that he says\u2026 Paris accord doesn't\u00a0mean much.\u00a0We can get everything exactly\u00a0right.\u00a0We're 15% of the problem.\u00a085% of the problem is over\u00a0there,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe need someone who can deal\u00a0internationally.\u00a0We need someone to bring the\u00a0world together again.\u00a0We need someone who can move in a\u00a0direction that, in fact, if you\u00a0violate the commitment you make,\u00a0you will pay an economic price\u00a0for it.\u201d Watch: ##Biden## ##Sanders## Joe Biden praised two proposals from his current and former presidential rivals that he recently embraced as he attempts to consolidate the party behind him and pivot to a general election against President Donald Trump.\u00a0 Univision's Ilia Calder\u00f3n\u00a0asked Biden at Sunday's debate, \u201cYesterday, you endorsed an\u00a0Elizabeth Warren plan that would\u00a0undo key parts of the bankruptcy law you helped pass in 2005.\u00a0A few hours ago, you announced\u00a0support for making public\u00a0college tuition free for\u00a0families who make less than\u00a0$125,000 a year, something Senator Sanders has supported. What changed?\u201d\u00a0 Biden said the 2005 bankruptcy bill that he clashed with Warren on at the time was going to passing overwhelmingly in a Republican-controlled Congress, and that he offered amendments to improve the bill.\u00a0 \u201cI did not like the rest of the\u00a0bill, but I improved it,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 Biden said he talked to Warren about her bankruptcy proposal two nights ago, and said, \u201cThis is the first opportunity we\u2019ve had to make substantial\u00a0change in what we couldn't get\u00a0done in a Republican administration.\"\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a good proposal. It\u2019s a solid proposal. And she should get credit for having\u00a0introduced it,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 Biden also offered praise for Sanders' bill on free public university tuition, and called it a \u201cgood idea.\u201d \u201cThe exact bill that Sen. Sanders introduced I guess a little over\u00a0a year ago, capping it off at\u00a0$125,000 in income, you could\u00a0get free up to that point, after that you\u2019d have to pay for\u00a0college education.\u00a0It only worked for public\u00a0schools and it would work for public\u00a0universities in your state,\" Biden said.  \u201cI support that idea,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cIt was a good idea.\u00a0And I support it.\" Watch: ##Biden## Joe Biden committed tonight that he would choose a woman to be his vice president. \"There are a number of women\u00a0qualified to be president\u00a0tomorrow.\u00a0I would pick a\u00a0woman\u00a0to be my\u00a0vice president,\" he said. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders said \"in all likelihood, I will.\" \"For me, it's not just nominating\u00a0a\u00a0woman.\u00a0It is making sure that we have a\u00a0progressive\u00a0woman\u00a0and there are\u00a0progressive women out there.\u00a0So my very strong tendency is\u00a0to move in that direction,\" he added. Watch: ##Sanders## ##Biden## Joe Biden extended an olive branch to Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters tonight, attempting to minimize their differences on issues like health care, student debt, education and climate change.\u00a0 \u201cWe disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don\u2019t disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 He said that \u201cif Bernie\u2019s the nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign for him.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis is much bigger than whether I\u2019m the nominee or Bernie\u2019s the nominee,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 Sanders said he, too, would campaign for the Democratic nominee. But he rejected Biden\u2019s effort to suggest their policy objectives are similar, saying that \u201cdetails make a difference.\u201d\u00a0 Biden said at the beginning of his answer that he\u2019d moved left on free public university tuition and bankruptcy reform. \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now. I\u2019ve been trying to give him credit for things and he won\u2019t even take the credit,\u201d Biden said. Watch: ##Biden## ##Sanders## Bernie Sanders criticized Joe Biden\u2019s voting record during his time in the Senate, faulting the former US senator from Delaware for voting for the Defense of Marriage Act, trade agreements like NAFTA, authorization for the War in Iraq and for a 2005 bill on bankruptcy. Biden fired back by noting Sanders repeatedly voted against the Brady Handgun\u00a0Violence Prevention\u00a0Act, a sweeping bill that looked to curb gun violence. \u201cI voted against the Defense of Marriage Act.\u00a0You voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the bankruptcy\u00a0bill, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the war in Iraq,\u00a0which was also a tough vote, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the disastrous\u00a0trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR with China,\u00a0which cost this country over 4\u00a0million good-paying jobs.\u00a0You voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the Hyde\u00a0amendment, which denies low\u00a0income women the right to get an\u00a0abortion.\u00a0You have consistently voted for\u00a0it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt takes courage sometimes to\u00a0vote and do the right thing.\u201d Biden quickly fired back: \u201cYou can argue about the past. \u2026 This man voted against the Brady\u00a0bill five times.\u00a0Background checks.\u00a0Background checks. Five times.\u201d Biden added: \u201cNumber two, this man is the one of the few Democrats I know\u00a0who voted to exempt the gun\u00a0industry from being able to be\u00a0sued.\u00a0Talk about a special, special\u00a0interest. We should be able to sue drug\u00a0companies.\u00a0We should be able to sue\u00a0tobacco.\u00a0We can't sue gun manufacturers\u00a0because he voted for that years\u00a0ago. He says it was a mistake now. I am prepared to accept he says it was a mistake. The question is what do we do\u00a0from this point on?\u201d ##Biden## ##Sanders## Bernie Sanders laid into Joe Biden on tonight for his openness in the past to cutting Social Security, bringing an attack that\u2019s been a fixture in Sanders\u2019 campaign ads into the debate. \u201cI am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate time and time again, touting the need to cut Social Security, Medicare and veterans\u2019 programs,\u201d the Vermont senator said to Biden.\u00a0 \u201cThat is not true,\u201d Biden shot back.\u00a0 Sanders told those watching at home to visit YouTube \u2014 where the first search result for \u201cJoe Biden Social Security\u201d is a video posted by Sanders\u2019 campaign in which Biden says to \u201cput all of it on the table.\u201d\u00a0 Biden said he was willing to put changes to Social Security on the table \u201cin order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBut we did not cut it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI know,\u201d Sanders shot back, \u201cbecause people like me helped stop that.\u201d Watch:  ##Biden## ##Sanders## Joe Biden fired back at Bernie Sanders' implication that millionaires and billionaires have too much influence in campaigns, including the former vice president\u2019s bid, by arguing he beat Sanders with less money in recent primaries and caucuses. \u201cYou need to take on Wall Street.\u00a0You need to take on the drug\u00a0companies and the insurance companies and\u00a0the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou don't take campaign\u00a0contributions from them.\u00a0You take them on and create an\u00a0economy that works for all.\u201d Biden fired back by calling for federal funded elections with \u201cno private contributions\u201d in the election process. But then the former vice president hit Sanders for the implication, noting that money in election doesn\u2019t always mean winning. \u201cBernie\u2019s implication is somehow I am being funded by millionaires,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIn the last Super Tuesday and\u00a0before that, Bernie outspent me\u00a02, 3, 4, 5, 6 to 1 and I still won.\u00a0I didn't have any money.\u00a0And I still won.\u201d Biden won contests over the last two weeks despite spending millions less than Sanders on television, digital and radio ads. Watch: ##Sanders## ##Biden## Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders delivered nearly identical answers when asked what precautions they are taking during the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Sanders, 78, said his campaign has called off rallies, which he said he enjoys doing, and instead did a \u201cfireside chat\u201d Saturday night, referring to an online event his campaign held. Biden, 77, also said his campaign is no longer holding rallies and instead doing virtual town halls, the first of which came Friday night.\u00a0 Both said they are washing their hands and using hand sanitizer frequently.\u00a0 The two also said they are no longer shaking hands. They greeted each other with an elbow bump in CNN\u2019s Washington studios ahead of tonight\u2019s debate.\u00a0 Biden also noted that he has no underlying health conditions. Sanders late last year had a heart attack, but said he is now in good health. Watch: ##Sanders## ##Biden## ##Coronavirus## Joe Biden, in response to an exchange about how economic inequality factors into the current spread of coronavirus, said that while there are \u201clegitimate concern about income\u00a0inequality in America,\u201d most Americans are \u201clooking for\u00a0results, not a revolution.\u201d Bernie Sanders followed up by saying that it is \u201cnot good enough not to\u00a0be understanding how we got here\u00a0and where we want to go into the\u00a0future.\u201d The back-and-forth highlighted the key differences between the two candidates: Biden is proposing more traditional leadership, while Sanders is offering more wholesale change, even in the face of a crisis. \u201cPeople are looking for\u00a0results, not a revolution.\u00a0They want to deal with the results they need right now,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cAnd we can do that by making\u00a0sure that we make everybody whole who\u00a0has been so badly hurt\u201d by the economic implications of the coronavirus. Biden pointed to people who have lost jobs, struggled to care for their children and were impacted by health care costs in the face of the coronavirus. \u201cWe can make them whole,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNow.\u201d \u201cThat has nothing to do with the\u00a0legitimate concern about income\u00a0inequality in America. That's real,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that does not affect the\u00a0need for us to act swiftly and\u00a0very thoroughly and in concert\u00a0with all the forces that we need\u00a0to bring to bear to deal with\u00a0the crisis now.\u201d Sanders responded by saying that \u201cit goes without\u00a0saying that as a nation we have\u00a0to respond as forcefully as we\u00a0can to the current crisis.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d Sanders added, \u201cit is not good enough not to\u00a0be understanding how we got here\u00a0and where we want to go into the\u00a0future.\u201d \u201cIn fact, it was my idea originally to\u00a0make sure every person in this\u00a0country is made whole as a\u00a0result of this crisis,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cGod willing, this crisis is going\u00a0to end.\u00a0We're going to have to develop\u00a0an economy in which half of our\u00a0people are not living paycheck\u00a0to paycheck and struggling to\u00a0put food on the table.\u201d Watch: ##Biden## ##Sanders## Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would not deport any undocumented person who came forward for coronavirus treatment or testing. \"Anyone who shows up to be\u00a0tested for coronavirus or gets\u00a0coronavirus and is treated would\u00a0be held harmless,\" he said. He said that there are certain things undocumented immigrants cannot be deported for, and added \"that would be one of them.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders also answered, and mentioned that his Medicare for All plan includes heath care coverage for undocumented immigrants. \"So we have to make sure that\u00a0everybody feels comfortable\u00a0getting the health care that\u00a0they need.\u00a0That should be a general\u00a0principle above and beyond the\u00a0coronavirus,\" he said. Watch: ##Biden## ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Bernie Sanders suggested that the United States should be working with China on dealing with coronavirus. CNN's Dana Bash asked: \"When the outbreak first started,\u00a0the government censored the\u00a0whistleblower doctor who sounded\u00a0the alarm and downplayed the\u00a0true gravity of the the virus.\u00a0What consequences should\u00a0China\u00a0face for its role in this global\u00a0crisis?\" Sanders said one of the consequences to learn is \"you cannot\u00a0lie to the American people.\u00a0You cannot be less than frank\u00a0about the a nature of the crisis.\" He went on say that he doesn't think it's the time to be punishing people. \"Now is the time to be working\u00a0with\u00a0China.\u00a0They are learning a lot about\u00a0this crisis.\u00a0And in fact, we have to work\u00a0with them.\u00a0We have to work with the World\u00a0Health Organization, we have to\u00a0work with Italy.\u00a0If there was ever a moment when\u00a0the entire world is in this\u00a0together, got to support each\u00a0other, this is that moment,\" Sanders said. Watch: ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Joe Biden pointed out another area of agreement with Bernie Sanders during Sunday night's debate: Those on Wall Street responsible for the 2008 economic collapse should have gone to jail.  But he also criticized Sanders over his vote against the bank bailout.\u00a0 The former vice president said individuals Sanders says he cares about would have been in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d had banks been allowed to collapse.\u00a0 \u201cThis was about saving the economy. And it did save the economy. And the banks paid back, and they paid back with interest,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 Then he added: \u201cI agreed with Bernie, someone should have gone to jail.\u201d\u00a0 It was the second time in the debate\u2019s first half-hour that he said he agreed with Sanders. The first was over surging efforts at hospitals to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Watch: ##Biden## ##Sanders## Joe Biden said having Medicare for All in the United States would not help solve the coronavirus crisis.\u00a0 \u201cWith all due respect to\u00a0Medicare for All, you have a\u00a0single payer system in Italy.\u00a0It doesn't work there.\u00a0It has nothing to do with\u00a0Medicare for All.\u00a0That would not solve the problem\u00a0at all,\u201d Biden said. Italy has been put under total lockdown as coronavirus spreads in the country.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders, who has spearheaded Medicare for All, responded to Biden\u2019s assertion and said experts have said that one of the reasons the US has been unprepared to handle this crisis is \"we don't have a\u00a0system.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve got thousands of private\u00a0insurance plans,\" Sanders said. \"That is not a system that is\u00a0prepared to provide health care\u00a0to all people.\u00a0In a good year, without the\u00a0epidemic, we're losing up to\u00a060,000 people who die every year\u00a0because they don't get to a\u00a0doctor on time.\"\u00a0 \u201cIt's clear this crisis is only\u00a0making a bad situation worse,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 Under Sanders' Medicare for All plan, Americans would be enrolled in a national health insurance program, also known as a \"single-payer\" system, and the federal government would run the program.\u00a0 Watch: ##Sanders## ##Biden## ##Coronavirus## Asked if he'd deploy the US military to fight the coronavirus outbreak, Bernie Sanders said he'd use \"all of the\u00a0tools that make sense.\" \"And if using the National Guard \u2014\u00a0which is folks, I think, in New\u00a0York state are already using the\u00a0National Guard \u2014 that's something\u00a0that has to be done,\" Sanders said.\u00a0\"This is clearly, as the vice\u00a0president indicated, a national\u00a0emergency.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden said he'd call on the military immediately, adding they could help build hospitals. \"I would call out the\u00a0military.\u00a0Now,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"So it is a national emergency.\u00a0I would call out the military.\" Watch: ##Biden## ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Joe Biden compared the coronavirus pandemic to war, portraying himself as a leader who is prepared to tackle a crisis and contrasting his approach with Bernie Sanders\u2019 call for a single-payer health care system tonight.\u00a0 \u201cThis is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 \u201cEverything that you need in terms of dealing with this crisis would be free,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is paid for by the taxpayers generally. Generally. It has nothing to do with Bernie\u2019s Medicare for All.\u201d\u00a0 Watch: ##Biden## ##Coronavirus## Joe Biden looked for commonality early in tonight's Democratic debate, saying \u201cI agree with Bernie\u201d on how to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Biden said he and the Vermont senator were on the same page about making sure hospitals are prepared for a surge in sick patients.  \u201cI agree with Bernie. We\u2019re in a situation where we have to now be providing for the hospitals that are going to be needed. We need it now,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Biden said the United States has dealt with similar viruses before, citing \u201cN1H1,\u201d a reference to 2009\u2019s H1N1 pandemic, and \u201cwhat happened in Africa\u201d -- a reference to Ebola.\u00a0 Watch: ##Biden## ##Coronavirus## Bernie Sanders said tonight that the first step to tackling the spread of coronavirus \u2014 whether he becomes president or not \u2014 would be to \u201cshut this\u00a0President up right now.\u201d \u201cFirst thing we have got to do, whether or not I\u2019m\u00a0president, is to shut this President up right now, because he\u2019s undermining the\u00a0doctors and the scientists who\u00a0are trying to help the American\u00a0people,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt is unacceptable for him to be\u00a0blabbering with un-factual\u00a0information, which if confusing the general public.\u201d Democrats have faulted President Trump\u2019s response to coronavirus, blaming him for downplaying the impact the virus may have while his scientific advisers have outlined the widespread implications the virus could have on life in America. Sanders said he believes the government needs to move \u201caggressive\u201d to make sure everybody in this country \u201cunderstands that when\u00a0they get sick with the\u00a0coronavirus \u2026 that all payments will be made.\u201d \u201cThey don't have to worry about\u00a0coming up with money for testing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't have to worry about\u00a0coming up with money for\u00a0treatment.\u201d He added: \u201cDo not worry about the cost\u00a0right now.\u00a0Because we're in the middle of a\u00a0national emergency.\" Watch: ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Joe Biden got the first question of the night \u2014 and it was about the coronavirus outbreak. \"What do you say to the American\u00a0people who are confronting this\u00a0new reality?\" CNN's Jake Tapper asked him. \"This is bigger than any one of\u00a0us.\u00a0This calls for a national rallying to\u00a0everybody move together,\" Biden said. Biden added that he wants to increase testing, and ensure that every state has access to drive-through tests. He said he's working to ensure there are more hospital beds and said he'd deal with the economic fall out \"quickly.\" Watch: ##Biden## ##Coronavirus## Tonight's Democratic debate \u2014 the first one-on-one debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 just kicked off.  This is the last debate before Tuesday's primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. You might notice the podiums are far apart: The microphones at the Democratic debate are 6 feet apart, per recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid the spread of coronavirus. The debate was originally scheduled to be held in Arizona in front of an audience, but was moved to studios in CNN\u2019s Washington, DC, bureau. There is no studio audience tonight. ##Biden## ##Sanders## Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders bumped elbows before the start of tonight\u2019s CNN debate. The candidates appeared to dispense with the traditional pre-debate handshake. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines suggest you should avoid handshakes to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Watch: ##Biden## ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Joe Biden\u00a0and\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0enter their first one-on-one debate tonight under unprecedented circumstances. The debate will be held in\u00a0CNN's studios in Washington, DC,\u00a0with no in-person audience as a result of the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.  The historic situation will serve as the backdrop to a debate in which Biden and Sanders will look to explain how they would lead the country in a moment of crisis and how their experience and policies make them best suited for the job. Here are three things to watch in tonight's debate: Addressing a pandemic: Biden and Sanders' responses to the coronavirus have highlighted their unity in opposing President Trump, as both believe he has mishandled this crisis. But their responses have also highlighted the chasm between the two on policy and demeanor. Biden is pledging competency that leads voters to harken back to how former presidents responded in a time of crisis, while Sanders is promising wholesale change.\nHow will Biden balance a primary and a pivot? The former vice president is eager to pivot to the general election and focus on taking on Trump. But he can't take a potential victory over Sanders for granted and he also can't risk alienating Sanders' supporters. In a speech Tuesday night in Delaware, after his victory in Michigan and other primaries, Biden extended an olive branch to Sanders supporters. Whether Biden can continue that outreach while facing criticism from Sanders on the debate stage tonight is a key question.\nWill Sanders pull his punches? How aggressive Sanders is with Biden could preview how long this primary battle will last. Sanders comes into the debate with a substantial delegate deficit and a slate of tough contests ahead of him on Tuesday. As a results of the coronavirus pandemic, his campaign is currently unable to hold the large, raucous rallies that have propelled his bid to date. That leaves Sunday's debate as the best opportunity for the Vermont senator to make up ground. But how Sanders approaches Biden tonight will set the tone for to the rest of the primary. ##Biden## ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Tom Perez, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said tonight's debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders \"calls for\u00a0clear, compassionate leadership\" in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. \"This is a leadership moment. This is a moment that calls for\u00a0clear, compassionate leadership.\u00a0Leadership that is not afraid of\u00a0facts.\u00a0Leadership that will enable the\u00a0American people to see that our\u00a0Democratic candidates are truly\u00a0able to meet the moment,\" he said. Perez continued: \"This is a serious and somber\u00a0time.\u00a0We all know that.\u00a0Our lives are offended in ways\u00a0that we did not imagine and\u00a0frankly frustratingly are self\u00a0preventable because we have a President who didn't\u00a0prepare for this.\u00a0And so that's what we are going\u00a0to see tonight.\u00a0I think it will be more somber.\" The DNC chair went on to say that he thinks the candidates will talk about the need for Americans to come together. \"There will be disagreements here\u00a0and there.\u00a0I think what you will see more\u00a0than anything are two leaders\u00a0who are exuding that leadership,\" he said. Tonight's debate comes ahead of primaries Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. What we know: Bernie Sanders lost those four states to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden's campaign is looking to score big victories in those states as he continues his march toward the Democratic presidential nomination. ##Sanders## ##Biden## The podiums at tonight's Democratic debate are 6 feet apart per recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid the spread of coronavirus. The debate was moved from Arizona to studios in CNN\u2019s Washington, DC, bureau. The CDC is urging people to practice social distancing to combat the spread of the virus.  Here's a look at the debate stage: To make the March 15 debate stage, candidates needed to have been allocated at least 20% of the total number of pledged delegates allocated across all of the following contests:  Alabama, American Samoa, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Democrats Abroad, Guam, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Vermont and Washington. The allocations need to have been made by by 9 a.m. ET today. The total delegate allocation was determined by adding together all of the delegates allocated to candidates by CNN or the Associated Press, according to the Democratic National Committee. The number of delegates needed to qualify for the debate was determined by multiplying the total delegate allocation by 0.20 and rounding the result to the nearest whole number. The candidates' delegate percentage was calculated by dividing the number of pledged delegates allocated to them by CNN or AP by the total delegate allocation and rounding the result to the nearest whole number. Who didn't make the debate stage: Hawaii Rep.\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard, the only other Democratic candidate still running for president, did not qualify for the debate stage. Gabbard has won a total of two delegates from the nominating contests. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, tonight's Democratic debate will have no audience, and in accordance with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, their podiums will be 6 feet apart.\u00a0 The debate was originally supposed to take place in Arizona in front of a live crowd, but it was moved to CNN's Washington, DC, studios\u00a0last week. \"Out of an abundance of caution and in order to reduce cross-country travel, all parties have decided that the best path forward is to hold Sunday's debate at CNN's studio in Washington, D.C., with no live audience,\" Xochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. Additionally, Univision's Jorge Ramos was possibly exposed to coronavirus. While he is not exhibiting any symptoms, he has stepped down from his role as\u00a0one of the moderators\u00a0for the debate, the DNC said. The network's Ilia Calder\u00f3n will take his place, alongside CNN's Dana Bash and Jake Tapper.  \"Both Mr. Ramos and the person he was in contact with are in good health and symptom free,\" Hinojosa said. \"Despite being cleared by medical professionals and out of an abundance of caution, Jorge has decided to step aside from participating in the upcoming March 15 Democratic debate.\" The\u00a0coronavirus pandemic has also led both candidates to cancel rallies and stay off the campaign trail in recent days. ##Biden## ##Sanders## ##Coronavirus## Former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0will face off Sunday night in the first one-on-one debate of the 2020 presidential primary.
