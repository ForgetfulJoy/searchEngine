Casa Barragan: The Mexico City home of architect Luis Barragan is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a place where interior photos are strictly controlled. Sistine Chapel: The photo ban at the Vatican stems from a copyright deal with a Japanese television station, not  overtourism. Still, the ban is unevenly enforced and social media is filled with plenty of tourist photos. Gion, Kyoto: Residents of this historic neighborhood in Kyoto have voted to ban photos. The area is home to many geisha who have been bothered by snap happy tourists. Sunset Tower Hotel: This iconic Los Angeles hotel asks guests not to snap photos inside, which its many celebrity visitors likely appreciate. Casa Azul: Frida Kahlo's home-turned-museum in Mexico City has found a compromise by charging tourists extra if they want to take snapshots. Van Gogh Museum: Amsterdam's popular attraction only allows photos at a few designated sites, a measure that curbs overcrowding and allows visitors to enjoy the art in peace."], "Language": false}
