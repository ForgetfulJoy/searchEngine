No one was seriously injured, but residents are still wary, given that it's the 11th quake of at least that size to affect the island in the last 30 days.\u00a0\u00a0 Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.  (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. State of the Union State of the Union addresses aren't usually known for their drama and showmanship. That is, unless you're talking about President Trump's address last night, which was essentially a reelection speech punctuated by loaded partisan moments. The President went through a laundry list of what he considers\u00a0recent political wins, including the\u00a0US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that\u00a0replaces NAFTA\u00a0and the assassination of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. Trump\u00a0awarded conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and even orchestrated a surprise military family reunion. Things got a little ugly when Trump appeared to avoid a handshake from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Pelosi later appeared to rip up the President's speech as he concluded to applause. Analysts agree that despite the obviously partisan bent\u00a0of his speech -- and some factual inaccuracies -- Democrats will have a hard time stopping his momentum. After all, with the debacle in Iowa\u00a0and the President less than a day away from a likely impeachment acquittal, it's no doubt Trump has the political upper hand right now.\u00a0 2. Iowa caucuses A majority of the results are in after a daylong vote-reporting debacle in the Iowa Democratic caucuses. Pete Buttigieg holds a lead over Bernie Sanders, and both hold a commanding margin\u00a0over the rest of the pack: Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar, respectively. While Buttigieg\u00a0claimed victory in the pivotal contest, this year's caucus results\u00a0reveal a fragmentation among Democratic voters\u00a0and have done little to separate the field of top candidates. That being said, underperforming candidates, like Biden, have a lot to sort through as the primary season continues. The problems with the\u00a0Iowa Democratic Party's systems that led to the vote-reporting delay also gave a prime opening for Republicans to criticize their opponents for disorganization and lack of direction.\u00a0 3. Coronavirus\u00a0 The number of people who have died from the Wuhan coronavirus is nearing 500, and nearly 25,000 have been infected, but the World Health Organization is stopping short of classifying the outbreak as a pandemic. The WHO says its experts are hopeful the virus can be contained, despite its communicable nature and the mass travel of people around the globe. To that end, countries continue\u00a0to impose quarantines on citizens\u00a0and tourists who may have come in contact with the disease. Around 3,700 people are being held on a Diamond Princess Cruise ship in Japanese waters after authorities discovered that a passenger who departed the vessel tested positive for coronavirus. 4. Mexico violence At least nine people, including four children, were killed and several others wounded in a shooting at a video arcade in\u00a0Uruapan, in the western Mexican state\u00a0of Michoac\u00e1n. Urapan\u00a0has seen episodes of grisly murder linked to drug cartels in the past.\u00a0Michoac\u00e1n is also\u00a0the site of another bizarre episode of violence: Two monarch butterfly conservationists were recently found dead in separate incidents.\u00a0Mexico's State Commission for Human Rights says at least one conservationist may have come in contact with illegal loggers while working\u00a0on the\u00a0Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in a forested area about 60 miles outside Mexico City.\u00a0 5. Russia\u00a0 The US military deployed a new type of nuclear weapon that the Pentagon hopes will be a counter to\u00a0the threat posed by Russia's arsenal of smaller tactical nukes. Like its name implies, the W76-2 low-yield submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead is housed on a submarine, which officials say would cut down on the response time in the event of a conflict in which nuclear force was warranted. These \"low-yield\" nuclear weapons are less powerful than typical nuclear warheads but are easier to transport and deploy. While some in the defense community think updating US\u00a0nuclear weaponry is a smart defense tactic, others say the proliferation of low-yield weapons is just a different type of invitation for nuclear war.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Florida police\u00a0found a bag full of drugs fittingly labeled 'Bag Full of Drugs' Deductive reasoning strikes again!\u00a0\u00a0 Sand dunes can 'communicate' with each other\u00a0and even give neighboring dunes a shove So, sand dunes are gossipy and pushy.
