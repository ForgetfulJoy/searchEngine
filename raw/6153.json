Coronavirus More than half of US states will begin reopening by the end of the week, and President Trump says federal distancing guidelines will begin fading out as restrictions are lifted. But that doesn't mean life is going to immediately return to normal. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom is actually planning to\u00a0 strengthen restrictions by ordering the closure of all state beaches and parks after photos of crowded beaches surfaced last weekend. In Florida, Miami-Dade and two other counties will continue with lockdown restrictions, even as the rest of the state begins to reopen. And if you think your favorite sports team may be back in action soon, think again: Dr. Anthony Fauci says it may be a year before sports return to normal in the US. For a blueprint of life after Covid restrictions, take a look at Wuhan: Though the city has technically opened back up, some businesses are still shut down, and citizens are still hesitant to socialize. Follow the latest news here.\u00a0 2. remdesivir Researchers have good news about a possible Covid-19 treatment. A trial of the experimental drug remdesivir showed it might help patients recover more quickly from the infection. The US Food and Drug Administration plans to announce an emergency-use authorization for the drug as soon as this week. US stocks surged with news of the breakthrough. In Germany, a company working with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has begun human trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine that could supply millions by the end of the year. Pfizer says it could start testing in the US next week, and the vaccine could be ready for emergency use in the fall. \u00a0 3. Economy\u00a0 Think the economy's bad now? It's going to get worse. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the second quarter of the year will bring the worst economic numbers the country has ever seen. The Fed says it will deploy its \"full range of tools\" to support the economy, including keeping rates down and doling out aid. Huge companies like Boeing and GE have posted massive losses in the first quarter. The health care sector has also been hit hard, but not in the way you may think: Overcrowded hospitals and social distancing measures have meant less time and resources for moneymaking elective procedures.\u00a0 4. White House\u00a0 The White House is weathering a series of controversies related to the administration's handling of the coronavirus. President Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner was criticized for calling US response to the virus a \"great success story\" less than a day after confirmed cases in the US topped 1 million. Trump similarly tried to reframe the narrative around the growing number of coronavirus cases and deaths, which has now surpassed the tally of US troop fatalities during the Vietnam War, by saying the high numbers were due to more testing. And Vice President Mike Pence ran into an awkward situation during a visit to the Mayo Clinic, when he appeared without a mask despite being asked by the facility ahead of time to wear one. 5. Iran The US is looking to extend a weapons ban against Iran that is legally set to expire in the fall under the Iran nuclear deal. There's a catch, though: The US withdrew from the agreement in 2018. Still, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the administration will explore ways to prevent the small arms embargo from sunsetting, even if the US doesn't have support from its European allies. Key European participants have pointed out the US hasn't been involved in any meetings related to the nuclear deal since it withdrew, and trying to extend the ban could test already strained diplomatic tensions with Iran.
