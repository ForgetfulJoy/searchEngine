Brenda McNicol baked this chocolate cake for her 60th birthday and then held a virtual party via a video-conferencing app. \"The pandemic has changed our lives dramatically, like everyone else,\" said McNicol, who is from Edmonton, Alberta. \"We are staying home, cooking at home and staying away from our family and friends.\" Eric Cox shows off a ribeye steak that he recently grilled in Tucson, Arizona. He used an espresso dry rub and topped it with garlic, crispy sage, rosemary and garlic chive butter. \"As a full-time artist, this pandemic has drastically impacted how I'm creating.

While staying at home in Washington state, she made this caramel dessert. \"Making the perfect golden caramel looks easy, but it's not (at least for me),\" she said. \"This one turned out beautiful, and I used it to make an Argentinean type of flan that was baked in a water bath for four hours. The density and texture of the dessert turned out delicious.\" James Winston created this lobster ravioli with a burst cherry tomato sauce and basil.

I can't exactly shy away from healthy meals because of my pregnancy, so I often find myself on Facebook groups or Pinterest looking for new meal ideas, and it has been incredibly helpful. And fun in sharing the outcome with family and friends via FaceTime, texts and Facebook!\" These pastries \u2014 Swedish cardamom and cinnamon knots \u2014 were created by Vanessa Ritt in Potsdam, Germany. \"It's very hard to get certain ingredients over here like yeast and flour. so now we're experimenting with making our own yeast from dried fruit water and sugar, which is fun,\" she said. \"And since everyone needs something to lighten them up, we also sometimes give some of the food to our neighbors.\" \"I was running out of ideas for breakfast, so I searched YouTube for 'world's best breakfast recipe.'

Riedel topped it with cilantro and green olives. \"I became more conscious to cook just enough or sometimes less so as to stretch what we have in the house,\" she said. \"We haven't left our house for 10 days now since lockdown, and we don't know when we want to go out to make sure we are safe.\" Stacy Deasy made chicken and dumplings for her family in Wicklow, Ireland. \"Not only is it really flavorful and satisfying to eat, but it's inexpensive, contains basic ingredients and is not completely unhealthy,\" she said. \"Those are the things I've really been thinking about when cooking for my family during these strange days.\" Veronica Jones was inspired by a recent trip to Hawaii when she and her husband, Nate, made Spam musubi.

She said she's tried to keep the fridge stocked with nutritious fresh foods, but it isn't easy these days. So she's had to be creative and work with what she can get. \"Somehow it's not the carrots and the bananas that go first. And that's where this morning pick-me-up came from,\" she said. During the pandemic, many people are turning to comfort food. For Katrina Crandall, that's food from New Mexico, where she grew up. \"I made a healthier, gluten-free, vegetarian version of a burrito, with seasoned ground soy \"beef,\" beans, red chile sauce, spinach, cheddar and avocado. It reminded me of home while allowing me to stick to my nutrition goals,\" she said. \"I think all our food should be packed with flavor right now,\" said Kathy Godley, who lives in County Wicklow in Ireland. \"It's important to return to our senses as a way to minimize stress.

Utah resident McKenna Jo Haws baked this dark-chocolate cake with Irish whiskey. \"The layers are filled with dulce de leche, and it's frosted with hazelnut Swiss meringue buttercream that I folded chocolate chips into,\" she said. \"I topped it with homemade chocolate/dulce de leche macarons.\" She made it because her husband is considered an \"essential\" worker and he wanted to cheer up his co-workers. Suzy Szasz Palmer had leftover cooked salmon, so she made salmon cakes and paired it with a salad. \"I wanted to do something different with leftover salmon other than just put"], "Language": false}
