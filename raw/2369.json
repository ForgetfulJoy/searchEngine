The album, \"Donald Glover Presents,\" features 12 songs, including a few previously released tracks like \"Feels Like Summer\" and \"Algorythm.\"  The album is currently only available on donaldgloverpresents.com, which only shows the album title and cover art. No other information, including song titles, is available. Other artists featured on the album include 21 Savage, Ariana Grande and SZA, Billboard reported.  In 2017, Glover confirmed he was retiring his rapper/singer alter ego, Childish Gambino, though he keeps winning Grammys under the name.  He won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Redbone\" in 2018. \"I stand by that,\" Glover said about dropping the name after his Grammy win in 2018. \"I'm making another project right now ... but I like endings, I think they're important to progress.\" He made Grammy history in February when \"This is America\" won song and record of the year, becoming the first rap song to win the prestigious awards.
