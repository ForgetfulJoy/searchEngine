The staggering extent of the economic pain the United States faces was crystallized in a new round of unemployment data released today: 1 in 5 American workers has filed jobless claims since lockdown measures took effect in mid-March. Every day brings signs that what first looked like temporary job cuts could turn into permanent layoffs. Families are already feeling the effects. Among mothers with young children, almost one-fifth say they're going hungry, according to a survey by the Brookings Institution \u2014 a rate far worse than in 2008, during the global financial crisis.      President Donald Trump has made clear that the economic cost of the national lockdown has grown too steep, despite projections that many more will die as the US reopens. \"We have to be warriors,\" Trump said yesterday. \"We can't keep our country closed down for years.\" And while he reversed a decision to phase out the coronavirus task force, it will now be pivoted to focus on reopening the nation. The bleak financial picture looks much the same across the pond. As Europe begins to open back up, Brussels warns the eurozone faces an existential threat if the economies of member states do not recover evenly. The UK is headed for the worst crash in more than 300 years, according to the Bank of England, which said the country's economy could contract by 14% this year.   The calculations are a bleak reminder that the fallout from the crisis could cripple the world's economy for months, and likely years, to come.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY US stockpile no match for pandemic As complaints about dire shortages of protective gear for medical workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 crisis began to stream in, President Donald Trump was quick to point the finger of blame at his predecessor, Barack Obama. To an extent, the President was right. The Obama administration used and then failed to replace items from the nation's Strategic National Stockpile to fight the 2009 H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic. But Trump hadn't replaced those items either, despite repeated warnings that the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic, stockpile experts said.    The British government is facing similar criticisms that vital items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were missing from the UK's national stockpile. To shore up supplies, the government ordered around 400,000 surgical gowns from a Turkish company in mid-April. But the gowns were never distributed among health workers because they did not meet safety standards.  First ICE detainee dies from coronavirus A 57-year-old man from El Salvador became the first person to die from coronavirus while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, a senior US immigration official told CNN.    Reports of the man's death drew swift condemnation from immigrant rights organizations, who've been pushing for weeks for ICE to release more detainees from its facilities and warning that the Trump administration is using the pandemic to push its aggressive immigration agenda. The US has continued to deport thousands of people during the outbreak \u2014 including some who are sick.    Sports return to US On Saturday, the UFC is scheduled to become the first sport in the US to return to action, with the organization's president acutely aware of the increased scrutiny that's inevitably coming his way. All eyes are on Dana White and his Ultimate Fighting Championship, with three fight nights planned in the space of eight days in May. And the stakes simply could not be higher. \"Listen, we have families, too,\" White told CNN Sport. \"I don't want to die.\"   Germany's success story Behind Germany's success in bringing the virus to heel is Angela Merkel. The German Chancellor, who has a PhD in quantum chemistry, has made a remarkable turnaround since the start of the year \u2014 when she was relegated to the sidelines as a lame duck leader. Now she is a beacon of global leadership, Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 writes.    Yesterday, the Chancellor unveiled plans for the partial lifting of Germany's lockdown, allowing shops to reopen and people to meet in small groups. \"The first phase of the pandemic is behind us but we are still at the beginning and it will be with us for a long time,\" Merkel said. 57,000 people are still stuck on cruise ships Most cruise passengers have made their way back home, and the vast ships that once ferried them from port to port are moored up or back on the water, relocating for the next stage in their journeys. But what about the crews that kept these gigantic vessels going, and looked after guests as panic over the coronavirus swept across the oceans?    Brazil sees record daily deaths Brazil, the hardest hit country in Latin America, registered a record number of cases and deaths yesterday, forcing the health minister to raise the possibility of strict lockdowns in hotspots.     The spokesman for President Jair Bolsonaro has become the latest government official to test positive for the disease.

Meanwhile, in Ibiza, Covid-19 has crashed that party.   \nAt least eight people in India have been killed by a toxic gas leak at a chemical plant which was reopening after the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures.  \nThis is supposed to be a busy time for Bollywood.
