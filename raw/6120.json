Alignment of the ATP and WTA has been discussed on and off for years but might be closer than ever following Federer -- arguably the most popular player in tennis history -- asking on April 22, \"Just wondering...am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men's and women's tennis to be united and come together as one?\" The men's record 20-time grand slam winner immediately got support from friend and 19-time major champion Rafael Nadal, with Murray -- another member of tennis' Big Four -- now joining them.   Murray has long been a champion for equality, becoming the first high-profile male player, for instance, to employ a women's coach.  \"I think it's great if more\u00a0of the male players are seeing\u00a0it as a positive step for the\u00a0sport,\" Murray told CNN's Christiane Amanpour as she interviewed the three-time grand slam winner and trailblazer Billie Jean King.  \"I think we have a very unique\u00a0sport in that we have the men\u00a0and the women competing at the\u00a0biggest competitions together.\u00a0That doesn't really happen in\u00a0any of the other global sports\u00a0and I see that as a big positive.\u00a0We have equal prize money at the\u00a0events which I think is\u00a0fantastic and very attractive to\u00a0sponsors, to the audience.\u00a0 \"We have pretty much a 50/50 kind\u00a0of audience split between men\u00a0and women which again is rare\u00a0across sports and I think all of\u00a0these things are things that we\u00a0should be celebrating in the\u00a0sport.  \"Sometimes\u00a0they aren't and there's a lot of\u00a0in-fighting that goes on with\u00a0these things and I don't think\u00a0that should be the case.\u00a0There's obviously going to be\u00a0some issues potentially with a\u00a0merger, as well, but\u00a0it is definitely I think a step\u00a0in the right direction to start\u00a0these conversations.\" It was King who sought to come together with the men\u00a0nearly 50 years ago, which Murray was quick to point out. But when the men declined, King founded the WTA tour.  She was \"thrilled\" with Federer's public declaration because \"when top male players\u00a0bring it up, people listen.\" The 76-year-old American has spoken with the Swiss, who is part of the ATP's player council alongside Nadal and, among others, the other Big Four member, Novak Djokovic.  The lone prominent player to publicly go against the idea has been Murray's friend, the sometimes controversial Nick Kyrgios.  More leverage \"We can grow,\" said King. \"But what we have to understand\u00a0is we have to stay together as a\u00a0sport, because we're not competing\u00a0within our sport like a lot of\u00a0tennis people think.\u00a0We need to compete against the\u00a0other entertainment and other\u00a0sports.\u00a0 \"I don't think people realize we are in this\u00a0business.\u00a0And so I think it's very\u00a0important that we are together,\u00a0that we're not an acquisition.\u00a0The WTA would not be an\u00a0acquisition.\u00a0We would be a full partner in\u00a0this drive to make our sport\u00a0better and more valuable.\u00a0 \"Can you imagine how strong we\u00a0could be if we negotiate as one\u00a0voice?\u00a0Ka-ching.\" Indeed, a combined tour would presumably strengthen the bargaining position of players at a time when they are seeking a larger piece of tennis' revenue, particularly for lower-ranked players and at grand slams. \u00a0 The current suspension of the tours due to the virus has given the ATP and WTA more time to discuss matters than ever before, while new ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi seems intent on collaborating with the WTA.  \"Recent cooperation between governing bodies has only strengthened my belief that a unified sport is the surest way to maximize our potential and to deliver an optimal experience for fans on-site, on television and online,\" Gaudenzi said in a statement sent to CNN last month.  He stopped short at this stage, though, of calling for a formal merger.  WTA chairman and CEO Steve Simon added in a statement: \"I have long stated that we are at our best as a sport when we can work together, and the recent weeks have highlighted that fact.\" He has always been a fan, for example, of mixed events. But while Murray, Nadal and Federer are on board, the Scot revealed that some of his ATP peers haven't been keen on gender equality.  Some male players unhappy The 32-year-old said in the past when there have been prize money increases for both men and women -- and women made the same amount as the men -- some of his fellow players objected. \"I spoke to some of the male players about that who were unhappy because the prize money was equal,\" he said. \"And I said, 'Well, would you rather there was no increase at all? You know?' They said to me, 'Yeah, actually.' \"That's some of the sort of the\u00a0mentalities you are working with\u00a0in these discussions where\u00a0someone would rather make less\u00a0money so they're not on an equal\u00a0footing with some of the female\u00a0players, so there will be some\u00a0challenges.\" He said it was imperative for more women to be involved in the decision-making process.  \"Coming to this sort of key\u00a0decision makers right now in\u00a0tennis, pretty much all of them\u00a0are men and I think that when\u00a0these discussions happen it's\u00a0quite important not just to see\u00a0this merger through a man's\u00a0eyes and to bring more women\u00a0into the decision making\u00a0positions so that everybody's\u00a0voice gets heard and protected\u00a0in the discussions,\" said Murray.  \"And if that\u00a0happens we have huge potential\u00a0as a sport to -- I already think\u00a0it's a very special sport\u00a0because of what we already have\u00a0-- (make it) even\u00a0better.\" Visit our tennis page for more news and videos Pro tennis won't return until July 13 at the earliest, following the cancelation of Wimbledon, though several exhibition series' are starting.
