Here are the winners and losers from tonight's debate: Winners: Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg Losers: Joe Biden, Tom Steyer Read Cillizza's take on tonight's debate here. After more than two hours spent discussing topics like the impeachment inquiry and climate change, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg spoke the most at tonight's debate. Watch a minute-by-minute breakdown of where each candidate ranked: In response to a question about child care\u00a0costs tonight,\u00a0businessman Andrew Yang\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cThere\u00a0are only two countries in the world that don\u2019t have paid family leave for new moms:\u00a0the\u00a0United States of America and Papua New Guinea.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0It\u2019s true that America ranks behind\u00a0all\u00a0other major developed nations when it comes to statutory paid family leave. But Yang\u2019s claim that only the US and Papua New Guinea offer no paid family leave\u00a0appears to be\u00a0based on a report that is more than five years old.\u00a0 The United States is the only member of the\u00a0Organisation\u00a0for Economic Co-Operation and Development that doesn\u2019t offer statutory paid family leave, according to a report from August 2019.\u00a0 A\u00a0May 2014 report by the International Labor Organization\u00a0showed that out of 185 countries and territories that share information on parental leave, only Papua New Guinea and the United States \u201chave no general legal provision for cash benefits.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 The Yang campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its sources.\u00a0\u00a0 In a heated exchange, California Sen. Kamala Harris said Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u201cduring the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News\u201d criticizing President Barack\u00a0Obama.\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0Harris\u2019 characterization is misleading.\u00a0Gabbard\u00a0did appear on Fox News during the Obama administration, and often criticized the administration\u2019s Middle East policy. But she has appeared much more frequently on Fox News since President Trump took office. Gabbard appeared on Fox News at least 15 times between January 2013, when she first took office, and January 2017 when Obama left office. She often criticized the Obama administration but primarily in the context of Middle East policy. By comparison,\u00a0Gabbard has appeared on Fox News\u00a0far\u00a0more frequently during the Trump administration, and since she announced her presidential campaign \u2013 appearing at least 15 times in 2019 alone. The fifth Democratic presidential debate has just wrapped up with each candidate making their closing case to be the party's nominee. Here are some of the key lines from their closing statements: Cory Booker:  \"We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells with freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us.\"\nTom Steyer: \"If you want to pass all the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants, then I am the person who can do it.\"\nTulsi Gabbard: \"Working side by side, let's defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump, come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace, inclusion and true equality.\" \nAndrew Yang: \"Our kids are not all right. They're not all right because we're leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents. We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history.\"\nAmy Klobuchar: \"I want us to remember that this election is, yes, an economic check on this President and I have bold ideas that we can do to move forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the cost of healthcare, yes. This is also a patriotism check. A value check. A decency check.\"\nJoe Biden: \"I'm so tired of everybody walking around like, woe is me, what are we going to do. Let's remember, this is the United States of America. There has never ever, ever, been a time where we set our mind to do something we've been unable to do it. Never, never, never. Get up, let's take back our country and lead the world again.\"\nPete Buttigieg: \"I'm not only running to defeat Donald Trump. I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office. To launch the era that must come after Trump. That era must be characterized not by exclusion, but by belonging.\"\nKamala Harris: \"So we're in a fight. This is a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy and for our system of justice, and it's a fight we need to win. And to fight this fight, I believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump...I know I have the ability to do that.\"\nBernie Sanders: \"I will lead an administration that will look like America. We'll end the divisiveness by Trump and bring us together.\"\nElizabeth Warren: \"We have to have the courage not to just make individual changes, not to fight for little pieces. We want to make real progress on climate, then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country.\" The final count is in, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the group with more than 13 minutes in speaking time. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had more than 12 minutes, came in second.  See the\u00a0full breakdown: Pete Buttigieg defend his level of experience on Wednesday in contentious exchanges with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, using the debate to argue \u201cWashington experience is not the only experience that matters.\u201d The most contentious point of Buttigieg\u2019s defense came when the mayor said, \u201cThere\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s experience \u2013 he leads a city of just over 100,000 people, has only ever been elected by a few voters thousand and lost his only statewide election \u2013 has been a central question about his candidacy. And it was clear on Wednesday that his competitors came into the debate looking to questions his qualifications. When Buttigieg mentioned voting rights, Klobuchar jumped in and said the issue is a \u201cgood example of where (Buttigieg) has said the right words\u201d but not followed it up with action and called the mayor a \u201clocal official.\u201d \u201cI have actually done this work,\u201d Klobuchar said. Buttigieg fired back. \u201cWashington experience is not the only experience that matters,\u201d he said, nodding not only his time as mayor, but his experience as a war veteran. \u201cI would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late,\u201d Buttigieg said. Then Gabbard jumped and said Buttigieg showed a lack of judgment when he suggested using the U.S. military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation. \u201cThat is outlandish, even by the standards of today\u2019s politics, Buttigieg responded. \u201cDo you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? \u2026 I\u2019m talking about building alliances.\u201d The mayor then hit Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \u201cLet\u2019s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad,\u201d Buttigieg said. Gabbard responded by noting how past leaders met with opposing leaders, citing when President John F. Kennedy met with Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev and former President Franklin Roosevelt met with Russian leader Joseph Stalin. Buttigieg interrupted, \u201cLike Donald Trump who met with Kim,\u201d a nod to North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he was endorsed by the only African American woman ever elected to the Senate, leading California Sen. Kamala Harris, his 2020 rival and the second black woman elected to the Senate, to laugh and point out that Biden was wrong. Biden appeared to be referring to former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, the first black woman elected to the Senate -- though not the only one. Moseley Braun is a strong Biden supporter. \"I said the first,\" Biden said as Harris reacted.  South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg acknowledged the most existential threat to his candidacy at Wednesday\u2019s debate \u2013 his lack of African American support \u2013 and accepted implicit criticism by California Sen. Kamala Harris by saying he agrees with her views on the importance of black voters. Buttigieg\u2019s lack of black support, especially in South Carolina, has been a critical issue for the mayor of South Bend and something he has been trying to address for months. But his work has done little and a recent poll in the southern state \u2013 where the Democratic primary electorate is expected to be heavily African American \u2013 found he has 0% support. Harris, in response to question about past comments she made about Buttigieg\u2019s support, said that her answer came in response to the Buttigieg campaign using a stock photo that was taken in Kenya as an image related to his plan aimed at racial equality on a host of issues. The Buttigieg campaign apologized for using the photo, but said they were not aware the photo was taken in Kenya when it was used. Harris didn\u2019t focus on the photo issue very long \u2013 \u201cI believe the mayor has made apologies for that,\u201d she said \u2013 and instead turned to the importance of black voters in an implicit criticism of the mayor. \u201cThe larger issue is that for too long candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and has overlooked those constituencies,\u201d she said. When the conversation turned to Buttigieg, the mayor said, \u201cI completely agree.\u201d \u201cAnd I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don\u2019t yet know me,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd before I share what\u2019s in my plans, let me talk about what\u2019s in my heart and why this is so important.\u201d Buttigieg went on to talk about his time as mayor of South Bend, a city that is over a quarter black, and his faith. \u201cI care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society,\" he said. But he closed out the answer by talking about his sexuality: \u201cWhile I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking it possible for me to be standing here, wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn\u2019t have happened two elections ago, lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.\u201d We are two hours into tonight's Democratic debate, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren is still out front with the most speaking time so far. Here's the full rundown of how much everyone has spoken as of 11 p.m. ET: Follow our\u00a0live graphic\u00a0for the latest figures. Former Vice President Joe Biden continued to face criticism tonight from his 2020 rivals for his stance on the legalization of marijuana. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker went after Biden's recent remarks at a town hall in Las Vegas, where he said he still opposes\u00a0legalizing marijuana\u00a0on the federal level and told attendees that he wants to see more study on whether it is a \"gateway drug.\" \"I thought you might have been high when you said that,\" Booker told Biden. The remark drew laughter from the audience. Biden went on to defend his position, saying he thinks marijuana should be decriminalized. \"Anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged and be completely zeroed out, but I do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana,\" he said. During a discussion on sexual violence and harassment against women in the US, former Vice President Joe Biden explained that the US needs to change its culture. \"No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense and that rarely ever occurs. So we have to just change the culture. Period. And we have to keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it. I really mean it. It's a gigantic issue,\" Biden said. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders drew a bright line between his and former Vice President Joe Biden's foreign policy views, pointing to his opposition to both of America\u2019s wars in Iraq. \"One of the big differences between the Vice President and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War.\u201d Sanders pushed further, saying as he so often does on the trail, that \u201cwe need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are\u201d and \u201cthat we don't have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined.\u201d He responded to the initial question, which asked whether he would negotiate with the Taliban as a means of ending the war in Afghanistan, with a pledge to work with allies to do whatever it takes to stop the conflict. \u201cI will (end the war there) by working with the international community,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cand, if it's necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, then of course we will do that.\u201d But, given the current administration\u2019s recent actions to pull troops out of Syria without warning, Sanders also said he would take a different approach to the process. \u201cUnlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at 3 o'clock in the morning,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI will do it working with the international community. Sanders also took a step away from the party establishment consensus by calling out Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians in Gaza. \u201cIt is no longer good enough for us simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity they deserve,\" to applause from the debate hall. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the US has a health care system \u201cin which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is not true.\u00a0The US spent twice as much per capita on health care last year than the average for Organisation\u00a0for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries,\u00a0but not twice as much as every single one of the organization\u2019s 35 other members. At $10,586 per capita in 2018, US spending was well over twice the\u00a0OECD average\u00a0($3,992) and well over twice the figures for some other major countries, including Canada ($4,974). But Switzerland ($7,317), Norway ($6,187) and Germany ($5,986) were all substantially above half the US level. Sweden ($5,447), Austria ($5,395)\u00a0and Denmark ($5,299) were also above half, though more slightly.\u00a0\u00a0 Sanders has been repeating this exaggeration since at least 2009, when fact-checkers at PolitiFact first noted that it wasn't true.\u00a0CNN fact-checked him during the Democratic debate in September.\u00a0 We are more than an hour into tonight's Democratic debate, and former Vice President Joe Biden is out front with the most speaking time so far. Here's the full rundown of how much everyone has spoken as of 10:30 p.m. ET: Follow our live graphic for the latest figures. Businessman Andrew\u00a0Yang didn't pull punches when asked about what he would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin during their first call if elected president. \"First I'd say I'm sorry I beat your guy,\" Yang said, to laughs and applause. \"Or not sorry. And second I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over. And we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression.\" Yang added that the Russia had \"made it so that we can't even trust our own democracy.\" California Sen. Kamala Harris went after President Donald Trump on his response to North Korea. Asked whether she'd make concessions to the North Korean leader to keep talks going, Harris said, \"Donald Trump got punked.\" She went on to say that Trump has conducted his foreign policy \"born on a fragile ego.\" Harris listed a series of Trump administration policies that she considered failures, including pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. Harris said Trump is the \"greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.\" South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg slammed President Donald Trump for the ongoing trade war impacting farmers across the country, bluntly stating that he doesn\u2019t believe \u201cthis President cares one bit about farmers.\u201d Buttigieg said he would continue to provide farm subsidies as President, something Trump has done to help farmers deal with the trade war. But he added that he doesn\u2019t believe farmers would need them under his leadership \u201cbecause we are going to fix the trade war.\u201d Buttigieg noted that those payments aren\u2019t \u201ceven making farmers whole\u201d and specifically called out soybean farmers, who he said are getting \u201ckilled\u201d by the tariffs and other factors. The Trump administration, in response to retaliatory tariffs implemented by China on a host of American agriculture products, has begun a series of direct payments to farmers who are struggling to sell their products. Farmers have already received $6.8 billion this year from the trade mitigation package, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The first round of payments was made over the summer and was meant to cover 50% of what farmers are due this year. But Democrats have argued that those payments would not be needed if the President hadn\u2019t started the trade war to begin with. Billionaire businessman Tom Steyer was animated tonight in Atlanta when discussing climate change, a top priority for his presidential campaign and a \"state of emergency.\" \"I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me. It's a state of emergency and I would declare a state of emergency on day one,\" Steyer said to applause. What else Steyer has said about climate change: During his town hall on Nov. 10, he also pledged to demand Congress to pass a version of the Green New Deal during his first 100 days in office. \"I've spent over a decade fighting oil companies and beating them at the ballot box. I've led the charge for clean energy across the country at the ballot box,\" Steyer said. \"I've worked to stop pipelines. I've worked to stop fossil fuel plants. We're talking about the future, but you can look at my history and know that this is something that is an absolutely top priority for me.\" Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard slammed the Democratic Party at Wednesday\u2019s debate, accusing Hillary Clinton and other Democrats of having the same views on war as former President George W. Bush and President Donald Trump. The attack led California Sen. Kamala Harris to hit back at Gabbard, saying that it is \u201cunfortunate that we have someone on this stage that is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for the President of the United States who during the Obama administration has spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama\u201d and \u201cfull-time criticizing people on this stage, affiliated with the Democratic Party.\u201d Gabbard\u2019s answer came in response to a question about Hillary Clinton recently telling an interviewer that the Hawaii congresswoman is being groomed for a third party run and is a \u201cfavorite of the Russians.\u201d Gabbard said on Wednesday that the Democratic Party \u201chas been, and continues to be, influenced by the foreign policy establishment represented by Hillary Clinton.\u201d Harris, among other issues, slammed Gabbard for failing to \u201ccall a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal,\u201d nodding to Gabbard\u2019s past comments about Syrian Leader Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard responded by acknowledging her own military service and saying, \u201cWhat Sen. Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I\u2019m making. \u201cI\u2019m seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive,\u201d Gabbard concluded. Sen. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t render a moral verdict on Democrats who chant \u201cLock him up!\u201d at President Trump, but he did take a stab at what was at the root of the urge. \u201cI think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this President thinks he is above the law,\u201d Sanders said.  \u201cThe American people are saying nobody is above the law,\u201d he said, and that, if Trump committed a crime, \u201che should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law.\u201d But Sanders also rejected the suggestion that country was, as had been suggested by the moderators, near hopelessly divided. \"When you talk about the pain of working families it is not true (that the country is divided),\u201d Sanders said, then ticking off a list of issues where he \u2014 and some polling \u2014 shows signs of a growing consensus. \u201cThe majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage,\u201d he said, before turning to climate change and gun control: \u201cWhen you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real, they know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry, they know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.\u201d \"Even on issues like guns,\u201d Sanders added, \u201cthe American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence.\" We are almost an hour into tonight's Democratic debate, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren is out front with the most speaking time so far. Here's the full rundown of how much everyone has spoken as of 10 p.m. ET. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Wednesday night that women are held to a higher standard after being asked about a recent comment she made that a woman with the same kind of experience as Pete Buttigieg would not do as well as the mayor has done in the primary.  \u201cFirst of all, I have made very clear that I think Pete is qualified to be on this stage and I am honored to be standing next to him,\u201d Klobuchar said, \u201cbut what I said was true: Women are held to a higher standard.\u201d \u201cWe have to work harder and that is a fact,\u201d Klobuchar said. Klobuchar added: \"If you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.\" Klobuchar was responding to Buttigieg's defense of his level of experience. He argued that while he has not had a long career in public office, he does \u201chave the right experience to take on Donald Trump.\u201d Some Democrats \u2013 including Klobuchar \u2013 have questioned Buttigieg's level of experience. The mayor leads a city of just over 100,000 people and was elected by just a few thousand people. He was overwhelmingly defeated when he ran for a statewide office in Indiana in 2010. \u201cI get that it is not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now,\u201d Buttigieg said, noting that he \u201ccomes from the kinds of communities\u201d that are critical in 2020 and that he has military experience. As for being mayor, Buttigieg said he has a \u201cdifferent kind of experience\u201d where he was \u201csolving problems working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar has talked for more than five minutes. Meanwhile, billionaire businessman Tom Steyer has talked for about a minute and a half. We're tracking speaking times for each candidate during the fifth\u00a0Democratic presidential debate. Follow our live tracker here. Former Vice President Joe Biden said it would be up to his attorney general to decide whether to prosecute President Donald Trump. \u201cI would not direct it, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say, lock him up. Look, we have to bring this country together,\u201d Biden said. He said \u201cthe next president who starts tweeting,\u201d and then interrupted himself mid-sentence, saying, \u201cAnyway.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country,\u201d Biden said. \u201cFollow the law, let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.\u201d Amy Klobuchar said she raised $17,000 for her first campaign for US Senate in 2006 from ex-boyfriends. \"My first Senate race I literally called everyone I knew and I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends,\" she said. \"I'd like to point out it is not an expanding base.\" Klobuchar came as she was talking about gerrymandering and needing to do something to fix the system to make sure \"we don't have money in politics from the outside.\" During her opening remarks tonight, California Sen. Kamala Harris addressed the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, which reached a crescendo today with the bombshell testimony from EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland. \"First of all, we have a criminal living in the White House. And there is no question that in 2020 the biggest issue before us until we get to that tender moment is justice on the ballot. And what we saw today, Ambassador Sondland by his own words told us, that everyone was in the loop. That means, it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President, from what we heard today, the Vice President, the Secretary of State and chief of staff,\" Harris said.  Earlier today: EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland confirmed for all to see that\u00a0there was a quid pro quo\u00a0with Ukraine, that Trump withheld a White House meeting until Ukraine launched investigations into the Bidens. \"I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo?\" Sondland said. \"As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.\" An abridged version of the health care debate that\u2019s played out in every Democratic presidential debate so far took place again early in Wednesday night\u2019s showdown -- with candidates sticking with their now-familiar stances. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren touted the benefits of \"Medicare for All.\" When moderators turned to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, he said, \u201cThank you, I wrote the damn bill!\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden said Medicare for All is politically unpopular. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn\u2019t pass the House,\u201d he said, arguing instead for a public option. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg touted \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d -- his more moderate proposal -- as \u201csomething that as a governing strategy we can unify the American people around.\u201d South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg invoked recent comments from former President Barack Obama tonight, arguing that he can unite the country when Obama couldn\u2019t because of new consensus around a host of issues including even once controversial topics like immigration and guns. \u201cAs President Obama commented recently, we are not in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThere is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn\u2019t exist in the same way even a few years ago.\u201d After mentioning immigration and guns \u2013 two issues he said Democrats were once on the defense about \u2013 Buttigieg added, \u201cWe have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority.\u201d Obama, at a high-dollar donor confab earlier this month, urged the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls to \u201cpay some attention to where voters actually are,\u201d warning them about going so far on certain policies that they become out of step with voters. \u201cMy one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are,\u201d Obama said, specifically saying he doesn\u2019t think candidates should be \u201cdiluted into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders quipped \"I wrote the damn bill\" following Sen. Elizabeth Warren's lengthy answer on \"Medicare for All.\" Warren had been talking for a while about her plan for Medicare for All, a policy proposed by Sanders, when the moderator eventually asked Sanders for his response. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren lambasted wealthy campaign donors receiving ambassadorships as tonight\u2019s Democratic debate kicked off with questions about impeachment. Implicitly referencing Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland -- who had contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund and testified in front of a House panel on Wednesday -- Warren offered a warning to campaign donors.  \u201cDon\u2019t ask to be an ambassador, because I\u2019m not going to have that happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder,\u201d Warren said. In October, Warren released a proposal that included a pledge to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline.  \"My plan will make it the law by prohibiting campaign donations and political spending from being a consideration in the selection of an ambassador,\" she wrote. Warren also said she would encourage Republican senators to vote to remove Trump from office, and said her argument to them would begin with encouraging GOP lawmakers to read Robert Mueller\u2019s report. Following a day filled with testimonies in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders used his first speaking opportunity tonight at the Democratic debate in Atlanta to address the President.  \"He is likely the most corrupt President in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump. Because if we are, we are going to lose the election,\" Sanders said. Sanders went on to mention issues like health care and climate change are more pressing concerns.  Tonight's debate opened with a question on impeachment. Earlier today, three US officials testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow asked Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren if she will try to convince her Republicans colleagues to vote for impeachment. Here's what she said: Ten Democratic candidates just took the stage\u00a0tonight's debate in Atlanta, Georgia. The debate, hosted by\u00a0MSNBC\u00a0and The\u00a0Washington Post, takes place in the shadow of televised\u00a0impeachment hearings\u00a0in Washington. Hours before the debate's start time, officials, including the US ambassador to the European Union, publicly appeared before the House Intelligence Committee.

Bernie Sanders\nBusinessman Tom Steyer\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\nBusinessman Andrew Yang The pool of Democratic presidential candidates is growing and shrinking at the same time. Since the last debate, three candidates have suspended their campaigns: Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke\nOhio Rep. Tim Ryan\nMiramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam Former Massachusetts Gov.

Yang, the businessman-turned-politician who has mounted an unexpectedly strong presidential campaign, tweeted tonight an hour before the fifth Democratic debate that he wished a certain former candidate was still around. Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, ended his campaign earlier this month. The two got to know each other backstage at town halls and debates. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick just canceled his event at Morehouse College in Atlanta when he arrived and was told only two people were in the audience. Julian Hemmings, president and founder of New Deal Democrats at Morehouse College who organized the event, told CNN that Patrick, who announced last week he is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was invited to come to Morehouse yesterday, so this event tonight was planned on very short notice. Patrick is in Atlanta, where tonight's Democratic debate is being held. Patrick will not be on the stage tonight because he announced his candidacy after the qualification deadline.  Up until five minutes before the event, no one was in the audience. Then, two female students entered, who told CNN that organizers of the event asked them to attend as they were passing by in the hallway.\u00a0 According to Hemmings, when Patrick arrived earlier this evening and was told only two people were in the audience, he decided to cancel the event.\u00a0 Steve\u00a0Bullock\u00a0will begin airing a TV ad in Iowa featuring the \u201cLock him up\u201d chant baseball fans aimed at President Trump during the World Series, his campaign announced today ahead of the Democratic debate in Atlanta that the Montana governor did not qualify for. The ad opens with the chant and images of Trump. The chants were created by Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and were usually aimed at 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Bullock\u00a0follows up with a pledge to \u2014as president \u2014 continue to look into the Trump administration and prosecute him, if warranted. \u201cAs a sitting president, Donald Trump can\u2019t be prosecuted. And the truth is, if he\u2019s re-elected, he never will be \u2014 because the statute of limitations will run out,\u201d\u00a0Bullock\u00a0says on camera. \u201cI\u2019m Steve\u00a0Bullock, and I won\u2019t promise to lock up my opponent. But as the only Democrat running who won a state Trump won, I will promise this: After I beat Trump, I\u2019ll empower prosecutors to follow the evidence all the way to the top,\u201d he continues. Bullock, the former Montana attorney general, finishes the ad by saying he approves the message because \u201cno one\u2019s above the law.\u201d The ad will be part of\u00a0Bullock\u2019s $500,000 buy in Iowa and will begin airing today in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate, will face a crucial moment in his campaign in tonight's debate, as the New Jersey senator struggles to boost his polling and keep his White House hopes alive. Booker is at risk of failing to qualify for the December debate. His team recognizes that the debate presents a crucial chance to alter his campaign\u2019s trajectory. \u201cThe stakes are pretty high for us right now,\u201d a Booker campaign aide said. \u201cWe know this is a big moment for us.\u201d Booker has focused in his debate preparations on making his responses more concise and impactful, the aide said. But he and his team understand that he will walk onto the debate stage as an \u201cunderdog.\u201d Booker will be positioned at the far end of the stage, making it more difficult for him to grab the spotlight from the frontrunners. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d the aide said. Strolling about the 330 acres of Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, Georgia is like stepping back in time. Or into the future. With more than 200 acres of green space and a prime location minutes from the airport and downtown, the studio complex has been attracting a wide range of projects. And it's not just a venue for movies and TV series. MSNBC and The Washington Post will host the fifth Democratic presidential debate at Tyler Perry Studios tonight. More on the studios: Steve Mensch, president and general manager of studio operations, recently gave CNN a behind-the-scenes tour of what formerly was the Fort McPherson army base. \"The history on this property is immense. Founded in 1885, we have 40 buildings on the national register, we've built a dozen state of the art sound stages,\" Mensch said. \"We've got a dozen practical shooting locations. So what Tyler has built here is the only major motion picture studio on the East coast.\" Old meets new in the historic district where the post commander's house \u2014 built in 1889 \u2014 maintains its original craftsmanship. It now serves as the home of the character Brian Simmons (played by Perry), who has appeared in multiple Perry productions. It's a house where former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt once stayed and now retired general Colin Powell lived while commander. Keep reading here. A lot has happened since Democrats last took the stage in October. These are some key issues that could come up tonight: The impeachment inquiry: The House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump has moved into the public phase with several key testifying in televised hearings on Capitol Hill. Democrats are discussing\u00a0a timeframe\u00a0that would include votes on whether to impeach Trump by Christmas, multiple Democratic sources have told CNN.\nA candidate drops out, while others jump in: Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke dropped out earlier this month. Meanwhile, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has recently filed paperwork to get on the Democratic primary ballots in two states, is now considering jumping in the race. Former Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Deval Patrick\u00a0announced a late-entry 2020 presidential campaign\u00a0last week.\nWhat the latest polls show: Former Vice President Joe Biden tops the Democratic primary field in the early voting state of South Carolina, according to new polls from\u00a0Quinnipiac University\u00a0and the\u00a0University of North Florida. About a third of likely voters in South Carolina plan to support the former vice president, according to both polls. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, holds a clear lead in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, climbing to 25% in a\u00a0new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. The Democratic National Committee has progressively raised the qualifying thresholds for the primary Democratic debates that began in June. To make the November stage, these are the thresholds the candidates had to meet: Candidates had to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved national or early state polls or at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\nCandidates also had to raise money from 165,000 separate donors, including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories. More on this: Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary, reached the donor threshold, his campaign said, but the former San Antonio, Texas, mayor did not come close to reaching the polling threshold. Some candidates dropped out after it became clear they were not going to make the debate stage. Castro's team has said the former secretary has no immediate plans to do that. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who was on the debate stage in October, dropped out earlier this month. Ten presidential candidates will take the stage tonight at the fifth Democratic debate hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post in Atlanta, Georgia. These are the candidates who will appear on stage tonight: Former Vice President Joe Biden\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\nHawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\nBusinessman Tom Steyer\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\nBusinessman Andrew Yang The most notable candidate to miss this month's debate will be Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary, who did not receive a single poll that moved him closer to reaching the committee's polling threshold."], "Language": false}
