Whether you're shopping for your girlfriend, your wife, your mom or your best friend, the annual day of love is a lovely excuse to remind each of those special people that you treasure her presence and all she brings to your life. And we have great news: You really don't need to break the bank and buy diamond earrings for that special lady. (Though if you want to, these will certainly do.) Below we've compiled a robust list of gifts that range from practical to fun, and thoughtful to romantic.  And remember, when in doubt on Valentine's Day, you can never ever go wrong with flowers, chocolates or a cute pair of pajamas. (And, um, maybe some microwavable slippers, too.)

Intimacy Deck ($24.99; amazon.com) If your date nights include Netflix, takeout and falling asleep on the couch, it's time to turn off the TV and open this deck of cards. The game includes 150 conversation-starting questions \u2014 such as \"When did you realize you were in love with me?\" and \"What do I do that turns you on the most?\" \u2014 that aim to reconnect partners and improve quality time. _______________________________________________________________________________ Intelex Microwavable Slippers ($19, originally $24.99; amazon.com) Yes, you could buy her slippers.
