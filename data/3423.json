Coronavirus\u00a0 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in intensive care after being admitted to the hospital with\u00a0worsening coronavirus symptoms. The 55-year-old PM has deputized\u00a0Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to fill in for\u00a0leadership duties when necessary. Across the world, most of Japan has entered a state of emergency today, which will last for a month. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has advised people stay home and practice social distancing. However, Abe is also facing criticism for not activating such measures earlier, as the full global weight of the crisis became clear. Even the tiny South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu is not immune to social complications from coronavirus. The country\u00a0was just hit by a tropical cyclone, one of the strongest ever on record to reach the island, which has forced the government to lift social distancing measures for those affected. \u00a02. Election 2020\u00a0 Today's Wisconsin primary will go on after a game of tug-o-war between the state's Gov. Tony Evers, Republican leaders and the state Supreme Court. Evers issued\u00a0an 11th-hour executive order to delay the election until June, but the state Supreme Court blocked it. The US Supreme Court then\u00a0reversed a lower court ruling brought into question by Republican leaders that had given voters six more days to turn in their absentee ballots. So, in short, Wisconsin voters without absentee ballots have to go to the polls today, regardless of social distancing orders. Voters with absentee ballots need to send them out today, or their votes won't count. The Supreme Court's decision draws a controversial line in the sand when it comes to other voting disputes, and may make it harder for other states and other elections to give voters options as the pandemic rages on. 3. Health President Trump has announced a deal with 3M that will see the company produce\u00a0166.5 million masks -- nearly all N95s -- to distribute to healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Administration officials said Trump's employment of the Defense Production Act helped smooth the deal. However, there's still a dire need for more personal protective equipment (PPE) on the front lines of the crisis. A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to take \"aggressive federal action\" in addressing the shortage of\u00a0respirators, gloves, gowns, and eye protection that have left medical professionals across the country begging for more support. States desperate for medical supplies like ventilators have even turned to each other for support, with states less hard-hit by the virus lending critical equipment to those more in need.\u00a0 4. White supremacy For the first time in history, the US State Department has named a white supremacist organization as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The group in question is the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), which the department describes as \"a terrorist group that provides paramilitary-style training to neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\" The State Department doesn't have the authority to apply such a designation to groups with strong US ties, but said the decision was made to help prevent the group from spreading its ideology and tactics in the country. Officials have warned that the threat\u00a0of white supremacist terror is on the rise at home and abroad, with several violent incidents making headlines across the world in recent years.\u00a0 5. The Vatican Cardinal George Pell\u00a0has been freed\u00a0from prison after Australia's High Court unanimously overturned his conviction\u00a0on five counts of historical child sex abuse. The decision ends a five-year battle that began when an adult man told police Pell had abused him when he was a child in the 1990s. At the time,\u00a0Pell was Vatican Treasurer and the highest ranking Catholic official to ever be publicly accused of child sex offenses. Advocates say the decision will be a\u00a0blow to survivors whose faith in the legal system's response to abuse was bolstered by the verdict.\u00a0The President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Mark Coleridge also acknowledged that the ruling could\u00a0be devastating for some.
