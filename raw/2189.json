There are 61 ventilators available in the state warehouses, New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. Persichilli said there is a concern about the number of ventilators, and that they are looking for another option. \"We do inventories of alternative ventilators, anesthesia machines, BiPAP machines, home ventilators,\" Persichilli said. \"We\u2019re having the most efficient and effective result with anesthesia machines, of which we have a lot of, but they do\u00a0have to be modified.\u201d Murphy said officials were on the phone with the White House Saturday morning and expressed that ventilators are a priority.

Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said the masks would be distributed at places like subway stations and other transport hubs by police officers or civil protection workers. Their use would be recommended but not required. Health Minister Salvador Illa said the use of the masks would be useful especially when social distancing can\u2019t be met. Grande-Marlaska also announced that 1,700 police officers nationwide have been affected by Covid-19. At the same news conference, Illa said that just over 25,000 workers in the health sector had been infected since the virus hit Spain. Grande-Marlaska said there had been \"a slight increase\" in the number of incidents where people had left their homes without reason. He said that on Good Friday, traffic was down 95% compared to normal and entry into Madrid and Barcelona was down 93%. Illa repeated that the nationwide lockdown continues \"at least\" until April 26. ##Health## A constitutional lawyer says President Trump might not have the authority to completely reopen the country from restrictions put in place to help combat the coronavirus pandemic. Page Pate, a criminal defense and constitutional attorney, told CNN that the Constitution and US Supreme Court interpretation does not give the President the authority to override governors' decisions. \"If we have a governor enact a\u00a0particular restriction that's\u00a0more restrictive than the\u00a0President wants, of course the President can\u00a0suggest that the governor not do\u00a0that,\" Pate said. \"But as far as coming in and\u00a0telling a specific governor you've got to reopen your schools, you\u00a0have to allow businesses to\u00a0reopen, a president can only do that if\u00a0the state restriction interferes\u00a0with interstate commerce.\" Some context: This insight comes after President Trump said Friday at the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing that the decision to reopen the country's economy will be the \"biggest decision\" he's ever made. Pate said although this is how the Constitution is interpreted, this particular issue has not played out in the courts before. \"If you look at the\u00a0constitution, the president's\u00a0responsibilities and authority\u00a0ends with the federal\u00a0government.\u00a0He cannot control the individual\u00a0states as far as specific local\u00a0restrictions,\" he said. ##Daily Life## At least 343 homeless people have tested positive for Covid-19, according to a city official at the press conference with Mayor Bill de Blasio today.

As airlines across Europe have grounded planes and temporarily laid-off workers, some companies are encouraging flight attendants to train to help hospitals with the coronavirus crisis. A cabin crew from SAS Scandanavian Airlines underwent training at Sophiahemmet hospital in Stockholm to learn how to \"best how to take care of patients to relieve the hard-working heroes in healthcare\" using their existing medical emergency training, said SAS on Twitter.  The airline said another SAS flight crew in Norway is connecting with the health care sector to tackle needs that emerge during the coronavirus crisis. SAS temporarily halted most of its flight traffic on March 16 and temporarily laid-off 90% of its total workforce. In the United Kingdom, some flight attendants for EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic have volunteered to help out at the new National Health Service (NHS) hospitals being set up specifically for coronavirus patients. In a statement released Thursday, EasyJet said cabin crew members who sign up to help would perform clinical support roles at the NHS \"Nightingale\" field hospitals that are being built in London, Birmingham and Manchester. \"They will change beds, tend to patients and ensure they are as comfortable as possible. Many airline staff are ideal volunteers as they have been first aid trained and hold other medical qualifications as well as being security cleared,\" said the statement. \"Expert training will be provided to all new recruits when they sign up. With the majority of flights currently suspended as a result of the pandemic, cabin crew will be able to put their unique skill set to use during this time to provide much needed support to the NHS.\" Virgin Atlantic said their crews will also perform clinical support roles, and the staff and volunteers working at the new hospitals will be offered free accommodation and meals. ##Travel## ##Business## Mayor Bill de Blasio plans on having at least 6,000 vulnerable single homeless residents in hotel rooms by April 20, the New York City mayor said at a press conference Saturday. Homeless seniors will be prioritized and any homeless person with symptoms or has tested positive for Covid-19 will be moved to a hotel, de Blasio said. The mayor will also put homeless individuals in hotels if they can\u2019t practice clear social distancing guidelines. New York City public schools will remained closed until the end of this school year due to coronavirus concerns, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference early Saturday morning. De Blasio said reopening schools for a few weeks is unrealistic because of the amount of preparation that is needed to do it safely. He said bringing students back until June does not provide much reward academically, and if buildings did reopen, many of them would have to close again because of individual coronavirus cases. City officials will be working with the state of New York to meet state regulations of how many hours students have to be in the classroom. Student classrooms hours will be consistent with social distancing guidelines, the mayor said. The mayor laid out a five point plan to help students:\u00a0 Complete deliveries of internet enabled digital devices by the end of April. The city distributed about 66,000 devices already, but will need to get 240,000 more devices in the children hands over the next few weeks, the mayor said.\nExpand parent help line and tech support hours and staffing. De Blasio said the city will be adding more educators to provide more coaching for parents.\nLaunch new online activities and programs. This includes free programing to help families get through this, de Blasio said. He also mentioned they are working with New York media companies to accomplish this.\nGraduate our seniors. There are about 75,000 students set to graduate. The mayor said he doesn\u2019t know if there will be a ceremony, but want to make sure they graduate on time \u2013\u2013 a full plan will be out next week.\nBe ready to reopen in September and combat learning loss. The mayor said the city is working now on a comprehensive plan to reopen schools. This includes focusing on mental health, de Blasio said. Attendance is being taken once a day at virtual schools, the New York City chancellor said, as he cautioned they are getting in contact with students that have not been in contact with them. When asked if summer school would happen this year, de Blasio responded, officials won\u2019t know about summer school \u201cuntil we have a lot more answers.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged the mayor's position on schools in a press conference hours later but added \u201cthere has been no decision on schools.\u201d \u201cThere has been no decision, that\u2019s the mayor's opinion, I value it\u201d along with all the other county executives but \u201cthe decision will be coordinated among all of them,\" Cuomo said. Regarding the mayor\u2019s position of closing schools until June, Cuomo said \u201cwe may do that, but we're going to do it in a coordinated sense with the other localities,\u201d including the counties in New York. When asked if de Blasio's decision was invalid, Cuomo said \u201cthat\u2019s his opinion, but he didn\u2019t close them and he can\u2019t open them, it happened on a metropolitan wide basis and we\u2019re going to either; we\u2019ll act on a metropolitan wide basis.\" Some context: The New York City school system is the largest school district in the US with 1.1 million students, according to the city's Department of Education. ##Daily Life## The United Kingdom's death toll from coronavirus has risen by 917 to reach 9,875, according to new figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care. The numbers are current as of 5 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET) April 10. Overall, the department says 78,991 people have tested positive for the virus since the outbreak began. Read a tweet from the department: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy are pushing for Congress to pass more money for the Payroll Protection Program \u2013\u2013 a program for small business aid in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. McConnell and McCarthy issued a statement today supporting the continued funding of the program without any other provisions. So far, Democrats are demanding money be added for states and hospitals before they will support the effort. \u201cRepublicans did not ask to change any policy details that were negotiated by both parties and passed unanimously. All we want to do is put more money into a popular job-saving policy which both parties designed together,\" the statement said. McConnell and McCarthy's statement also said they would, \u201ccontinue to seek a clean PPP funding increase. We hope our Democratic colleagues familiarize themselves with the facts and the data before the program runs dry.\u201d The state of the economy: Another 6.6 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the week ending April 4.  Altogether, more than 16 million Americans have sought aid in the form of jobless benefits in just the prior three weeks alone. ##Daily Life## A federal judge released celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti from a federal jail due to coronavirus concerns. The judge said Avenatti will have to return to custody in 90 days. The temporary release came after Avenatti\u2019s lawyers said he was at risk for contracting coronavirus because he had pneumonia last year.  Avenatti will be required to be held in quarantine at the jail facility for 14 days to ensure he doesn\u2019t have the virus and can\u2019t spread it into the community, the judge said.  Once jail officials determine Avenatti doesn\u2019t have the virus, he will be released to home confinement at his friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles and will not be allowed to use the internet. A second friend posted a $1 million bond securing his release.\u00a0 Some context: The attorney has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan after a California judge revoked his bail earlier this year finding he engaged in suspicious financial transactions. The MCC has reported cases of the virus among inmates.\u00a0 Avenatti was convicted earlier this year of attempting to extort over $20 million from Nike. He has been charged in two separate indictments with embezzling $300,000 from his former client Stormy Daniels and with tax fraud and stealing several million dollars from other clients. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to those charges. His trials have been set for later this year. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called on citizens to refrain from visiting nightlife entertainment venues as the country sees increasing spikes in coronavirus infections. Speaking at a meeting of the national coronavirus task force on Saturday, Abe asked people to avoid going to evening spots such as nightclubs and bars and follow the social distancing guidance. Abe also urged businesses in seven prefectures, including Tokyo, to cut down the number of people going to the office by at least 70% and implement work from home systems. The prime minister on Tuesday said Japan needs to reduce 70-80% of human contacts in the next two weeks to reverse the increasing trend of new coronavirus cases. Despite Abe\u2019s plea, urban cities in the country haven\u2019t seen a drastic reduction in the number of commuters. State of emergency declared: Japan issued a state of emergency on April 7 for a month across seven virus-hit prefectures but it carries no penalties for people venturing out for non-essential work. Earlier on Saturday, Japan\u2019s health ministry reported 658 new confirmed coronavirus cases and six deaths by the end of Friday. ##Health## ##Daily Life## For Lucia Dario, a nurse caring for Covid-19 patients at the Gemelli hospital in Rome, it is the emotional side of this epidemic that has been particularly draining.\u00a0 Yes, the full body suit gets sweaty and wearing three pairs of gloves on top of each other \u2014 a necessary protection against the virus \u2014 makes her feel clumsy.\u00a0 But it's the feeling of not being able to do more that is the toughest, she says. For the first few days of Italy's coronavirus crisis, she'd finish her shift, get into her car and cry. She felt useless.\u00a0 \"The isolation rooms are like bunkers, they are parallel realities,\" she said, describing the eerie atmosphere on the ward as \"silence that screams.\" Dario and her colleagues are the only human contact these patients' rooms get.  \"We ask them what they need, almost everyone says nothing, at most they ask for water,\" she said. Some lock eyes with her, she said, almost to signal that they will meet again one day, without the masks. She hears people sobbing, coughing and praying through the night. \"Some turn the TV on at a very high volume to stop their thoughts,\" the nurse said.\u00a0 Hospitals around the world have been on strict lockdown, banning visitors and limiting contact between patients, due to the highly infectious virus.\u00a0 Oli Pohlov\u00e1 is a part-time nurse at the pulmonology\u00a0ward of a hospital in the Czech town of Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav. With more than 600 beds, this hospital plays an important role in the region. It's normally buzzing with activity, but since Covid-19 hit, its doors have been shut to all visitors.\u00a0 \"It's very hard for the patients, many of them have not seen their families for a really long time,\" she said. So, as well as all the other tasks, nurses have also found themselves trying to give patients some company and relief from not being able to see their loved ones. \"It's up to us now to chat with them, try to make them laugh for a bit, ask questions... you can't substitute the families, of course, but hopefully you can help a bit,\" Pohlov\u00e1 said. Dario has been a nurse for 20 years, but she said she has never witnessed anything like this crisis.  This experience will mark all of us,\u201d she said.  One dying patient has recently asked Dario to read her the last rites. \"We are not priests of course, but we tried to do our best,\" Dario said. She prayed with the elderly woman. She passed away later, alone, far from her family.\u00a0 READ MORE: The nurses risking it all on the frontline of Britain's coronavirus outbreak ##Health## US cases top half a million: Half a million Americans\u00a0have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. The grim statistic means that almost one in three cases worldwide is found in the United States. New York state alone has more cases than any other country except the US. As the country recorded the biggest single-day jump in Covid-19 deaths, President Donald Trump announced he will create an\u00a0\"opening our country\" taskforce. But as health experts study China and other countries that are starting to lift some of the harshest restrictions, they warn that \"opening\" the US should not be rushed. European countries cautiously consider easing lockdown: Earlier this week, China started allowing healthy people to leave Wuhan, where the outbreak emerged in December. In Europe, several countries are now cautiously following in China's footsteps. Though mass gatherings and international travel remain largely off limits, some shops, outdoor exercise centers and schools are beginning to reopen in some countries including the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark and Norway. Austria will gradually lift its lockdown after Easter, but quarantine in prominent ski resorts has been extended by more than two weeks after coronavirus tests showed the\u00a0virus is still widespread in the Alpine province of Tyrol. Boris Johnson's brother criticizes PM's pre-hospitalization treatment: Max Johnson, the half-brother of Boris Johnson has described the Prime Minister\u2019s pre-hospitalization treatment as a \u201cshambles.\u201d \u00a0On Saturday, a Downing Street spokesperson said the Prime Minister \u201ccontinues to make very good progress\u201d after he was released from intensive care Thursday. Johnson remains in hospital. Nearly 60,000 people have recovered from coronavirus in Spain, but the number of deaths recorded in Spain has risen by 510 in the past 24 hours -- an increase of 3.2%. ##Daily Life## The half-brother of Boris Johnson has described the Prime Minister\u2019s pre-hospitalization treatment as a \u201cshambles.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Max Johnson said while he grateful for the care his brother received from the NHS (National Health Service), he is critical of the events leading up to his hospitalization. Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care after receiving treatment for coronavirus, Downing Street confirmed Thursday. The Prime Minister, 55, was taken to hospital on Sunday because he was displaying \"persistent\" coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive. His condition deteriorated and he was taken into intensive care on Monday, causing a ripple of shock across the UK. \u201cFrom what I gather -- and I wasn\u2019t there -- no-one asked a doctor to mask up and physically examine him the whole time - more than 10 days,\u201d Max Johnson said.\n\u201cHe\u2019d tested positive so there was no doubt what he was dealing with. The word \u2018shambles\u2019 comes to mind.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of bodyguards when you can\u2019t have a doctor? The Office of Prime Minister needs better protection.\u201d In response to Max Johnson\u2019s comments, Downing Street described the Prime Minister\u2019s health as a \u201cprivate matter\u201d adding it would be \u201cinaccurate\u201d to suggest Boris Johnson hadn\u2019t been physically examined by a doctor before entering hospital. Max Johnson said he\u2019s \u201cmassively relieved\u201d by his brother\u2019s recovery and hopes he can now take time off to full recover. He added that the coronavirus pandemic is a good reminder of the need to ensure all frontline workers -- including the NHS, police, bus drivers, and care workers -- get access to proper safety equipment and testing. \u201cAnd we can play our part by just staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives,\u201d Max Johnson said. Since the outbreak began, the government has faced intense criticism over lack of testing and protection for frontline workers.\u00a0 A total of 59,109 people in Spain have now recovered after contracting coronavirus -- an increase of more than 11,000 over the past three days -- according to new data from the Spanish Health Ministry released Saturday. However, the number of deaths recorded in Spain has risen by 510 in the past 24 hours, an increase of 3.2%. The total number of deaths stands at 16,353.  Active cases increase: The number of active cases rose to 86,390 (a figure that excludes those who have died or recovered from the virus). That\u2019s an increase of 1.5% -- slightly higher than the rate of increase over the past four days. There are at least 501,615 cases of coronavirus in the US and at least 18,777 people have died in the US from coronavirus, according to a Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States. The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases.\u00a0 Wyoming is the only state that is not reporting a death from coronavirus. Officials warn of risk of ending social distancing measures: If the US ends social distancing and other coronavirus mitigation strategies by May 1, as President Donald Trump has encouraged, case numbers in the country could rebound, officials warned. The projections are based on new modeling scenarios run by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington that assume social distancing policies will end from next month. \"The risk of rebound is very great,\" IHME Director Dr. Chris Murray told CNN late Friday. The projections are based on new modeling scenarios run by IHME that assume social distancing policies will end from next month. \"If we were to stop at the national level May 1st, we're seeing (in models) a return to almost where we are now sometime in July, so a rebound ... Definitely there's a very substantial risk of rebound if we don't wait to the point where most transmission is near zero in each state.\" The research center plans to release state-level analyses based on the new models next week, Murray said.\u00a0 The warning comes after Trump said he wanted to reopen the country's economy, despite many researchers and medical staff saying it's far too early for such a move. Ecuador reported a significant jump of 2,196 new coronavirus cases over the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to 7,161, the country's Ministry of Health announced on Friday. While those numbers represent the biggest daily jump over a 24-hour period, authorities are advising that some of those infections may have occurred at an earlier time without being registered then.\u00a0 So far 297 people have died from the virus, the ministry said. Bodies left on the streets: The majority of the cases were reported in the country's most populous city of\u00a0Guayaquil and\u00a0Guayas province, where residents said health services have collapsed and dead bodies of victims had to be left on the streets for collection by authorities.\u00a0 President Lenin Moreno has called for an investigation into the mishandling of bodies of coronavirus victims.\u00a0\u00a0 In a televised speech Friday evening, Moreno said every citizen plays a role in overcoming the crisis and called for solidarity and discipline when it comes to social distancing and security measures.\u00a0 Winning this war depends on each one of us,\" Moreno said.\u00a0\"During an emergency every minute counts, the actions of each person can change everything.\"\u00a0 Emergency could turn into \"social tragedy\": \"The painful experience of other countries, some of the most developed countries in the world, shows that if we don't implement an emergency plan, the emergency could turn into social tragedy because of the lack of employment, lack of income and lack of food,\" Moreno said, adding that his government is doing its best to make sure that medical workers have enough equipment and protective gear.\u00a0 Also on Friday, the mayor of the city of\u00a0Guayaquil,\u00a0Cynthia Viteri,\u00a0reiterated her call for help and her criticism towards the national government in an interview with CNNE.\u00a0 Viteri\u00a0acknowledged that her city and the province of Guayas are currently the epicenter of outbreak in the country and said the number of deaths is likely even higher than the reported figures.\u00a0 Can I explain why? Because tests were not available before, they [people] die without being tested, and there is no space to conduct autopsies and the subsequent examinations,\" she said.\u00a0\n##Health##\n##Daily Life## Stringent lockdown measures at two prominent Austrian ski resorts have been extended by more than two weeks after coronavirus tests showed the\u00a0virus is still widespread in the Alpine province of Tyrol, local\u00a0authorities said.\u00a0 Speaking at a press\u00a0conference Friday, Tyrol Governor Guenther Platter said, \"Due to the continued existence of infection chains, on the advice of medical experts, we have no choice but to extend the quarantines for the Paznaun Valley and St. Anton for a further two weeks until April 26.\"\u00a0 Alpine lockdown: The Alpine ski resorts of\u00a0St. Anton am Arlberg and Ischgl, as well as the\u00a0Paznaun\u00a0valley\u00a0surrounding\u00a0Ischgl,\u00a0have been on lockdown since March 13, when it became\u00a0apparent that the\u00a0resorts were a breeding ground for coronavirus infections.\u00a0 Authorities in Tyrol are accused of having reacted too late to the first signs of the coronavirus outbreak in Tyrol -- particularly in Ischgl --- contributing to the spread of the virus in Europe and beyond. Almost 3,000 tests carried out within a day showed that up to 19% of the people tested showed signs of coronavirus infection, Platter said.  He said the extended lockdown measures were \"very dramatic\" for those affected, who already lived isolated from the outside world for about four weeks, but it is now essential to prevent the virus from spreading at all costs. Austria to lift lockdown: Earlier this week, the Austrian government said it would gradually begin to reopen shops after Easter, making it the first country in Europe to do so.\u00a0 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Austria has reached 13,561 and the death toll stood at 319, the country's health ministry said Saturday.\u00a0The\u00a0Alpine province of Tyrol accounts for almost 25% of coronavirus cases in the country. Nineteen health workers in the UK have died from coronavirus, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock says. \u201cVery sadly, 19 members of the NHS family have died. My heart goes out to their families,\u201d Hancock told BBC Breakfast on Saturday.\n\u201cHere are people who have put themselves on the frontline. Now the work is going on to establish whether they caught coronavirus in the line of duty whilst at work, or whether like so many other people in the rest of their lives,\u201d he added. Hancock pointed out that a number of the NHS (National Health Service) victims are from ethnic minority backgrounds. \u201cI\u2019m particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who\u2019ve come to this country to work in the NHS who\u2019ve died of coronavirus. I find it really upsetting actually,\u201d he said. A lack of data on coronavirus and minority groups: Covid-19 has ripped through families and grounded the UK economy, and questions are mounting in the British media as to whether it is having a disproportionate effect on minority groups in Britain. But unlike the US --\u00a0where data released by Chicago and Michigan\u00a0authorities showed a clear racial disparity in coronavirus victims -- the picture is not that clear in the UK. Experts say there are many unknowns: mainly that British health authorities are not reporting race in statistics on confirmed cases or fatalities. Germany's president Frank-Walter Steinmeier is set to\u00a0address German citizens in a rare televised speech on Saturday night on the coronavirus crisis.  The German president's role is largely ceremonial, and typically the\u00a0president addresses the nation only\u00a0once a year during the annual Christmas message.\u00a0 In total, 2,544 people have died from the virus in Germany.\u00a0The total number of confirmed cases since the outbreak began has reached 117,658 -- an increase of 4,133 cases within the last day. Germany's death toll jumped by 171, according to new figures released Saturday by the Robert Koch Institute, the country's disease and control center.\u00a0 Germans asked to stay home: Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela\u00a0Merkel urged Germans to stay home over the Easter holiday despite \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that movement restrictions are slowing the coronavirus spread. Australian and New Zealand passengers have disembarked the Greg Mortimer cruise ship in Montevideo and are now en route back to Australia, according to the government of Uruguay. Stranded: The\u00a0Greg Mortimer\u00a0cruise liner, operated by Australia's Aurora Expeditions, departed March 15 on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia. Since the beginning of April,\u00a0however, the ship has been\u00a0stuck off the coast of Uruguay, after authorities refused to allow passengers to disembark due to the risk of coronavirus. Some 128 of the 217 people on board tested positive for the virus. Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne confirmed in a tweet that the flight carrying the passengers has left for Australia, and thanked the government of Uruguay for their support and cooperation. Speaking to reporters following the evacuation, Uruguay's Foreign Minister Ernesto Talvi said the country was fulfilling its ethical duty to help the stranded compatriots.

But we do want to get the country opened, so important,\" Trump\u00a0said at a briefing on Friday. ##Health## The African community in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou is on edge after widespread accounts were shared on social media of people being left homeless this week, as China's warnings against imported coronavirus cases stoke\u00a0anti-foreigner sentiment. In Guangzhou, Africans have been evicted from their homes by landlords and turned away from hotels -- despite many claiming to have no recent travel history or known contact with Covid-19 patients. CNN interviewed more than two dozen Africans living in Guangzhou, many of whom told of the same experiences: being left without a home, being subject to random testing for Covid-19, and being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Fears of an imported second wave: This comes amid heightened media coverage of the so-called second wave of coronavirus cases, emanating from infections outside China.  Earlier this\u00a0week, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. The fears aren't unfounded -- Hong Kong, not far from Guangzhou, has been hit hard by a second wave. At the start of March, there were only 150 cases in the city of 7.5 million, suggesting the crisis had eased. Now it has 990 cases -- and many were imported from overseas. Yet these imported cases aren't foreign citizens: 90% of China's imported cases are people with Chinese passports, said Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Zhaohui\u00a0on March 26.

Viki Bell teaches karate in Melbourne, Australia -- but her dojo is closed because of the country's social distancing rules. Instead she has started teaching classes virtually, with her students practicing the moves in their own homes on the other side of the camera. Julia Basa has used the same strategy. She teaches Zumba -- a mix of dance, pilates and aerobics -- in Melbourne, but lately has had to hold sessions online from her backyard. Other places are getting more creative. One neighborhood in the UK town of Frodsham has started doing daily dance and fitness sessions outdoors -- everyone on the road, following a resident instructor, but carefully standing a number of feet apart to adhere to social distancing criteria. ##Daily Life## When the beat drops, these health care workers know it's all about the footwork. Medical professionals across the country are participating in dance challenges on social media. It's helping them share smiles and blow off steam during the demanding coronavirus pandemic. In scrubs and swag, nurse Kala Baker lip-syncs and dances in TikTok challenges to hits like \"Savage\" by Meg Thee Stallion at Mercy Hospital in Springfield, Missouri. Baker says her challenges, which she films after clocking out, help create solidarity with health care professionals across the country -- especially in states hit hardest by coronavirus. She sees it as a way to \"bring joy to a really dark place right now.\" \"I have never felt more connected with health care workers; we all feel like we are all one big team all over the world,\" she said. \"We are trying to do it together.\" Read more here: ##Daily Life## The coronavirus has infected close to 1.7 million people globally, and killed more than 102,000. The US has passed half a million cases, and many other countries are still reporting record numbers of new cases each day. If you're just joining us, here are the biggest headlines from today: The US breaks half a million: There are now more than 501,000 cases in the US, as well as 18,000 deaths. New York state alone has more cases than any other country in the world.\nUruguay cruise: Passengers from Australia and New Zealand on the cruise ship Greg Mortimer are being evacuated and flown home. Nearly 60% of those on the ship, docked in Uruguay, are infected.\nDeaths skyrocket in Brazil: The number of coronavirus deaths has almost tripled in a week. However President Jair Bolsonaro has continuously rejected containment measures, saying the financial impact is worse than the pandemic itself.\nSouth Korea isn't kidding around: If you break quarantine rules, you have to wear a tracking bracelet. The new measures begin in two weeks.\nCompanies adjust: Tyson Foods is using walk-through infrared body temperature scanners at production plants after employees tested positive. Meanwhile, Boeing is resuming operations in some US sites after temporary closures. People in the Czech Republic can now shop at hardware and bicycle stores, play tennis and go swimming. Austria plans to reopen smaller shops after Easter. Denmark will reopen kindergartens and schools from next week if coronavirus cases remain stable, and children in Norway will return to kindergarten a week later. These nations are among the first in the West to start feeling their way out of the limits on daily life imposed by governments to curb the\u00a0spread of the coronavirus. How did they get here? The countries preparing to ease restrictions had something in common: they were among the first in Europe to implement lockdowns or severe social distancing measures, and rapidly scaled up coronavirus testing, said Dr. Peter Drobac, a global health expert at the Oxford Sa\u00efd Business School. Other countries looking to follow their path and avoid a second wave need to meet three general criteria, he said: They need to have \"bent the curve\" and seen a consistent reduction in the number of new cases.\nTheir health care systems need to be able to cope without resorting to crisis measures such as emergency hospitals.\nThey need a system in place for mass testing, contact tracing and isolation, so that sick people can be isolated early before they infect others.

The order went into effect late Friday local time, and includes essential workers. Face coverings like a scarf, bandana or cloth are required for all outings, including walks through the neighborhood. Drivers traveling alone or with members of their household don't need to wear face coverings unless they lower their windows to interact with anyone who is not a member of their household. \u201cWe believe this action will help to protect and ultimately save lives,\u201d Mayor Lester Friedman said in a statement. \u201cWhile we continue to ask our community members to remain at home, those who do go outside and the people they encounter will be safer.\u201d This differs from the Los Angles County mandate announced by Mayor Eric Garcetti on Tuesday, which does not require residents to wear face coverings while alone outside. ##Daily Life## As the coronavirus pandemic continues, the situation in early hotspots like China and South Korea is improving as the countries move away from the peak of infection. However the struggle is intensifying in India and Japan. India reported its biggest single-day jump in cases yesterday, with 1,035 new cases, the health ministry said Saturday. There were also 40 more deaths. The national total is now 7,600 cases and 249 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Japan also had its biggest single-day leap in cases, with 658 new cases and six more deaths yesterday. It was the fourth day in a row that Japan had set a new peak, and took the national total to 6,717 cases and 105 deaths. Mainland China reported 46 new cases yesterday -- 42 of which were imported from abroad. There were also three deaths and 34 new asymptomatic cases, which are counted separately from confirmed cases. The country now has 81,953 cases and 3,339 deaths from the coronavirus, according to the National Health Commission. Of those total cases, 77,525 have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. South Korea reported 30 new cases yesterday, bringing the national total to 10,450, according to data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. ##Health## Two more crew members on the USNS Mercy\u00a0hospital ship docked in Los Angeles have tested positive for the coronavirus -- taking the total to three, the US Navy confirmed on Friday. The ship is being used to treat non-coronavirus patients to help ease the burden on hospitals. \"The Covid-positive crew members are currently isolated off-ship, and will continue to self-monitor,\" Navy spokesman Andrew Bertucci said. \n\"The ship is following protocols and taking every precaution to ensure the health and safety of all crew members and patients on board.\" The cases will not affect the ability for USNS Mercy to receive patients, Bertucci told CNN. ##Health## The US now has at least 501,301\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus and at least\u00a018,758\u00a0related deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The total number of US cases come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as all cases repatriated from abroad.\u00a0 Wyoming is the only state yet to report a coronavirus death. ##Health## A woman in the southern Indian state of Telangana rode 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) on a two-wheeler scooter, over two days and nights, to bring her son home during a national lockdown. Razia Begum, 48, is the principal at a government school in the town of Bodhan. Her 19-year-old son had gone to the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh in late March, traveling with a friend who had to take an exam there. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a 21-day coronavirus lockdown on March 25, which went into effect across the country just hours after his announcement -- and Begum's son was stranded. \"He was living at a dargah (mausoleum) there because he couldn't come back, so I decided to bring him back. Since four-wheelers aren't allowed I just took my scooter,\" Begum told CNN.\u00a0 After getting permission from the commissioner of police, she set out on her journey on Monday, taking short breaks every few hours. She and her son were back home by Wednesday. \"I couldn't leave my son there,\" she said. \"We don't know how long the lockdown will go on so it is good that the entire family is safe back home.\" Begum is a single parent of two sons and a daughter. Her husband passed away 15 years ago, so she had been managing the household since. The\u00a0nationwide lockdown ends on April 15. However the states of Punjab and Odisha have already extended their lockdowns through to April 30.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## The mayor of Los Angeles urged the US to continue social distancing and ramp up coronavirus testing, warning that President Donald Trump's plan to reopen the country could place lives at risk.  \"The best way to help the economy is to make sure that we have the public health side taken care of, and the best way to save lives is to make sure that we don't open the economy early,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a press conference Friday. This came shortly after Trump announced he was convening a second coronavirus task force -- called the 'Opening our Country Council'.\u00a0 \"If you want to get the economy open, Mr. President, Congress, or any mayor, do the work of getting the public health professionals who can track and trace, get us the tests so we can have the blood tests to know who's immune and who's not, and people who are not can properly distance (themselves),\" Garcetti said. According to previous CNN reporting, modeling suggests several red states will not hit their worst points until nearly the end of April -- which means it'll be nearly impossible to reopen the economy in those areas by early May, as Trump has pushed to do. Garcetti urged national leadership to follow the guidance of medical professionals and prepare for the possibility of extended stay-at-home orders. \"This is something that will require national leadership... it's not something that we can wall off,\" he added. ##Health## ##Business## There are several treatments being studied to prevent or treat coronavirus, but US President Donald Trump has been a cheerleader for one in particular:\u00a0hydroxychloroquine, a drug currently used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Over the past month, he's made many optimistic statements about hydroxychloroquine. CNN has fact-checked the President multiple times, and found that he's being unrealistically enthusiastic. Here are the facts: How soon until we know if hydroxychloroquine works against the coronavirus? Trump said \"within days\" on March 29. Doctors say it's more like weeks or months. Of the 15 research centers conducting trials on the drug, six responded and said it would take anywhere between three weeks to four months. French researchers have already done a study showing hydroxychloroquine works as a coronavirus treatment. Doesn't that tell us something? Trump says yes -- he called it \"a very good test\" on April 5. Doctors say the study was terrible, so no. There are several concerns about the paper, including that it ignored patients who took the drug and fared poorly. Experts described the French study to\u00a0CNN\u00a0as \"a complete failure\" and \"pathetic.\" There has been so much criticism that the\u00a0journal\u00a0that published it is reviewing it again and wrote that \"a correction to the scientific record may be considered.\" Is hydroxychloroquine safe for coronavirus patients? Trump says yes. \"What do you have to lose? Take it,\" he said on April 4. Doctors say the drug can have serious side effects. The label for Plaquenil, a brand of hydroxychloroquine, says patients taking it have reported \"life threatening and fatal\" cardiac problems and \"irreversible\" vision problems.

The order, signed by the Labor Secretary on April 2, prohibits physicians, nurses, medical technicians and other medical staff from working abroad while the country remains under a state of emergency.\u00a0 The order says the Philippines sends 13,000 medical workers abroad every year -- yet  faces a shortage of 290,000 health workers at home. A lot of Filipinos go abroad to work in medicine. It can be much more lucrative in North America or Europe, with the average salary for a registered nurse under $200 a month in the Philippines, according to the country's Department of Labor. More than 17% of registered nurses in California are Filipino, a 2017 report found. And in the UK, a 2019 government report found there are more than 18,000\u00a0Filipinos working in the NHS. That's why they aren't happy with the new ban. An online petition has already gained 10,000 signatures, protesting the lost economic opportunities for Filipino nurses.\u00a0 The petition urged the government to reassess the ban, arguing that the government's compensation of $10 a day for volunteers is not enough to replace wages earned abroad.\u00a0 ##Business## ##Health## ##Travel## Passengers from Australia and New Zealand on the cruise ship Greg Mortimer will be evacuated on repatriation flights this weekend, after almost 60% of those on board tested positive for the coronavirus. The ship is docked off the coast of Montevideo, Uruguay. The passengers will leave on a medical charter flight to Melbourne early Saturday local time, according to a statement from cruise operator Aurora Expeditions. The New Zealand government will reportedly organize a transfer from Melbourne back home for its citizens. The cruise company\u2019s insurance will cover the cost of the repatriation flight. CNN affiliate Teledoce reported that 112 passengers will go directly to Carrasco Airport. They are expected to go through a sanitary corridor arranged by Uruguay. ##Travel## Churches across the world are celebrating Good Friday differently this year.

Inside some facilities, inmates have said they are locked in crammed and cramped cells without face masks and enough soap, and guards have grown concerned that they could spread the disease to their families.  At a prison in Butner, North Carolina, the number of cases jumped by dozens -- nearly 400% -- earlier this week. And in Oakdale, Louisiana,\u00a0where six inmates have died in recent days, armed corrections officers had to quell a small uprising with pepper spray on Wednesday, an official at the prison said. In his first interview since the pandemic began, Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal defended the steps his agency has taken amid what he described as the most challenging situation the federal prison system has been confronted with in decades. \"I don't think anybody was ready for this Covid, so we're dealing with it just as ready as anybody else and I'd be proud to say we're doing pretty good,\" said Carvajal, who was named director in late February during the pandemic. \"It's easy to critique those hot spots, but we don't control that.

The national death toll was 359 on April 3. On April 10, it reached 1,056. The country now has 19,789 cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has continuously rejected containment measures that affect the country\u2019s economy, saying the financial impact is much worse than the pandemic itself. He has previously dismissed the coronavirus as a \"little flu,\" and pushed to lift self-isolation measures imposed by governors in several affected Brazilian states.  ##Health## Tyson Foods, one of the world's largest meat processors, is using walk-through infrared body temperature scanners to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, executives said. \u201cWe\u2019ve purchased more than 150 infrared walk-through temperature scanners. So far, we have the scanners installed in four facilities: pork plants in Iowa and Indiana and poultry plants in Arkansas and Georgia,\" said Tom Brower, Tyson\u2019s senior vice president of health and safety, on Friday. The move comes after the company suspended operations at its Columbus Junction, Iowa, pork plant this week when more than two dozen workers contracted Covid-19 there. ##Business## ##Health## As the novel coronavirus pandemic shuts down businesses globally and sends countries into lockdown, the disruptions are threatening to cut off supply chains and increase food insecurity. The issue isn't food scarcity -- it's the world's drastic measures in response to the virus. \"Supermarket shelves remain stocked for now,\" the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said in\u00a0a report released\u00a0late last month. \"But a protracted pandemic crisis could quickly put a strain on the food supply chains, a complex web of interactions involving farmers, agricultural inputs, processing plants, shipping, retailers and more.\" Border closures, movement restrictions, and disruptions in the shipping and aviation industries have made it harder to continue food production and transport goods internationally -- placing countries with few alternative food sources at high risk Read the full story here: The US has 500,399 cases of the novel coronavirus, passing the grim half-million milestone late Friday local time.

So when an anonymous donor gave everyone in Earlham\u00a0$150 worth of gift cards for food, the community received something more valuable than money: hope. It started on March 26, when Earlham Mayor Jeff Lillie received a call from a friend who told him there was a donor interested in injecting money into the town's economy. Earlham, population 1,450, is 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Des Moines. At first, the donor, who did not reveal their identity to the mayor, said they would buy 100 gift cards from three local businesses. An hour later, his friend called Lillie again and said the donor was bumping the number up to 250. An hour after that, the number was raised to 500. \"I said to him, 'At 500, you're darn near giving a gift card to every single household in Earlham',\" Lillie said. \"When I told him there were 549 households in town, he said 'Done.' And that was it. I was ecstatic because it made sure everyone would get a card.\" But what Lillie didn't know was that the donor wasn't going to buy 549 cards in all -- they were buying 549 gift cards from each of the three businesses. In total, they donated $82,350, meaning each business received more than $27,000. Exactly one week later, every person in town woke up to a surprise in their mailbox: An envelope containing a letter from the city and three $50 gift cards to West Side Bar and Grille, Hometown Market, a grocery store, and Trostel's Broken Branch, a restaurant and coffee shop.

New York\u2019s peak number of deaths, for example, is listed as April 9 on the model. New Jersey\u2019s peak is listed as April 8. Other large states are now approaching their peaks, according to the model, which was developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine. California is expected to hit peak daily deaths within a week, on April 15. The state is expected to see 66 deaths that day.\u00a0 Pennsylvania is expected to follow a similar trajectory, hitting peak deaths on April 17, when 63 people are projected to die.\u00a0 For other large states \u2013 such as Florida and Texas \u2013 the worst is expected to come later. on April 27 and 28 respectively. Some context:\u00a0While it\u2019s unclear when exactly the state expects to return to normal, lifting social distancing measures too soon \u2013 before the peak, for example \u2013 could reignite transmission of the virus and cost lives. The current version of the model says it expects social distancing until the end of May, and assumes that states will enact other measures \u2013 such as mass screening and contact tracing \u2013 that will prevent any resurgence of the virus. The institute previously told CNN that the projections assumed social distancing until August, as the model\u2019s FAQ had stated in now-deleted language. But on Thursday, the institute\u2019s director, Chris Murray, said that was not actually the case \u2013 despite what a professor behind the model and an institute spokesperson had both said earlier. ##Health## New York City has reported 6,684 more coronavirus cases and another 651 deaths,\u00a0according to the city\u2019s website.
