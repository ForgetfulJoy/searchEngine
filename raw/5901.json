I am resolved to do everything in my power to help everyone tune out the noise and focus on what's important -- bringing truth and honest reporting to audiences on every platform available.\" WSJ editor Matt Murray: \"For me personally, more time with our journalists and less reliance on email! For our growing newsroom, while journalism is always job one, in 2020 we must accelerate digital progress with more new formats and platforms, better engagement, more experimentation, more diverse newsroom talents and structural tweaks we're implementing early this year.\" ProPublica president Richard Tofel: \"Two resolutions from me in this critical election year: That Electionland again do journalism that safeguards people's right to vote, and that we consistently report and publish revealing stories about issues voters actually care about, like health care, immigration and trade.

It would seek to confirm them and then incorporate them.\" \"To End A Presidency\" co-author Laurence Tribe: \"I resolve to feel some joy and gratitude each day.\" WaPo media critic Margaret Sullivan: \"I'm resolving to amplify good journalism (almost) as often as I criticize or point out the flawed or bad \u2014 all in the spirit of 'catch them doing something right.'\" NPR \"Morning Edition\" co-host Steve Inskeep: \"To better pace myself. Get proper sleep, delete social media on weekends, think about one thing at a time when the job allows.\" \"The Takeaway\" host Tanzina Vega: \"To figure out a work/life balance even if it means asking for help. (Gasp!)\" Rogers & Cowan/PMK chairman Cindi Berger: \"I'm going to try to balance my news addiction with soothing spa music. p.s., and you know this is going to be VERY hard for me!!!\" An alternative to resolutions Last but not least, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded with this: \"Happy new decade!
