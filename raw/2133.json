Shea didn\u2019t name or provide additional details about the employee.\u00a0 About 13% of uniformed officers are out sick, which is \u201cwell over\u201d regular sick out levels, Shea said, but noted today marks the 12th\u00a0straight day of decreasing sick-out levels. \"We are still very, very concerned about our members that are in the hospital ... our thoughts and prayers are going out to them and to their families and really to the extended NYPD family as well,\" he said. ##New York## Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN that she is exploring legal options for the city after Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the reopening of business across the state.\u00a0 \"I've searched my head and my heart on this, and I really am at a loss as to what the governor is basing this decision on, other than getting people back to work\" Bottoms said.\u00a0 Bottoms added that getting Americans back to work is \"extremely important\" but added there needs to be \"strong and health communities\" in order to have a strong economy.  She called Kemp's move \"perplexing\" and said she is urging \"people to exercise common sense, listen to the science, and stay home.\" Some background: Kemp announced yesterday that certain businesses can reopen this week in a move that breaks from the majority of state leaders and defies the\u00a0warnings of many public health officials. Kemp said specifically that fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, hair and nail salons, and massage therapy businesses can reopen as early Friday. Theaters and restaurants will be allowed to open on Monday, while bars and night clubs will remain closed for now. Bottoms today also stated that the city is \"not out of the woods yet\" as numbers as of Monday evening show the death rate across the state up by 14%. ##The South## Jean Chatsky, a finance journalist and CEO of\u00a0HerMoney.com, is answering some of your most pressing questions about the coronavirus and their money.\u00a0 One college student asked: \"I've\u00a0heard billions of dollars from\u00a0the stimulus are going to\u00a0colleges and universities.\u00a0As a college student, will I see\u00a0any of that money directly?\"\u00a0 Here's what she said: \u201cThere was $12.5 billion in the\u00a0CARES Act to go to 5,000\u00a0colleges and universities.\u00a0And the universities have to\u00a0disperse half of the money they\u00a0received directly to the\u00a0students in the form of\u00a0emergency financial aid grants.\u00a0Go to your college and\u00a0university's website, see what\u00a0they put up.\u00a0Some of them are allowing\u00a0students to apply for these grants,\u00a0some are dispersing funds to\u00a0students who receive Pell\u00a0grants.\u201d Watch more: ##Stimulus## \u00a0The US Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for a new coronavirus diagnostic test that allows for patients to collect their own samples at home and then mail those samples to a lab for testing, the administration announced today. The emergency use authorization was reissued to LabCorp, which\u00a0intends to make its Pixel by LabCorp Covid-19 test home collection kits available to consumers in most states, with a doctor\u2019s order, in the coming weeks, according to the FDA. \"Throughout this pandemic we have been facilitating test development to ensure patients access to accurate diagnostics, which includes supporting the development of reliable and accurate at-home sample collection options,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in the agency's announcement. \"The FDA\u2019s around-the-clock work since this outbreak began has resulted in the authorization of more than 50 diagnostic tests and engagement with over 350 test developers,\" Hahn said.\u00a0\"Specifically, for tests that include home sample collection, we worked with LabCorp to ensure the data demonstrated from at-home patient sample collection is as safe and accurate as sample collection at a doctor\u2019s office, hospital or other testing site. With this action, there is now a convenient and reliable option for patient sample collection from the comfort and safety of their home.\" The FDA noted that the emergency use authorization\u00a0applies only to the LabCorp Covid-19 RT-PCR Test for at-home collection, which requires a nasal swab specimen for testing using the Pixel by LabCorp Covid-19 home collection kit. The FDA said in its announcement, \"It is important to note that this is not a general authorization for at-home collection of patient samples using other collection swabs, media, or tests, or for tests fully conducted at home.\" ##Tests## Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers have struck a deal on a nearly $500 billion package to extend funding for an emergency small business lending program, provide additional funding for hospitals and expand funding for\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0testing.\u00a0 \u201cThere is still a few more i\u2019s to\u00a0dot and t\u2019s to cross, but we have\u00a0a deal, and I believe we'll pass it\u00a0today,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Schumer said that he, along with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and\u00a0Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin were on the phone\u00a0past midnight and came to an agreement \u201con\u00a0just about every issue,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s John Berman.\u00a0 A national testing plan will be a part of the package, Schumer said. \u201cTo\u00a0get the kinds of testing that is\u00a0done, to get the contract\u00a0tracing, to make the tests free,\u00a0you need a significant federal\u00a0involvement, you need a national\u00a0strategy, and the President and\u00a0Mnuchin and Meadows agreed to\u00a0that, to their credit,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Schumer also said that Trump\u2019s announcement on Twitter that he is suspended all immigration to the United States during the coronavirus pandemic is \u201canother\u00a0diversion.\u201d Watch: ##Stimulus## Jean Chatsky, a finance journalist and CEO of\u00a0HerMoney.com, is answering some of your most pressing questions about the coronavirus and their money.\u00a0 One reader asked: \u201cMy\u00a0employer is lowering my weekly\u00a0salary due to my receiving a\u00a0stimulus check.\u00a0His logic is I am still breaking\u00a0even.\u00a0Is this even legal?\" Here's how she responded: \u201cThe bottom line is it is\u00a0legal as long as you satisfy a\u00a0few ground rules.\u00a0They have to let you know that\u00a0you are receiving a salary cut\u00a0and you basically have to accept\u00a0it.\u00a0You have the right to quit.\u00a0They can't cut your salary for\u00a0work that you've already done.\u00a0It can't be discriminatory.\u00a0\u2026 And if you have a contract or if\u00a0you're a member of a union,\u00a0there has to be some sort of\u00a0negotiation.\u00a0They also can't take you below\u00a0minimum wage, but other than\u00a0that, they are allowed to do it.\u201d Watch more: ##Stimulus## All available evidence suggests the coronavirus originated in bats and was not a \u201claboratory construct\u201d, World Health Organization spokesperson Fadela Chaib said at a briefing in Geneva today. US intelligence and national security officials say the United States government\u00a0is looking into the possibility\u00a0that the novel coronavirus spread from a Chinese laboratory rather than a market. \u201cAt this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely the source of the virus which caused the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Chaib said at a briefing. \u201cHowever, all available evidence suggests that the virus has a natural animal origin and is not a manipulated or constructed virus. The virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats.\u201d \u201cMany researchers have been able to look at its genomic features \u2014 and they have found that the evidence does not support the idea that the underlying virus is a laboratory construct.\u201d\u00a0 Chaib says people should focus on facts \u2013 not \u201cspurious theories\u201d about the origins of the virus.

They hope to have it completed in the next few days for Trump to sign.\u00a0 While the language is still being finalized, the order is expected to temporarily halt the issuance of new green cards and work visas \u2014 steps that had already effectively been in place amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0 Other aspects of the order remain unclear inside the administration, including what legal authorities the President will rely upon in the order and what other elements of immigration \u2014 including family immigration and potential exemptions \u2014 might be included.\u00a0 Officials were also weighing expanded travel restrictions beyond the current bans in place from China and Europe, the official said.\u00a0 The order is expected to include some exemptions for farm workers and health care providers, according to the official, but could also exempt some other workers deemed \u201cessential.\u201d An administration official told CNN the executive order will be a \u201ctemporary 120 days or so\u201d halt on \u201csome\u201d work visas to mitigate some of the unemployment concerns.\u00a0 Some background: Trump\u00a0tweeted last night that he will sign an executive order temporarily suspending immigration to the United States as the nation battles the health and economic effects of the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.  \"In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!\" he tweeted. The US needs to be able to perform millions of coronavirus tests each week before restrictions can be safely lifted, economists and public health experts say in two different plans for\u00a0reopening\u00a0society. The two reports differ in their recommendations for just how much testing is needed. One calls for 3 to 30 million tests a week, while the other says the country will need to be doing 20 million tests a day to get a handle on the pandemic. Both proposals, though, cast doubt on the country's readiness to relax social distancing measures, which some states are already beginning to do. So far, the US has only performed about 4 million coronavirus tests, and governors have reported continued shortages of the materials needed to run tests, from chemical reagents to swabs.

Watch more: ##New York## ##Reopening## The NAACP, National African American Tobacco Prevention Network and Council on Black Health have written a joint letter to the US federal government requesting specific actions to address the racial disparity seen in Covid-19 cases and the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the black community in the United States. The letter, published last night, includes signatures from more than a dozen organizations and outlines specific short-term and long-term requests for lawmakers. In the short-term, the groups call for... Mobile Covid-19 testing in underserved communities\nCOBRA coverage for workers losing health insurance due to furloughs \n Race- and location-specific data on Covid-19 cases In the long-term, the groups call for an increased federal minimum wage and additional investments made in health care, among other requests. \"Increasingly, the data on COVID-19 underscore why our organizations exist and are joining forces at this time: Now more than ever, Black people are paying the price for our short- and long-term policy failures through compromised health and an early demise,\" NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a press release on Tuesday. \"Enough is enough.\"\u00a0 Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Monday that certain businesses can reopen this week in a move that breaks from the majority of state leaders and defies the warnings of many public health officials. Kemp said specifically that fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, hair and nail salons, and massage therapy businesses can reopen as early Friday, April 24. Theaters and restaurants will be allowed to open on Monday, April 27, while bars and night clubs will remain closed for now. The decision follows new guidance unveiled by President Donald Trump last week meant to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions. According to an influential model often cited by the White House, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Georgia hit its projected \"peak\" for daily deaths 13 days ago, on April 7. But that same model predicts that dozens of people will die each day in the coming week. And to limit a resurgence of the virus, the model says that Georgia shouldn't start relaxing social distancing until after June 15 \u2014 when the state can begin considering other measures to contain the virus, such as contact tracing and isolation. Notably, Kemp said Monday that no local ordinance can restrict the openings, which will be implemented statewide.  The Republican governors of Tennessee and South Carolina on Monday signaled similar phased reopenings, despite South Carolina not meeting the suggested reopening criteria from the White House. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced his statewide stay-at-home order will expire April 30, and the vast majority of businesses in 89 counties allowed to reopen on May 1. Businesses may open even sooner, he said. ##Reopening## ##The South## America has an inequality problem and the\u00a0coronavirus crisis\u00a0is making it worse. The pandemic is leaving few people untouched, but America's weakest demographic groups are shouldering the worst burden through job losses and frontline work, against a backdrop of a\u00a0higher risk of infections\u00a0and lower savings. Lower earnings: The average black and Hispanic families are already bringing in less income, earning between 71 cents and 74 cents for each dollar earned by the median white family, according to a new\u00a0report from the JPMorgan Chase Institute. Fewer safety nets: Minority families also have a smaller buffer of liquid assets like savings and investments, meaning they have a much thinner cushion to fall back on to weather the storm of economic shocks. Vulnerable to layoffs: Black and Hispanic workers are also\u00a0more likely than white workers to be in jobs that pay by the hour, making them more susceptible to layoffs.\u00a0 A total of 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits\u00a0over the past month. \"As families face job loss and income uncertainty resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, this report shows that black and Hispanic families will bear the brunt of this economic crisis,\" said Diana Farrell, president and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. Related Coverage: America's black and Hispanic communities are bearing the brunt of the coronavirus crisis President\u00a0Trump\u00a0suggested Monday that there could be a Senate vote on a supplemental small business package Tuesday. \u201cHopefully, tomorrow the Senate\u2019s going to be able to vote. A lot of progress has been made on that, tremendous progress, great plan,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said. He said he hoped to have a vote in the Senate on Tuesday.\u00a0 Trump\u00a0said his administration is pushing for an additional $75 billion for hospitals\u00a0and\u00a0other healthcare providers in the deal. The Senate will try to pass a deal as soon as Tuesday afternoon, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Sources tell CNN\u00a0House Speaker Nancy\u00a0Pelosi\u00a0told House Democrats that a deal could be reached as soon as tonight\u00a0and\u00a0said if there's a deal tonight, the vote in the House will be Wednesday. If the deal comes together Tuesday, she said, the House vote will be Thursday.\u00a0 ##Stimulus## Individual missteps compounded upon each other when it mattered most put the United States well behind on Covid-19 testing. They included genuine fumbles, an overly restrictive testing policy and overly optimistic assurances. But now that it seems, hopefully, that the US may be getting the rate of Covid-19 infections under control, the lack of available testing seems likely to delay when the US can get back open for business. President Trump preaches from the White House about the sheer number of tests conducted, but it's the wrong metric in a country the size of the US, where more than 41,000 people have died so far. The countries that are ever so slowly climbing their way past coronavirus share one key trait: widespread testing. The US is testing about 150,000 people per day: Germany, with a smaller population, is testing 120,000 per day, according to The New York Times. Harvard researchers have argued that unless the US could be testing 500,000 per day by May 1, the economy won't be able to open up. Until the US has that and until it's possible to figure out where the virus is and where it is going, who has had it and whether the larger herd of Americans might be gaining some immunity, reopening the the country still seems a long way off.\u00a0 Or maybe not. Georgia will partially reopen: Gov. Brian Kemp is moving to open some businesses \u2014 gyms, hair salons, body art studios \u2014 as soon as this week, with restaurants and theaters set to follow April 27. Bars and nightclubs will stay closed. Cities cannot supersede Kemp's order, which will be implemented statewide and follows similar announcements in South Carolina and Tennessee after President Donald Trump told governors to call their own shots. Figure it out: Other governors are fuming at the Trump administration, which has essentially cut states loose to figure it out on their own. Maryland, for instance, is getting its own tests from South Korea after the state's first lady, who is originally from South Korea, hatched a side deal. Keep reading. ##Tests##"], "Language": false}
