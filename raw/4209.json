It's the first time we'll see\u00a0what the coronavirus crisis has done to the labor market. But, experts warn, we won't know the full effects until next month.\u00a0 Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus There are now more than 1 million cases of Covid-19 worldwide, but some fear that reporting issues and the presence of asymptomatic cases could mean the number is actually much, much higher. In the US, doctors on the White House's coronavirus task force say the numbers show some Americans aren't adhering to national guidelines about washing hands and staying home. So far, 6,000 people have died from coronavirus in the US, and officials have long warned that number could climb exponentially higher if precautions aren't taken. Japan is facing a similar problem, as citizens shirk\u00a0stay-at-home recommendations\u00a0to commute to work. China is opening back up, and starting next week people will be able to leave Wuhan, the city where the virus originated. However, citizens are concerned that the country's oft-questioned reporting and response methods may not prevent another wave of cases. Follow here for the latest. \u00a0 2. Health The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized the first antibody test that looks for a coronavirus response in blood. The\u00a0test can't identify fresh cases of the virus\u00a0but could help doctors understand how prevalent it\u00a0is by identifying past cases\u00a0that had few or no symptoms. Meanwhile, experts have told the White House the coronavirus may be spread via talking or even\u00a0breathing, as opposed to just\u00a0sneezing or coughing. Such a development could accelerate the government's plan to recommend face masks for public use. Speaking of equipment, President Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act, a wartime law that lets\u00a0the government\u00a0direct industrial production. In this case, it will be used to supply more ventilators and N95 masks to medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0 3. World economy\u00a0 The European Commission has proposed a new $109 billion\u00a0relief initiative to support the millions of Europeans left without a job because of the coronavirus crisis. The program would encourage employers in member states to\u00a0reduce employees' hours instead of laying them off. The EU's 27 members still need to vote on the measure. EU countries already have contributed billions of dollars to\u00a0buoy\u00a0business and workers, and\u00a0Europe's\u00a0central bank has\u00a0promised hundreds of billions more. Meanwhile, oil prices, which have been at historic lows, spiked as President Trump suggested massive production cuts and Saudi Arabia called for an emergency OPEC meeting to stabilize the market. That meeting will happen Monday and could signal a truce in the\u00a0brutal\u00a0oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that's dragged down the market.\u00a0 \u00a0 4. Election 2020 The Democratic National Convention has been pushed back from July to the week of August 17 in an inevitable but logistically nightmarish decision due to the coronavirus crisis. What hasn't been pushed back? Next week's Wisconsin primary. A\u00a0federal judge declined to postpone the Tuesday contest after the state's\u00a0Democratic Gov.\u00a0Tony Evers and its Republican-led state legislature refused to move or alter the election date\u00a0(even the Wisconsin Democratic Party and Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders said the contest should be postponed.) The judge did, however, extend\u00a0the deadline for absentee ballots in what could be one of many nationwide moves toward mail-in voting.\u00a0 5. Zoom Zoom, the video call service getting millions of people through their work-from-home routines, is facing serious security questions. The FBI has warned\u00a0of a new potential privacy and security concern called \"Zoombombing,\" wherein unknown people hijack calls and spew hateful language or share graphic images. Zoom\u00a0CEO Eric Yuan apologized for the privacy issues and said Zoom will\u00a0stop adding new features for the next 90 days to focus on fixing the problem.\u00a0The company will also release a transparency report to detail\u00a0requests for data or content from government authorities.
