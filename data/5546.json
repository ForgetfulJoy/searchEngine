He is an adult human man. And although Teie is most certainly not a cat, he makes some excellent music for felines.\n\nTeie is a cellist for the National Symphony Orchestra and a composer who lives in Washington, D.C. Teie\u2019s interest in composing for animals started with an interest in how humans hear music. In 2003, after many years as a professional classical musician, he learned that humans\u2019 emotional response to music is linked to sounds heard while in utero. \n\nAfter completing a book called \u201cHuman Music,\u201d he started composing for monkeys. Teie partnered with University of Wisconsin psychology professor Charles Snowdon to test two of his tracks with cotton-top tamarins. They loved the tunes, which had a higher pitch and faster pace than \u201chuman music\u201d because monkeys have higher-pitched voices and faster pulses.\n\nAccording to Teie\u2019s website, he \u201ccontends that every species has an intuitive biological response to sounds based on their brain development and vocalizations,\u201d so he sees the ultimate goal of writing music for our purring friends as communicating with them in something like their language. Using \u201cfeline-centric sounds,\u201d like bird noises and purring, Teie has brought tracks like \u201cKatey Moss Catwalk,\u201d \u201cTigerlilly and Mimi\u2019s Mewsical\u201d and \u201cPenelope\u2019s Nocturn\u201d to an entire audience. \n\nTeie says his music is especially relaxing for rescued kitties, who tend to be more stressed and may have experienced abuse, and his collaborator Snowdon concurs. What\u2019s more, scientists agree that Teie\u2019s tunes have an effect on cats. In an independent study, researchers from the University of Wisconsin concluded that \u201ccats showed a significant preference for and interest in [Teie\u2019s] species-appropriate music.\u201d A later study at Louisiana State University\u2019s School of Veterinary Medicine concluded that \u201ccat-specific music may benefit cats by decreasing the stress levels and increasing the quality of care in veterinary clinical settings.\u201d\n\nSo what do cat owners think of Teie\u2019s genre? Well, to fund the project, he launched a $20,000 Kickstarter campaign and ended up raising over $240,000. To date, he\u2019s completed two volumes of music for cats, which are available for purchase on the project\u2019s website and available to stream on various platforms.
