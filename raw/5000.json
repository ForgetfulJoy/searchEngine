And this month, we're getting two additions: the XPS 15 and XPS 17.  The Dell XPS 15 ($1,299.99; dell.com) and Dell XPS 17 ($1,499.99; dell.com), which are available for preorder, were built for creative vision.  The 15 features a 15.6-inch display, while the 17 boasts 17 inches. However, they both have a 4K UHD+ resolution, fit with Eyesafe technology and a touch display.

They also contain a number of ports for external devices, including an SD card reader, a headphone/microphone jack and Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C ports (two on the XPS 15 and four on the XPS 17). You'll also receive an adapter that can convert USB Type-C to HDMI, VGA, USB-A and Ethernet so you can connect printers, displays, projectors and external storage with ease. Both devices can house up to an 8-core 10th Generation Intel Core i9 processor, as well as up to 64GB of RAM. This powerful combination can handle serious creative tasks, from music production to 3D rendering.  To power the visual experience, the can opt for a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti 4GB.
