Follow the latest developments from around the globe here. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, there has been a 600% increase in demand for food bank assistance in South Florida, according to Feeding South Florida. To keep up with the demand, 45 members of the Florida National Guard have been deployed to help sort and pack family meal boxes and help with receiving and shipping docks. Feeding South Florida says it is serving about 265,000 people per week in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. ##South## \u00a0 The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019\u00a0inspector general announced a probe into the process used by the Food and Drug Administration to authorize coronavirus tests, according to a\u00a0post\u00a0on the IG\u2019s website.\u00a0 That process, known as \u201cEmergency Use Authorization,\u201d or EUA, has faced criticism from some lab directors and\u00a0personnel throughout the country who say they were ready to begin testing residents in their communities during the early stages of the virus\u2019 spread but couldn\u2019t due to regulations at the FDA, CNN previously\u00a0reported.\u00a0 The inspector general\u2019s office \u201cwill examine FDA's EUA processes and any challenges it may have faced regarding EUAs for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and serological tests for antibodies developed in response to the viral infection,\u201d the post said.\u00a0 While private and public labs have worked to ramp up testing capacity in recent months, coronavirus diagnostic testing initially lagged after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0released\u00a0a flawed test in February.\u00a0 Coronavirus is likely to keep spreading for at least another 18 months to two years \u2014 until 60% to 70% of the population\u00a0worldwide\u00a0has been infected, a team of longstanding pandemic experts predicted\u00a0Thursday in a new report. They recommended that the US prepare for a worst-case scenario that includes a second big wave of coronavirus infections in the fall and winter. Even in a best-case scenario, people will continue to die from the virus, they predicted. \u201cThis thing\u2019s not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70% of people,\u201d Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, told CNN. \u201cThe idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology.\u201d Osterholm has been writing about the risk of pandemics for 20 years and has advised several presidents. \u00a0 Because Covid-19 is new, no one has any immunity, the report said. \u201cThe length of the pandemic will likely be 18 to 24 months, as herd immunity gradually develops in the human population,\u201d the report states. Osterholm wrote the report along with Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch, who is also a top expert on pandemics; Dr. Kristine Moore, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist who is now medical director for CIDRAP; and historian John Barry, who wrote the 2004 book \u201cThe Great Influenza\u201d about the 1918 flu pandemic. \u00a0 The California Police Chiefs Association apologized Thursday after a memo sent to top law enforcement officers across the state incorrectly claimed\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom would order the closure of all the state's beaches and parks starting this Friday.\u00a0 Newsom on Thursday announced only beaches in Orange County would be closed, not all beaches statewide as the memo stated. \"Yesterday, the Executive Board of the California Police Chiefs Association was invited to participate on a conference call with public safety leaders from Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s Administration,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe call centered on issues with crowding at public beaches and related public health issues of COVID-19. In an ever-changing environment, we sent out information regarding decisions that were still evolving, which was regrettably shared outside of our police chief membership and we apologize for the undue concern that caused to the public, our colleagues, the Governor and his staff.\u201d The California Police Chiefs Association represents the state\u2019s municipal police chiefs whose agencies protect over 26 million Californians, it said. Asked about the police chiefs memo earlier Thursday, Newsom said, \u201cThat memo never got to me.\u201d \u201cWe just want to focus on where there\u2019s a problem in a smart, strategic way,\u201d\u00a0the governor\u00a0said, noting that he has been concerned about scenes showing crowds at beaches in recent days.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be heavy handed about these things,\u201d he said. ##West## Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office has directed the New York State Department of Corrections to begin the release of pregnant, non-violent, inmates who have six months or less remaining on their sentences, Melissa DeRosa, the secretary to the governor, said in a statement Thursday. \u200e\"Earlier today, we directed DOCCS to begin the release of pregnant non-violent offenders with six months or less remaining on their sentence. We will continue to\u00a0monitor\u00a0the Covid situation as it impacts every aspect of our state, including prisons, and make adjustments as\u00a0appropriate,\u201d DeRosa said. New York state had previously released inmates with less than 90 days on their sentence who were 55 or older and whose underlying crime was not a violent felony or a sex offense. New York had also lifted technical parole violation warrants for individuals who didn\u2019t pose a threat to public safety. ##Northeast## The United States' three biggest airlines -- American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines -- each said Thursday they will now require their passengers to wear masks.\u00a0 The Delta and United policy takes effect on Monday and the American policy takes effect a week later, on May 11.\u00a0 These airlines join JetBlue, Frontier, and Lufthansa, which have made similar announcements. This post was updated to reflect the United Airlines mask policy. President Trump discussed what aid to states and localities might look like as part of a phase four stimulus package.\u00a0 Trump was asked if he would support giving $1 trillion dollars to states and localities, a number floated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Trump said that Democrats want to help the states in the form of bailouts. He also said that it was states with Democratic governors that are asking for money.\u00a0 \u201cThey happen to be Democratic states. It's California, it\u2019s New York, it\u2019s Illinois, you start with those three. And the Republican states are in strong shape. You know, I don't know, is that luck or talent? Or is it just a different mentality? But the Republican run states are in strong shape,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Trump said that Democrats should have brought funding for states up earlier when Republicans wanted certain things. \u201cMaybe the Democrats should have brought this up earlier when we wanted certain things. And I said specifically, let's look at it later on down the road,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Democrats pushed to have funding for states included in the most recent stimulus package, but ultimately passed the stimulus without it. Pelosi has said that state and local funding will be included in the next stimulus package. \"We will have state and local and we will have it in a very significant way,\" Pelosi said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday.\u00a0 Trump said that Republicans are in a much better negotiating position on funding for states and if they agree to it, Republicans \u201chave to get something for it.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI think we want to take a little bit of a pause but if we do that we have to get something for it,\u201d Trump said. When asked about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s remarks that states should declare\u00a0bankruptcy, Trump said,\u00a0\u201cI have spoken to him about it very strongly and we are going to see what happens. We will take a little bit of a pause, we\u2019ll see what happens, but some states are in trouble,\u201d Trump said. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state's modified stay-at-home order will allow more flexibility \"where it is safe\" to do so. The order will go into effect Friday, May 1.  State parks, golf courses, retail stores, and garden centers are some of the few places that are reopening with strict social measures.\u00a0 Elective surgeries that have been put off due to the crisis can also now be scheduled in surgery centers and hospitals, Pritzker said. He also will require everyone in the state to wear a face mask when possible. \"Tomorrow\u00a0will be the first day where adults and any children over the age of two and everyone medically able to tolerate a face covering will be required to wear one in public places where they can't maintain a 6-foot social distance,\" he said. ##Midwest## Michigan State Police says claims that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was trapped inside the Capitol building by demonstrators protesting against her stay-at-home order are false. Roughly 400 to 700 people descended on the state Capitol today, according to Michigan State Police. The capitol was open to the public today, but due to social distancing rules in place, only 275 individuals were allowed inside at a time, with certain sections of the building being closed off, according to Lt. Brian Oleksyk. Oleksyk said it was a very peaceful protest, \u201cthey were chanting peacefully and that was it.\u201d State Police made one arrest, which took place outside of the Capitol, where one protester had assaulted another, Oleksyk said. All protesters had dispersed by 5 p.m., as had most of the police detail that was there to assist with the crowd.\u00a0 Both the House and Senate were in session Thursday, according to the Detroit Free Press.\u00a0 Michigan Sen. Dayna Polehanki had tweeted this afternoon, saying that protesters were directly above her, \u201cmen with rifles yelling at us.\u201d \u201cSome of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them. I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today,\u201d Polehanki\u2019s tweeted. Michigan Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich\u2019s said while he encourages \"people to voice their disagreements with their government,\" this is not what happened today. \"This protest wasn\u2019t about the stay-at-home order, it was an opportunity for a small group of folks \u2013 very few of whom were engaging in social distancing or wearing masks \u2013 to show off their swastika posters, confederate flags, nooses hanging from cars and signs calling for murder. Threatening Capitol police, staff, press, and elected members is not how we do business here in Michigan,\" Ananich said in a statement. \"We support robust debate and we support both the first and second amendments. We will not condone physical intimidation or causing chaos in the middle of a global pandemic.\u201d Watch: ##Midwest## President Trump said he would have no problem wearing a face mask when he travels to Arizona next week, adding it will depend on the conditions on the ground.\u00a0 \u201cAs far as where I am going in Arizona, I\u2019m gonna have to look at the climate. I\u2019d have no problem wearing a mask.\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cI'm supposed to make a speech, I just don't know, should I speak in a mask? You are going to have to tell me if that is politically correct, I don\u2019t know. If it is, I\u2019ll speak in a mask.\"\u00a0 Trump said he doesn\u2019t wear a face mask in the White House because he is in large rooms and is socially distanced from others. However, Trump has repeatedly been surrounded by large groups of people in close proximity, at his multiple press briefings in the small White House briefing room and at Thursday's event when he signed the proclamation declaring Older Americans Month. This is a reversal from Trump's previous comments, when he said last month he wouldn't wear a face mask himself, saying it was impossible to imagine greeting world leaders in the Oval Office with his face covered.\u00a0 \"I don't think I'm going to be doing it,\" he said, suggesting it was hard to envision such a thing in the Oval Office: \"Wearing a face\u00a0mask\u00a0as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens \u2014 I just don't see it.\"\u00a0 Some Mississippi casinos could reopen in time for Memorial Day weekend, Gov. Tate Reeves said during a news conference on Thursday.\u00a0 The state\ufffd\ufffds casinos have been closed since mid-March. Reeves said he was confident that by Memorial Day some of the facilities would be open, but it would not be the exact same way it was before the pandemic. Reeves said that he is working with the venues to ensure social distancing in a way that is safe for Mississippi. ##Reopening## Orange County officials are lashing out at California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s order to close beaches in the area. \"(It's) a clear example of unnecessary government overreach. His actions are arbitrary and capricious and is an act of retribution against Orange County,\" said Michelle Steele, a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. \u201cThis is not acceptable and there is no rational basis for this action.\u00a0 Orange County officials learned about the order just 15 minutes before the governor\u2019s announcement, said Don Wagner, a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Both Wagner and Steele blamed \"misleading photographs\" for the decision. \u201cThe telephoto lens distorted what was going on on the beach,\" Wagner said. \u201cWe know that because we\u2019ve seen photos from other angles.\u201d \u201cThe photographs I saw, quite honestly, are a stark contrast to what I believe the governor is acting on,\u201d Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes said, adding \u201cI have no desire to enforce any aspect of that through arrest.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI would urge the governor to trust the locals,\u201d Wagner said. ##West## There is no food shortage in Mississippi due to the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Tate Reeves said\u00a0in a news conference Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cI want to be clear. Very, very clear: We are not at immediate risk of any shortage,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cYou do not need to hoard. You do not need to empty the shelves of your local grocery store. That will do more harm than good. You will get what you need.\u201d Mississippi farmers, ranchers, truckers and those working at meat processing plants are making sure the food supply chain is intact, he said. \"No one should ever have to worry about keeping food on the table,\" Reeves tweeted.\u00a0 Mississippi has reported 6,815 positive cases and 261 deaths due to the coronavirus, said Dr. Thomas Dobbs with the Mississippi State Health Department.\u00a0 ##South##\u00a0 \u00a0 The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said more than 120 employees have tested positive for Covid-19 at Triumph Foods pork processing plant in St. Joseph.  The announcement comes after the state health department partnered with local health officials to offer testing to more than 2,000 employees at the plant earlier this week. \u201cWe appreciate the willingness from employees of Triumph Foods to be tested and the collaboration with local health care providers to help prevent further spread of COVID-19 in this community,\u201d DHSS Director Dr. Randall Williams said in a statement. \u201cPartnering with providers and local health departments to test people, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, is part of our \u201cbox-in\u201d strategy with this virus moving forward.\u201d Employees with positive results are being notified by the city's Health Department and will be told to isolate.  At the request of the city's Health Department, the state is sending support staff to assist with contact tracing efforts and more testing is to be expected as close contacts of patients are notified.  ##Midwest## Is there someone that you\u2019d like to thank and show your appreciation toward during the coronavirus pandemic?  Send us your story, telling us who they are and why you\u2019re thankful.  Please include your name and phone number, and we may be in touch with you about featuring your message of thanks on CNN. Former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said Thursday that some activities can resume around the country because \"we\u2019re basically over the worst of this phase of the pandemic.\"\u00a0 \u201cThings are getting better and we can gradually resume some activities,\u201d Frieden said at a coronavirus media briefing sponsored by the Aspen Institute.\u00a0 \u201cOn the other hand, we\u2019re getting back, not to normal, we\u2019re going to get back to a new normal. And that\u2019s going to include physical distancing, hand sanitizer, face masks and avoidance \u2026 of large gatherings where many people come together in one place.\"\u00a0 When it comes to summer vacations, beach trips are still a go, Frieden said. Social distancing is still necessary, though, he said. \u201cYes, in fact, outdoors places are much safer than indoor places. Beaches, parks, bicycling, hiking. These are great things to do. They\u2019re great for the spirit, and outdoors is a great way to reduce risk,\" he added. \u201cNow to have a 100,000 people on a crowded beach, that\u2019s a little different, but with sensible precautions, the great outdoors is a great way forward.\u201d ##Reopening## Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont outlined the industries that could reopen on May 20. He said at a news conference today that state officials were looking into how to safely open outdoor only restaurants, outdoor zoos and outdoor museums, university research programs, hair and nail services and the remaining retail businesses that are currently been deemed as nonessential. Some offices would also open but individuals would be encouraged to continue to work from home when possible. Outdoor recreation such as camping and mountain biking would also reopen.\u00a0 The recommendations are being made based on industry types that can be reopened safely and where social distancing can be maintained, Lamont said. Ultimately it will be up to each individual business to decide if it feels comfortable reopening on May 20, Lamont stressed. Lamont said he has not made a decision yet on schools \u2013 which are currently closed through May 20. He said he will provide an update on schools \u201cearly next week.\u201d ##Northeast## ##Reopening## Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has shared a series of rules businesses like barbershops and hair salons must follow before before reopening May 6. The guidelines apply to \"close contact personal services\" in 89 of the state's 95 counties, according to the guidelines shared by the state online. Some of the guidelines include: Verbal and temperature screenings for all employees\nPracticing social distancing\nIncreased hygiene practices like changing protective garments on a regular basis\nWashing hands between each customer\nEmployees must wear a cloth face covering Other protocols that businesses will need to observe include not offering any self-serve food or beverages and prohibiting congregation. The new guidelines limit certain services that require the removal of face coverings. Services like beard shaving/trimming and facials will not be allowed in phase one, the guidelines state. ##Reopening## ##South## President Trump outlined additional steps the administration will take to protect seniors from coronavirus, saying the Federal Emergency Management Agency will send supplemental shipments of personal protective equipment to all 15,400 Medicaid and Medicare certified nursing homes in America. He also said that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will provide states with $81 million dollars from the CARES Act to increase inspections of nursing homes. Trump announced that a new rule will be finalized this week requiring information about coronavirus cases in nursing homes to be reported directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and testing data be posted online. The new rule will also require nursing homes to report cases to residents and their family members.\u00a0 The President also announced the formation of the \u201cCoronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes.\u201d Trump said the commission will be made up of leading industry experts, doctors and scientists, resident and patient advocates and others. The commission will convene in May and issue recommendations for additional steps to protect seniors, he added. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is launching a campaign to distribute face masks to North Carolina\u2019s energy and food supply workers, Michael Sprayberry, the state  director of Emergency Management, announced Thursday. Sprayberry said that FEMA will ship the masks directly to companies for workers who have jobs where social distancing is difficult. North Carolina Emergency Management will also receive an additional 149,000 cloth masks to distribute to workers in the food supply chain. JBS has announced that it is partially reopening its plant in Worthington, Minnesota, \"to provide producers with a humane euthanasia option for market hogs,\" the company said in a statement today. A small staff of \"approximately 10 to 20 team members\" will facilitate the process of putting down hogs that farmers are unable to keep and feed on their farms, the company statement said.\u00a0JBS anticipates that approximately 13,000 hogs could be euthanized per day, the statement said.\u00a0 Hog carcasses will be rendered, sent to landfills, composted or buried, the statement added. \u201cNone of us want to euthanize hogs, but our producers are facing a terrible, unprecedented situation,\u201d Bob Krebs, president of JBS USA Pork, said in the statement. Some background: JBS announced the plant's closure last Monday over Covid-19 concerns. The\u00a0Worthington\u00a0plant employs more than 2,000 people and processes 20,000 hogs per day, according to an earlier a company statement. Minnesota Congressman Collin Peterson said all plant employees were tested for Covid-19 over the past weekend. He said\u00a0\"close to 500\" tested positive. ##Midwest## Los Angeles County will not provide coronavirus testing for low risk and asymptomatic residents, according to Health Services Director Christina Ghaly. Ghaly said the focus will instead be on people living in institutional settings like nursing homes, homeless shelters and jails. That includes both people with symptoms and those without. Ghaly acknowledged the psychological reassurance of knowing whether you are infected, but warned that a test captures only one moment in time.  \u201cA negative test one day, doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be infected the next day,\u201d Ghaly said. Those who wouldn\u2019t necessarily qualify for testing in Los Angeles County can still go to the city to be tested. People showing symptoms will be prioritized. ##West## ##Testing## Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine confirmed today that the state\u2019s stay-at-home order, which was set to expire May 1, will be extended with certain exceptions. \u201cSo, the decision has been made, I made the decision to have the stay-at-home order still in effect,\u201d DeWine said. The governor said people can certainly continue to go to the grocery store, they can meet with their own family in a home, they can take walks, and \u201cthey can do a number of different things.\u201d \u201cThe social distancing is really the key to about everything, and people just keeping that distance. And that\u2019s what we need to continue to do as we move to get back to work,\u201d DeWine added. ##Midwest## Utah state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said that the state saw a 3.5% growth rate of Covid-19 cases in the past day, up to 4,495 total cases statewide.\u00a0 The total number of hospitalizations rose slightly to 383, up 13 from the day before\u00a0but the state is not reporting any additional deaths over the past day. As of Thursday, 45 people have died in Utah. Some more context: Earlier today, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert issued an executive order that will place Utah under a lower, \u201cmoderate risk\u201d protocol beginning on midnight May 1, according to a statement on the governor\u2019s website.\u00a0 Restaurants and bars will open for dine-in services but with \u201cstrict requirements.\u201d The requirements include limiting tables to groups of 10, enforcing social distancing, and face coverings for staff.\u00a0 Dunn said that there will be some individuals who need to continue to practice extra precautions to prevent infection. These individuals include those over the age of 65, individuals at long-term care facilities and those who have underlying health conditions.\u00a0 ##Reopening## ##Midwest## Tyson Foods said it will temporarily stop operations at its Dakota City, Nebraska, beef facility to complete a deep cleaning of the entire plant, according to a statement released by the company. The statement said the facility will stop operations between\u00a0May 1 through May 4. \u201cTeam member safety has and continues to be top priority for us and we\u2019re grateful for our team members and their critical role in helping us fulfill, to the best of our ability, our commitment to helping feed people in our community and across the nation,\u201d said Shane Miller, the senior vice president and general manager of beef enterprise at Tyson Fresh Meats. Tyson said the plant is one of the largest beef processing plant in the country, employing about 4,300 people and producing enough beef to feed about 1.8 million people a day. \"However, with increased absenteeism over the last few weeks, the company has scaled back production,\" the statement said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will coordinate the shipment of personal protective equipment to more than 15,000 nursing homes across the country starting next week, if not sooner, according to a document obtained by CNN. The shipment includes \u201cmore than 7.1 million surgical masks, nearly 32.3 million gloves, more than 922,000 goggles and other eye protection, and nearly 9.7 million gowns.\u201d  The equipment is only being shipped to Medicaid and Medicare-certified nursing homes based on input from the American Health Care Association. The document, dated April 24, notes that facilities may not receive notification prior to the shipment arriving, citing a large number of nursing homes.  \u201cHowever, as possible, FEMA will provide notification to a state prior to shipments arriving at their Medicaid/ Medicare-certified facilities,\u201d it notes. The first shipments are targeted for New York City metro area and northern New Jersey. The rest will be sent to other hotspots around the country. Shipments are expected to be completed in mid-June, the document says. North Carolina reported 561 new positive coronavirus tests on Thursday, the state\u2019s largest daily increase since the pandemic began, according to Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Cohen explained that the increase is due to an increase in testing and that overall trends remain positive. North Carolina processed 6,000 tests on Wednesday. \u201cWe remain optimistic that trends will be stable enough to move into phase one next week,\u201d Cohen asserted in a Thursday press conference, referencing the governor\u2019s three-phase plan for reopening the state. North Carolina has reported 10,509 total positive coronavirus cases and 378 deaths. ##South## Little League International has canceled the upcoming Little League World Series. The World Series was originally scheduled for August 20 through 30. The organization\u2019s Board of Directors canceled the regional qualifying events as well, citing public health concerns with coronavirus. This is the first time the event won\u2019t be held since the tournament began in 1947. \u201cThis is a heartbreaking decision for everyone at Little League International, but more so for those millions of Little Leaguers who have dreamt of one day playing in one of our seven World Series events,\" Stephen D. Keener, Little League president and CEO said in a statement. Little League International says it will donate about $1.2 million to help fund local Little League programs as they continue their operations. Connecticut is on its eighth\u00a0consecutive day of hospitalizations decreasing across the state, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Thursday. The state saw a decrease of 41 hospitalizations from the previous day, bringing the total hospitalizations to 1,650.\u00a0 One of the state\u2019s criteria for initial reopening in the state is a 14-day decline of hospitalizations, Lamont said. There are at least 27,700 cases of coronavirus in the state and at least 2,257 people have died from the virus. The state has continued to increase its testing, which is a requirement on the state\u2019s list of criteria for reopening. At least 97,133 tests have been performed so far. ##Northeast## Frontier\u00a0is the second US airline to require passengers to wear masks or face coverings on flights beginning May 8. \"This new measure is aligned with CDC recommendations and those of many municipalities within the US that include wearing a face covering when out in public,\" Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said in a press release. Customers must wear masks when they're around Frontier ticket counters and gate areas, as well as during flights. Young children will be exempt from the policy. JetBlue\u00a0announced a\u00a0similar policy on Tuesday. On Monday, American Airlines said its flight attendants would be\u00a0required to wear face masks\u00a0during every mainline and regional flight starting May 1. US stocks finished the last trading day of the month in negative territory.\u00a0Another bleak look at the US labor market and inaction from the European Central Bank weighed on investor sentiment. Here's where things ended up: The Dow closed 1.2%, or 288 points, lower.\nThe S&P 500 finished down 0.9%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite ended down 0.3%. Despite the pessimistic economic data showing the disruption the coronavirus pandemic is causing the economy, it was a historically good month for stocks. The Dow climbed 11.1%, while the S&P 500 added 12.7% in April. It was the best monthly gain since January 1987 for both indexes. The Nasdaq Composite gained 15.4% for the month, its best performance since June 2000. Health Department officials in Rock Island County, Illinois have identified a new Covid-19 outbreak at Tyson's meat-packing plant in Joslin, Illinois.\u00a0 At least 92 confirmed cases and two deaths have been tied to the plant there, according to the health department's website. According to Nita Ludwig with the Rock Island County Health Department, the infectious disease team has been working with each patient to minimize the number of infections outside the plant with contact tracing.\u00a0\u00a0 Tyson Foods put up plastic barriers between line workers and staggered shifts and schedules to reduce the number of employees near each other.\u00a0 ##Midwest## Eliza Paris\u2019 treatment for appendix cancer was disrupted when she was diagnosed with coronavirus. \u201cIt was a very tough fight,\u201d Paris told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin. \u201cYou know, I thought I'd been through everything that could be thrown at me with cancer and then Covid came in and it's just a whole other battle... it's so unknown.\" She said \u201cnot being able to catch your breath is a scary feeling,\u201d and she was unable to have her support system around her because she was isolated. Paris had to stop chemotherapy in order to be treated for coronavirus and said that knowing that there was a risk of the tumors growing was \u201creally upsetting\u201d but that she trusted her oncologist. \u201cShe knew that my body had to get stronger to fight the cancer,\" she said. Paris said she\u2019s now ready to fight cancer after beating coronavirus and that it gives her a little more determination. \u201cIf I can beat Covid then I can take down cancer as well,\u201d she said. Watch more: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said today the state has 2,633 new cases of Covid-19 for a total of 118,652.  The governor also reported 460 new deaths for a total of 7,228 deaths. Murphy said he had a \"productive and broad discussion\" earlier today with President Trump regarding Covid-19.\u00a0Murphy went on to thank the administration for all their help.  He said the state will receive 550,000 new Covid-19 tests and 750,000 swabs from the federal government. The Trump administration will also send PPE to 358 nursing homes in New Jersey, the governor said.\u00a0 ##Northeast##\u00a0 Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she hopes the state will be able to open school in September\u00a0 Raimondo has asked the presidents of the state's 20 colleges to submit plans on how they can safely reopen in the fall.\u00a0 The presidents have been given five or more weeks to develop their plans. Raimondo said that each of the colleges have been given guidelines on \u201cwhat a safe plan has to look like; and then they are going to come back to us and we will work with them\u2026to get that plan in shape over the summer so that in the fall, hopefully, they\u2019ll be able to allow students to come back.\u201d More cleaning, more testing, mask wearing and probably not big lecture halls is what students could possibly expect, Raimondo said.\u00a0 ##Northeast## Arkansas will lift restrictions on gyms, fitness centers, and indoor athletic facilities so they can resume operations beginning next Monday, May 4, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced on Thursday. The governor outlined limitations and requirements for the facilities upon reopening including: No entry for people who recently traveled to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, New Orleans, or overseas\nNo entry for people with a fever, symptoms, or recent contact with a Covid patient or anyone with compromised immune systems or chronic diseases\nTemperature checks for staff\nFace coverings for staff and patrons, except while actively exercising\nNo pools, spas, showers or saunas\nHand sanitizer must be available\nEquipment must be sanitized after each use\n12-foot distancing while working out, during training sessions, and for classes\nNo personal contact There are at least 3,255 cases of coronavirus in Arkansas. At least 61 people have died from the virus.\u00a0 ##South## A stay-at-home order in Louisiana has been extended until May 15, Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a news conference Thursday. He said he signed the executive order earlier today. Edwards, who met with President Trump this week, said the President was \"extremely supportive\" of the efforts made by the state to combat coronavirus. The governor said they discussed his plan to move forward with reopening efforts using the guidelines provided by the White House. Federal officials were paying close attention to the steep increase and cases in the state weeks ago and were worried the state might not be able to handle the situation, Edwards said.\u00a0 ##South## Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he is signing a new executive order that extends the state's stay-at-home order but also loosens some restrictions on businesses. Walz said that the order is extended until May 18. The governor also \"strongly\" encouraged Minnesotans to wear masks outside the home. Starting on Monday, retail businesses may begin to offer curbside pickup, Walz announced. Businesses are required to develop and post a plan on safe operation, use contactless payments, and follow social distanciung and minimize contact with customers, Walz explained. Walz said that this loosening will\u00a0put 30,000 Minnesotans back to work. Steve Grove,\u00a0Commissioner for the Department of Employment and Economic Development,\u00a0noted that salons and barbershops cannot provide\u00a0services,\u00a0but may conduct retail sales.\u00a0 \"Under no circumstances can customers enter a business when they're there to pick something up,\" Grove added. ##Midwest## At least 388 poultry plant employees have tested positive for Covid-19, and one poultry plant employee has died, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.\u00a0 There are an estimated 16,500 poultry industry workers across Georgia.\u00a0 The Georgia Department of Public Health said that these are \u201creasonable\u201d estimates based on hospital data and information from the poultry plants.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is important to note that many of those who were infected have recovered and returned to work,\u201d Nancy Nydam, director of communications with the Georgia Department of Public Health told CNN.\u00a0 \u201cThe biggest challenge for these employees is the community widespread transmission in the areas where they live, the lack of education about Covid-19, and reluctance to change behaviors. Many employees live in multi-generational homes with large numbers of family members. They have no place to self-isolate if they are sick with Covid-19 and the whole family ends up getting sick,\" Nydam said. ##South## New York City has had at least 12,571 confirmed coronavirus deaths and 5,295 probable coronavirus deaths,\u00a0according to the city website. The New York City Health Department defines probable deaths as people who did not have a positive Covid-19 laboratory test, but their death certificate lists as the cause of death \u201cCOVID-19\u201d or an equivalent. The total number of confirmed coronavirus deaths and probable coronavirus deaths in New York City is 17,866. There have been 162,212 coronavirus cases in the city and approximately 41,648 people have been hospitalized, according to the city. ##Northeast## Representatives for the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) said they continue to see supply chain issues with testing supplies.\u00a0 \u201cWe do our best to plan to have enough supplies to test for the next two weeks,\u201d Megan Crumpler, laboratory director in California\u2019s Orange County Public Health Laboratory, said at a press briefing Thursday.  \u201cI have referred to it as a game of whack-a-mole, where you are constantly\u2026 trying to figure out which test kit or which extraction kit you're going to be able to get that week and moving forward with that,\" Crumpler said. Scott Becker, the Chief Executive Officer at APHL said he has seen progress with regards to swabs, specifically.\u00a0 \u201cMy understanding is that FEMA is now delivering swabs to the state and the states are responsible for organizing; again according to whatever their plan is for testing to ensure that those swabs get where they need to go,\" he said. Becker said going forward, the supply issue is \u201cfirst and foremost our biggest concern.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhatever scheme is developed out of the White House Task Force has to absolutely ensure that Public Health Laboratories have the necessary support that they need.\u00a0We've been working with them and with CDC, of course throughout this to share what are the instruments and what are the needs of the public health labs \u2013\u2013\u00a0so supplies are first and foremost,\" Becker said. NASCAR has announced that it will begin holding races in mid-May starting with events at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina.  Fans will not be allowed at the events. Darlington will hold three separate events between May 17-20; two NASCAR Cup Series races and a NASCAR Xfinity Series race.  NASCAR will then host four events in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the Charlotte Motor Speedway from May 24-27. NASCAR says it has implemented a comprehensive health and safety plan that includes mandated use of personal protective equipment throughout the events and health screenings for all individuals prior to entering the facility, while inside the facility and exiting the facility. \u201cNASCAR will return in an environment that will ensure the safety of our competitors, officials and all those in the local community. We thank local, state and federal officials and medical experts, as well as everyone in the industry, for the unprecedented support in our return to racing, and we look forward to joining our passionate fans in watching cars return to the track,\" Steve O\u2019Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer, said in a statement. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today a temporary pause on state and local beaches in Orange County. He said the beaches may open very quickly if the framework and guidelines allow.\u00a0 Newsom has consistently reiterated his disappointment and frustration with beachgoers, chiding them for crowding the coast. He noted that only about 5% of beaches in the state actually presented an issue with crowding. The city council in Newport Beach, California, snubbed the governor\u2019s reproach and voted Tuesday to step up enforcement of physical distancing and keep beaches open. While the governor is cracking down on beaches, access is being granted for other outdoor spaces. The amended stay-home order loosens up restrictions on hiking, golfing, tennis and other outdoor activities. \u201cThe only thing we don\u2019t want you to do is linger, in ways where you\u2019re mixing,\u201d Newsom said. Newsom addressed a law enforcement memo disseminated widely last night that indicated all California beaches would be closed. He said the memo never got to him. The governor went on to say that he just wants \"to focus on where there\u2019s a problem.. in a smart, strategic way.\" \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be heavy-handed about these things,\u201d he said. ##West## Scott Becker, chief executive officer at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said clinicians across the United States are bracing for the long haul as coronavirus testing, surveillance and contact tracings ramps up.\u00a0 \u201cEarly on I thought it was a marathon, I now think it's more of an ultra-marathon with a triathlon attached to it,\u201d Becker said during a Thursday webinar. \u201cPublic health lab scientists across the country are really hometown heroes, and they are making a difference.\" Megan Crumpler, laboratory director at California\u2019s Orange County Public Health Laboratory, said looking forward, \u201cwe will do what we are doing now which is outbreak investigations and move into more of our surveillance troll, similar to what we do for influenza.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Becker added public health labs will play an important role in contact tracing. \u201cThere's a huge effort in every state to develop contact tracing teams, and the public health laboratory will be one of the major players in terms of doing the testing for those outbreaks that they find,\" Becker said. \"It's like our usual work but on steroids.\"\u00a0 Following reports that Brian Kemp will\u00a0lift Georgia\u2019s shelter-in-place order\u00a0at midnight Thursday, Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Nikema Williams released a statement saying the decision is \"reckless and irresponsible.\" \u201cAgainst the advice of public health experts, and against the will of the majority of Georgians, Brian Kemp is playing a dangerous game by ending Georgia\u2019s shelter in place order before it is safe,\" the statement said. \"It is reckless and irresponsible for Kemp to use Georgians as the guinea pigs in a public health experiment that will go wrong. Today\u2019s decision will have consequences \u2014 for our overworked health systems, for our struggling essential workers, and for our lives,\" the statement added. Some background: Kemp was one of the last governors to enact shelter-in-place restrictions, only doing so after admitting he\u00a0didn\u2019t understand basic facts\u00a0about the coronavirus.  Earlier this week, his administration admitted that Georgia has\u00a0failed to meet federal guidelines\u00a0for reopening the state, after reopening bowling alleys and hair salons\u00a0well before the data suggests\u00a0a lasting decline in coronavirus cases. Covid-19 has ravaged communities across the state, particularly in southwest Georgia, which has had some of the highest coronavirus rates in the country. The virus is taking a disproportionate toll on black Georgians \u2014 a\u00a0recent study shows that 80% of hospitalized coronavirus patients in Georgia were African American. ##South## ##Reopening## A sixth JBS USA meatpacking employee died Wednesday night during an outbreak at the company's Greeley, Colorado, plant, according to United Food & Commercial Workers (UFCW) union president Kim Cordova. \"We lost another of our UFCW Local 7 members,\" Cordova tells CNN.  Cordova did not identify the employee, but said\u00a0\"he was born in 1954 and had worked at the plant since 1989.\" ##West## Mount Sinai Health System officials are tentatively planning to close New York City's Central Park field hospital in May, a source familiar with the Mt. Sinai Health Systems operations tells CNN.\u00a0 As of today, there are 18 patients at the field hospital, and Mount Sinai officials are tentatively planning to close it the second week of May if the need continues to fall. About the field hospital: Central Park's East Meadow on the Upper East Side was converted into a 68-bed field hospital designed as a respiratory care unit.\u00a0It took its first patients at the beginning of April. ##Northeast## Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has signed an executive order declaring that the state's shelter-in-place mandate will expire at 11:59 p.m. tonight. The governor issued a statement urging Georgians to continue to stay home \"whenever possible.\" Here's what Kemp said: \"Tonight at 11:59 PM, the statewide shelter in place order for most Georgians will expire. However, moving forward, I am urging Georgians to continue to stay home whenever possible. I want to thank the people of our great state who heeded public health advice, afforded us time to bolster our healthcare infrastructure, and flattened the curve. We were successful in these efforts, but the fight is far from over.\" ##South## Juan Desmarais, a barbershop owner in California, is planning to reopen his business this week, defying the state\u2019s stay-at-home orders. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to bail us out and my barbers\u2019 livelihoods as well as my own livelihood is at stake here,\u201d Desmarais told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin. When pressed by Baldwin about risking punishment and fines, Desmarais said, \"I'm not going to live in fear.\u00a0It's not American.\" \u00a0 He added that he would take sanitary precautions like scheduling appointments one-on-one and having barbers wear masks and gloves.  Desmarais said he believes it is his constitutional right to pursue his life and that officials are basically telling him to \u201cwalk away\u201d from his business with the restrictions that are in place. \u201cI\u2019d rather get citations, do as much as I can, work and hustle, not ask the government for a single penny and if I flop, I\u2019d rather flop working than flop just sitting there letting them take away my rights, take away my businesses and take away the legacy I\u2019m going to leave my children,\u201d he said. A small rural county on the northeastern edge of California plans to reopen businesses, schools and churches starting Friday as well.  ##Reopening## ##West## Pennsylvania has reported 1,397 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the statewide total to 45,763 cases across all 67 counties, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine announced Thursday. Of those total number of cases, 2,753 are health care workers and 8,112 are associated with Pennsylvania\u2019s 468 long-term care living facilities, which include nursing homes and personal care homes. There are 2,706 patients currently hospitalized across the state and 562 patients are currently on a ventilator or breathing machine.\u00a0 There have been 2,292 coronavirus-related deaths in the state and to date, all of the deaths have been in adult patients, Levine said.  ##Northeast## There are at least\u00a01,053,036\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and at least\u00a061,547\u00a0people have died from the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the country. On Thursday, Johns Hopkins reported\u00a013,127\u00a0new cases and\u00a0581\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases.\u00a0 \u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0is\u00a0wearing a mask today as he tours a GM ventilator facility in Kokomo, Indiana. Earlier this week, Pence faced widespread criticism for not wearing a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic, which has a policy that everyone must wear masks.  Today, his wife, Karen Pence, claimed he only found out the Mayo Clinic\u2019s policy after leaving \u2013 although it was reported his staff was aware. ##Midwest## In defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom's stay-at-home order, a small rural county on the northeastern edge of California plans to reopen businesses, schools and churches starting Friday, according to the county's Facebook page.\u00a0\u00a0 Bordering Oregon, Modoc County is the first in the state to openly reject Newsom's continued restrictions to stem the spread of the coronavirus.  Modoc County is one of the least populated counties in the state with less than 9,000 residents.\u00a0It\u2019s Board of Supervisors approved the reopening plan earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The plan posted on the county\u2019s\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0says \u201crestaurants and bars may open inside dining but may only be at half capacity.\u201d\u00a0 The plan says residents must also adhere to social distancing guidelines and there can be \u201cno large gatherings where proper social distancing cannot be maintained.\u201d Local officials say they feel comfortable with the reopening since there have been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the county. \u201cWe submitted plans and letters to the governor six days ago and we have not heard a word from him,\u201d\u00a0said Ned Coe, vice chair of Modoc County Board of Supervisors. \u201cBusinesses will be proceeding to open tomorrow,\" Coe said. Newsom hasn\u2019t publicly commented on Modoc\u2019s move and it\u2019s unclear if the county\u2019s reopening will cause any friction between state and local authorities. Rural communities like Modoc are increasingly at odds with Newsom\u2019s order. On Tuesday, business operators representing other rural parts of the state were joined by local politicians to publicly ask the Newsom to begin lifting restrictions. ##West## ##Reopening## San Diego Mayor Kevin Falconer is criticizing Gov. Gavin Newsom's potential decision to close California beaches and parks. Newsom has made no secret of his disdain for crowds of beachgoers amid the pandemic and is expected to announce the statewide closure later today. Meanwhile, Falconer said a statewide closure of beaches \u201csends the wrong message.\u201d \u201cSan Diegans have been following the rules set by our public health officials and lifeguards since beaches reopened this week. A sudden state ban on every single beach \u2013 regardless of the facts \u2013 sends the wrong message to regions where people are acting responsibly,\u201d Falconer tweeted. San Diego is one of the areas Newsom has praised for adhering to physical distancing guidelines. Read Falconer's tweet: ##West## ##Reopening## The West Virginia Department of Health and Humane Resources is compiling data on how the coronavirus has impacted the African American community, DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch said at a news conference Thursday The information should be available to the public by Monday, Crouch said. The data will include the location of individuals, numbers of positive cases and number of deaths in the community, he said. The World Health Organization (WHO) says 102\u00a0potential\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0vaccines\u00a0are in development around the world, according to documents posted on the organization\u2019s website.\u00a0 Eight of the potential vaccines are approved for clinical trials. That is up from seven vaccines four days ago. The additional group is from China, but it is unclear if they have started\u00a0trials on\u00a0human study subjects \u2013 the other seven have.  Of the groups approved\u00a0for clinical trials on humans, four are from China, one is from England, one is American and another is a combined American and European\u00a0group.  The American National Institutes of Health (NIH) trial was the first to start testing in human trial subjects on March 16.  Bill Gates has warned of the threat from a global pandemic for years. He has now become a leading voice on how to fight it.  Gates, the\u00a0Microsoft founder whose foundation has studied pandemics for years, will join Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta tonight at 8 p.m. ET for a CNN town hall. They'll take a look at what lies ahead as some states begin to ease restrictions. But first, here's a look at four things Gates recommends to \"get back to normal\":\u00a0 Testing: Gates suggests various strategies to advance current testing methods including at-home test kits and consistent standards about who can get tested.\nContact Tracing: Gates suggests following Germany\u2019s model. Interview everyone who tests positive and use a database to make sure someone follows up with all their contacts. However, this relies on the infected person reporting their contacts accurately and requires a lot of staff to follow up with everyone in person.\u00a0Gates suggest technology may be more adept at this, such as apps that help you remember where you\u2019ve been or using cell phones.\nEffective Treatment: Right now, there is no treatment for Covid-19. On Wednesday, Fauci expressed optimism about an experimental drug called remdesevir, which is still in the trial phase. Other drugs like hydroxychloroquine have received a lot of attention but are still being studied. Treatments such as convalescent plasma \u2013 drawing blood from patients who have recovered from Covid-19, making sure it is free of the coronavirus and other infections, and giving the plasma and the antibodies it contains to sick people \u2013 look promising. But there is no magic drug experts can fully support yet.\nA Vaccine: Many countries and companies around the world are working at break-neck speed to develop a vaccine faster \u2014 and there are promising signs. Gates is particularly excited about pursuing a new approach called an \u201cRNA vaccine.\u201d He said: \u201cUnlike a flu shot, which contains fragments of the influenza virus so your immune system can learn to attack them, an RNA vaccine gives your body the genetic code needed to produce viral fragments on its own,\u201d So, once your body senses traces of the infection, it attacks it.\u00a0 You can read Gates' full memo on what needs to be done for us to safely lift coronavirus restrictions and get life back to normal\u00a0here. Employees in Iowa must return to work or risk losing their jobs and Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefits (PUC), state officials said at a briefing Thursday.\u00a0 \"We want to remind all individuals that if you are recalled to work, and choose not to return, you may lose eligibility for unemployment benefits. In addition to losing your job,\" said Beth Townsend, director of Iowa Workforce Development. Iowans will still qualify for benefits if a person is diagnosed with the virus, is taking care of a family member with the virus, or lack necessary childcare, Townsend said.\u00a0\u00a0 Employers \"are trying to do whatever they can to be accommodating\" to employees who might have vulnerable family members in their households, Gov. Kim Reynolds said.\u00a0 Since April 4, more than $327 million in PUC payments has been distributed to Iowans, Townsend said.\u00a0 Reynolds lifted limits on nonessential surgeries, farmers' markets and other nonessential business this week in a \"phased\" approach. ##Reopening## The USNS Comfort, a hospital ship brought to the New York City harbor to assist with the coronavirus pandemic, has departed. \"We are not done and we will continue to be here,\" Air Force General Terrence J. O\u2019Shaughnessy, commander, U.S. Northern Command, said this morning before the ship left. O\u2019Shaughnessy thanked the sailors on the ship saying in part, \"they had to adapt to the Covid-19 situation,\" in New York.  At one point during the Comfort\u2019s month-long stay in the city, 75% of the patients on the floating hospital had Covid-19, O\u2019Shaughnessy said.\u00a0 \u201cEven as the Comfort sails away representing the encouragement that the situation has changed, but we are not done and we will continue to be here, we will be here in New York City as long as New York City needs us,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy said.  At least 682 U.S. military doctors and nurses are working across hospitals in the city, the general said. He added this is because the hospitals have the capacity, but not the personnel. The general also recalled one night where a local hospital had oxygen issues and several patients had to be brought to the Comfort for help. The ship has now departed New York City and is on its way to its home base in Norfolk, VA ##Northeast## Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has issued an Executive Order that will place the state under a lower, \u201cmoderate risk\u201d protocol beginning on midnight tomorrow, according to a statement on the governor\u2019s website. The lower risk category allows restaurants and bars to open for dine-in services, but with \u201cstrict requirements,\u201d a Utah Department of Health document said. The requirements include limiting tables to groups of 10, enforcing social distancing and face coverings for staff, the document said. ##West## ##Reopening## Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Thursday morning that there have been 19 new coronavirus deaths in the District \u2013 the largest one-day increase in Washington.\u00a0This brings the total deaths in the District to 224. In the past, the number of daily deaths have been 15 or fewer. Bowser noted\u00a080% of DC deaths have been African-American residents. There were 217 new positive Covid-19 cases in Washington, DC, bringing the total to 4,323. District officials continue to talk with the White House task force to ensure they know how much testing supplies they'll need to combat Covid-19 in the coming months. Bowser reaffirmed that the DC economy will not reopen until the District meets the White House's requirement of 14 days of sustained decreases in cases. Hospitalization rates have been flat for about 15 days in a row, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said during a news conference.\u00a0 As of yesterday, 3,856 patients were hospitalized in Massachusetts with Covid-19, he said. Massachusetts had the largest single-day increase of Covid-19-related deaths yesterday. At least 252 people died, Baker said. ##Northeast## \u00a0 Emily Gurley, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health at the Bloomberg School, said contact tracers need to be properly trained for the system to work.\u00a0 \u201cThese calls can be complicated; and it\u2019s important to make sure that folks have the tools and the training that they need to be able to handle them well,\u201d Gurley said today. Basic introduction training for becoming a contact tracer takes four to five hours, Gurley said. \u201cThat prepares you for more specialized training at the local jurisdiction level, and that can take up to a day or two, because a lot of it is on the job training and intense supervision,\" she added. Gurley, who is leading the program to build an online curriculum and training for the state of New York, said contact tracing is being done every day \u201cto protect the public from people who could be infectious.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThere are many ways that technology can support this public health function and contact tracers,\u201d Gurley said.\u00a0\u201cIt can help them be faster, it can help them organize data, it can help cases in contacts respond in a quick way about their signs and symptoms.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Gurley warned technology should never be used in place of a public health worker saying, \u201cit never takes the place of that personal interaction that will have to happen if this is going to be effective.\u201d Iowa is preparing to ease restrictions in areas with little or no \"virus activity,\" Gov. Kim Reynolds said at a news briefing today.  There were 14 new Covid-19-related deaths Thursday \u2014 the largest one-day jump in the state. \"Covid-19 isn't going anywhere, anytime soon. The virus will continue to be in our communities and unfortunately, people will still get sick until a vaccine is available,\" Reynolds said.  \"Keeping businesses closed for weeks or months longer won't change that fact and it simply is not sustainable. It's not sustainable for Iowans their livelihoods, or our economy,\" Reynolds added.\u00a0 Reynolds lifted limits on nonessential surgeries, farmers' markets and other nonessential business this week in a \"phased\" approach. According to Reynolds, 89% of the state's 7,145 cases are from 22 counties. Restrictions will remain in place in those counties, she said. ##Reopening## The New York State Department of Health is investigating the discovery of dozens of bodies in trucks parked outside a Brooklyn funeral home, Health Commissioner\u00a0Howard\u00a0A.\u00a0Zucker told journalists during Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s news briefing Thursday. He said there hasn't been any formal complaints lodged against that specific funeral home in the past. Some context: On Wednesday, 60 bodies were discovered after someone reported fluids dripping from four trucks parked outside the Andrew Cleckley Funeral Home, a law enforcement official told CNN.  The home was overwhelmed and ran out of room for bodies, which were awaiting cremation, and used the trucks for storage, a second law enforcement source said Wednesday. \u201cOutbreak science\u201d that uses technology better to alert, track and monitor outbreaks can help the US better prepare for future pandemics, said Dylan George, who worked in the Bush and Obama administrations tracking biological threats. He advocated to create a national center for epidemic forecasting and analytics as part of a national strategy to respond to pandemics. \u201cWhen a hurricane is coming\u00a0barreling down on the East\u00a0Coast, we don't scramble to ask\u00a0a handful of random people to\u00a0actually understand what the hurricane is\u00a0doing, figure out how to\u00a0mitigate it and preposition\u00a0materials and personnel across\u00a0the East Coast.\u00a0We have a unified response in\u00a0how to move this forward,\" he said. The same applies for pandemic response, he said. \u201cWe need to figure out a national\u00a0plan and national strategy.\u201d A national center for epidemic forecasting and analytics is going to be really critical, he added. The focus on vaccines may be a good long-term solution but it provides a marginal market in\u00a0public health for private\u00a0sector innovation, he said.\u00a0 \u201cData technologies have\u00a0transformed our society but they\u00a0have not transformed public\u00a0health or health care.\u201d The city of Dallas, Texas will reopen its golf courses and other outdoor facilities tomorrow, May 1st, according to a release from a city spokesperson, Andrea Hawkins. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s \"strategic plan to Open Texas\" includes\u00a0the reopening of golf and outdoor sports, \"provided that the sports do not include contact with other participants, and no more than four participants play the sport at any time,\" Abbott said in a tweet Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Dallas Park and Recreation operates six 18-hole golf courses, five full-service tennis centers\" and a shooting range which are set to reopen with \"strict physical distancing,\" the Dallas release said.\u00a0 Equipment and golf carts will be sanitized between users, the release said. The gun range will open every other shooting range for social distancing, the release said. Dallas parks and trails remain open but amenities like the restrooms, pavilions and water fountains remain closed, the release said.\u00a0 At midnight on Friday, Texas malls, museums, restaurants and movie theaters can open at up to 25% capacity, according to Abbott's executive order. ##Reopening## ##South## The number of people flying into the United States has plummeted to just 2% of last year\u2019s arrivals, according to new US government data.\u00a0\u00a0 Figures from Customs and Border Protection show only 218,347 people have entered the country in April, compared to nearly 10.8 million people in April 2019.\u00a0The figures are through April 28.\u00a0 In March, air arrivals dropped by more than half:\u00a05.4 million compared to 11.4 million in 2019.\u00a0 In February, slightly more people flew into the US in 2020 than in 2019.\u00a0 Airlines have nearly eliminated service between the US and foreign destinations, and are currently flying only about 5% of typical international schedules.\u00a0 The number of people on each international flight has started to tick up in the second half of April, according to the airline industry group Airlines for America, though some of that may be due to airlines condensing nearly-empty international flights.\u00a0The average international flight now carries 28 or 29 passengers, compared to 26 as of last Friday and 24 in the middle of the month.\u00a0 American Airlines CEO Doug Parker, which is part of a major international flight network, said he expects little or no increase in flying as the summer travel season begins.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House\u2019s current plan is to return the week after next to advance another coronavirus relief package. \u201cWe\u2019re not coming back next week. Our plan is to come back the following week,\u201d Pelosi said during her weekly news conference on Thursday.\u00a0 But she also said the House is \u201cat the mercy of the virus\u201d and the schedule will depend on guidance from the Capitol attending physician and the sergeant at arms. In addition to a vote on the next coronavirus relief package, Pelosi said the House will be able to vote on a rules change to allow proxy voting and remote committee work. Pelosi told reporters that Democrats\u2019 main priority is funding for state and local governments.  She said Democrats may propose three separate dedicated funding streams for states, counties, and municipalities in the next coronavirus relief bill, with around $500 billion for states and a \u201csimilar\u201d amount for localities \u2014 potentially adding up to $1 trillion over time. President Trump said on Thursday he's in charge of \"Operation Warp Speed\"\u2014 a recently launched project to accelerate the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine. During an Oval Office meeting with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy opened up to the press, Trump was asked if he was overpromising on a potential vaccine by accelerating its development through the project. \u201cI\u2019m not overpromising. I don\u2019t know who said it but whatever the maximum is, whatever you can humanly do, we\u2019re going to have,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI hope we\u2019re going to have a vaccine, and we\u2019re going to fast-track it like you\u2019ve never seen before, if we come with a vaccine. I think they probably will.\u201d \u00a0Trump was\u00a0also\u00a0asked who is in charge of the operation. \u201cYou know who is in charge of it, honestly?\u00a0I am,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will say, we\u2019re dealing with, as you know, the general and the admiral. They\u2019re very much in charge. But I think probably, more than anything, I\u2019m in charge. And I\u2019m the one that gets blamed. And I get blamed anyways.\u201d CNN previously reported\u00a0that the project has the goal\u00a0of manufacturing hundreds of millions of doses\u00a0that can be made available to Americans by the end of the year. No vaccine has been created yet, though multiple projects are in the works around the world. The effort aims to dramatically cut short the usual development time for a vaccine. It's not clear whether the project could realistically meet that goal. \u00a0 The World Health Organization has reconvened its Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to assess the state of the coronavirus pandemic and review WHO's recommendations on how to respond. On Thursday, the committee met\u00a0via teleconference\u00a0to\u00a0deliberate what views, information and advice will be provided to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday.\u00a0 The last time the committee met was in January when it advised Tedros that the coronavirus outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern and provided temporary recommendations on how WHO and countries can respond. Tedros subsequently declared the public health emergency of international concern, WHO's highest level of alarm for the world.\u00a0 \"At the time, as you may remember, there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China. To be specific, we had 82 cases outside China, and no deaths, when we declared the highest level of international emergency,\" Tedros said during a media briefing in Geneva on Wednesday. \"It\u2019s almost three months since we declared the highest emergency and that\u2019s what was suggested by the Emergency Committee \u2013 to evaluate the evolution of the pandemic, and to advise on updated recommendations,\" Tedros said. \"In the three months since the Emergency Committee last met, WHO has worked day in, day out to sound the alarm, support countries and save lives.\" \u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo outlined a plan to suspend New York City subway service for four hours every night to disinfect the trains. Cuomo said the city's Metropolitan Transportation Authority will stop train service from 1 a.m. until 5 a.m. nightly. \"This is going to be one of the\u00a0most aggressive, creative, challenging undertakings, the\u00a0MTA has done,\" Cuomo said. \"I to 5 are the slow hours,\" Cuomo said, noting that about 10,000 people ride the system during that period of time. He said the city and state will provide alternative travel for essential employees who need to get to and from work during those hours. While this is happening, there will be \"buses, dollar vans\" and, if necessary, \"for-hire vehicles at no cost to the essential worker during those hours.\" The shutdown goes into effect on May 6, the governor said. Watch: ##Northeast## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said contact tracing \u2014 tracking those who came into contact with coronavirus patients \u2014 is key to monitoring and controlling the coronavirus infection rate. But unprecedented widespread tracing throughout the state is a hefty undertaking. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science to do it on an individual basis. The problem is the scale that we have to do this at,\u201d Cuomo said.\u00a0 \u201cIt will require, under any\u00a0estimate, a tracing army to come\u00a0up to scale very, very quickly,\u201d he added. Cuomo said the estimate is that 30 contact tracers are needed for every 100,000 people who are in affected areas, which would be about\u00a06,400 to 70,000 tracers,\u00a0depending on the outcome of projected cases.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s of a scale never been\u00a0done before and, by the way, we\u00a0need it tomorrow,\u201d Cuomo said.\u00a0 Former NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins are working together with the state Department of Health to recruit and train tracers.\u00a0 Watch: ##Northeast## Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the state will use three new smartphone apps to assist with coronavirus contact tracing. The first app will help contact tracers find information and data quickly, he said during a press conference with Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The second app will help the public provide information to the health departments, and the third will allow those in quarantine to access the services they need as well as report symptoms, Bloomberg said. Bloomberg said those hired to do contact tracing will also receive additional training. \"Johns Hopkins has developed a\u00a0training class which can be\u00a0taken remotely.\u00a0It will cover all the basic\u00a0information of epidemics,\u00a0contact tracing and privacy.\u00a0There's also a test at the end\u00a0of the training which you have\u00a0to pass in order to be hired,\" Bloomberg said. Watch: ##Northeast## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that while the death rate is down, the toll is \"still terrible.\" At least 306 people died across New York state yesterday, he said. That's down from the 330 who died on Tuesday and the 335 who died on Monday. \"Number of lives lost, still terrible,\" Cuomo said.\nWatch: ##Northeast## Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett continued to project what his colleagues have referred to as \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d regarding the economy following another release of unprecedented unemployment numbers today, continuing his comparison to the Great Depression. \u201cYou know we\u2019ve been pretty frank with the American people that shutting down of our economy was going to give us a few months of really, really startling data. And we\u2019ve been out in front of the data releases, explaining, you know, exactly why the numbers are as bad as they look, and why you should expect that maybe things could turn around quick,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe fact is that right now we have 30 million people have filed for unemployment insurance. The unemployment rate is probably up around 19%. And those numbers are as startling as anything we\u2019ve seen since the Great Depression.\u201d  Asked by CNN whether it\u2019s realistic, as Jared Kushner said, that the economy could be normal by June and \u201crocking\u201d by July, Hassett said it\u2019s possible and depends on the virus, but he\u2019s planning for every scenario. \u00a0\u201cIf the virus is mostly gone, then everybody will get back to their normal lives and the baseball stadiums will be filled with fans and so on. And if the virus is still lingering or even staying at about the level we see right now, then activity will stay lower. And my instructions, the economic team\u2019s instructions from the President are to have a plan for every eventuality and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.  ##Reopening## Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected calls from some Senate Democrats not to return to session next week while the coronavirus epidemic is still on the rise in Washington and across the country. McConnell said the Senate has essential constitutionally-mandated duties to carry out, including the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees. \u201cI think we can conduct our business safely,\u201d McConnell told Fox News in an interview Thursday.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole lot of other people showing up for work during the pandemic.\u00a0It\ufffd\ufffds time for the Senate to do that as well.\u00a0We have many confirmations, for example.\u00a0The Senate is in the personnel business, the House is not.\u201d The House will not return: House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Tuesday the Capitol attending physician Brian Monahan \"forcefully\" emphasized that the number of novel coronavirus infections in DC is still going up and that some surrounding areas in Maryland are hotspots. \"The House physician's view was that there was a risk to members that was one he would not recommend taking,\" said Hoyer. When McConnell was asked if he had gotten different advice from Monahan, about whether the Senate \u2013 which has only 100 members compared to 435 in the House \u2013 should return to work, McConnell would not directly answer other than to say, \u201cwe can modify our routines in ways that are smart and safe.\u201d New York City this week will begin distributing free face coverings at parks around the city, with a focus on hard-hit communities and high-traffic parks, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday morning. About 100,000 face coverings will be distributed this week, he said. New Yorkers can visit this website for details on where they will be distributed. ##Northeast## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the discovery of 60 bodies stored inside trucks outside a Brooklyn funeral home \"absolutely unacceptable.\" \"Funerals are private organizations, private businesses. They have an obligation to the people they serve to treat them with dignity. I have no idea in the world\u00a0how any funeral home can let this happen,\" de Blasio said today at a press briefing. He continued:  \"I don't understand in this case if the funeral home \u2014 I heard something that a driver didn't show up or something like that \u2014 why on earth did they not either alert the state who regulates them or go to their NYPD precinct and ask for something - do something rather than leave the bodies there. It's unconscionable to me.\" The NYPD said their initial investigation determined there was no criminality. They said the state's Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Health are looking into this matter.  What happened: On Wednesday, the bodies were discovered after someone reported fluids dripping from four trucks parked outside the Andrew Cleckley Funeral Home in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official told CNN.  The home was overwhelmed and ran out of room for bodies, which were awaiting cremation, and used the trucks for storage, a second law enforcement source said Wednesday. ##Northeast## There has been at least 1,042,874\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. At least\u00a061,123\u00a0people have died from the virus so far. On Thursday, Johns Hopkins has reported\u00a02,965\u00a0new cases and\u00a0157\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases. Vice President Pence is scheduled to leave Washington, DC, soon en route Indiana. While there, he\u2019ll tour a GM ventilator facility in Kokomo. Earlier this week, Pence faced widespread criticism for not wearing a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic, which has a policy that everyone must wear masks.  Today, his wife, Karen Pence, claimed he only found out the Mayo Clinic\u2019s policy after leaving \u2013 although it was reported his staff was aware.\u00a0 ##Midwest## The majority of the US population has been under some kind of stay-at-home directive as state leaders work to prevent the spread of coronavirus. But, some states are starting to make moves to reopen their economies. President Trump indicated many states can reopen by tomorrow, May 1, and shared\u00a0federal guidelines\u00a0for restarting the economy with governors. Here are the states whose stay-home orders are expiring today: Florida: Florida will reopen certain businesses throughout much of the state on May 4, except in the counties of Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach, according to Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nIdaho: Gov. Brad Little issued an \"Order to Self-Isolate\" which was amended on April 15 to allow for some businesses and facilities to reopen for curbside pickup, drive-in and drive-thru service. The order will expire today unless extended.\nIowa: Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a State of Public Health Disaster Emergency on March 17 that ordered all nonessential businesses to close until April 30. On Monday, Reynolds announced restaurants, fitness centers, retail stores and enclosed malls can reopen on May 1. Counties where Covid-19 activity is higher will have their closures extended through May 15.\nPennsylvania: Stay-at-home orders across the state will end today and golf courses, marinas, guided fishing trips and privately owned campgrounds could reopen statewide on May 1.\nTexas: As stay-at-home order end today, Gov. Greg Abbott, announced all retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters, malls, museums, and libraries are permitted to reopen on Friday, May 1. These state's stay-at-home orders will end tomorrow, May 1: Indiana: Gov. Eric Holcomb extended the order through May 1 on April 17.\nOhio: Gov. Mike DeWine said the state will start to reopen after the stay-at-home ends on May 1.\nGeorgia: Gov. Brian Kemp is expected to make an announcement today about how restrictions will be relaxed as the state's shelter-in-place order expires May 1. Other states either did not impose a stay-at-home order, or are leaving it in place while opening some parts of their economy on May 1: Arizona: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended the stay-at-home order until May 15. Earlier, he announced that elective surgeries can resume tomorrow.\nOklahoma: Restaurants, dining rooms, movie theaters, sporting venues and gyms will reopen if they maintain \"strict social distancing and sanitation protocols.\"\nOregon: Hospitals, surgical centers, medical offices, and dental offices that meet requirements for Covid-19 safety and preparedness will be able to resume non-urgent procedures on May 1.\nNorth Dakota: Gov. Doug Burgum signed an executive order Wednesday allowing many businesses to open after 8 a.m. on May 1.\nUtah: Gov. Gary Herbert\u00a0extended\u00a0the state's \"Stay Safe, Stay Home\" directive through May 1, although Utah has not issued a stay-at-home mandate. The state will allow restaurants to let customers dine in again \u201cwith extreme precaution\u201d starting tomorrow.  Go here to see where your state stands on reopening. CORRECTION: This post has been updated to reflect that Arizona extended its\u00a0stay-at-home order until May 15. US stocks opened lower on the last trading day of the month. Some more bleak jobs data weighed on market sentiment, as another 3.8 million Americans filed for initial unemployment benefits last week. The total of first-time claims climbed above 30 million over the past six weeks. Meanwhile in Europe, the European Central Bank said it would take no more action on its key policies, although it did inject some more stimulus into the European economy. Here's what happened at the opening: The Dow opened 1.1% or 280 points, lower\nThe S&P 500 kicked off 0.7% lower.\nThe Nasdaq Composite opened down 0.1%. More context: Despite more bleak economic data hinting at the disruption the coronavirus pandemic is causing the economy, it was a historically good month for stocks. The S&P 500 is on track for its best month since October 1974, and the Dow is looking at its best month since January 1987. The Nasdaq is on track for its best monthly performance since June 2000. You can follow live updates on the markets here. \u00a0 Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is poised to make an announcement to ease social distancing restrictions, his spokesperson told CNN this morning.\u00a0 \u201cWe will announce more later today,\u201d Candice Broce said when asked by CNN about a shelter-at-home-order set to expire at midnight. Broce declined to give more details including the time of an official announcement. \u201cNo additional information to announce at this time. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for now,\u201d she said. About Georgia: Last Friday, Kemp allowed for the reopening of hair and nail salons, barber shops, massage businesses and gyms under new safety standards. He allowed restaurants and theaters to reopen with new restrictions Monday. But Georgia is projected to see its number of daily Covid-19 deaths nearly double by early August, according to a model shared by the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0 ##South## ##Reopening## Second lady Karen Pence defended her husband, Vice President Mike Pence, who faced widespread criticism for not wearing a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic earlier this week.\u00a0 She was asked about the visit during an appearance on \"Fox and Friends.\" \u201cThat's a great question, I\u2019m glad that you asked me. First of all, it was a great visit to Mayo. They are doing amazing research with blood from recovered Covid-19 patients, and as\u00a0our medical experts have told us\u00a0wearing a mask prevents you\u00a0from spreading the disease. And\u00a0knowing that he doesn't have\u00a0Covid-19, he didn't wear one,\u201d she said. She claimed that Pence only found out the Mayo Clinic\u2019s policy after leaving \u2013 although it was reported his staff was aware.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was actually after he left\u00a0Mayo Clinic that he found out\u00a0that they had a policy of asking\u00a0everyone to wear a mask.\u00a0So you know, someone has worked on this whole\u00a0task force for over two months is\u00a0not someone who would have done\u00a0anything to offend anyone or hurt anyone or\u00a0scare anyone.\u00a0I'm glad that you gave me the\u00a0opportunity to talk about that,\u201d she said.\u00a0 The Vice President is expected to travel to a GM plant in Kokomo, Indiana, later today. It remains to be seen if he will wear a mask this time \u2013 though his wife\u2019s comments suggest it\u2019s unlikely. ##Midwest## House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted to the latest unemployment numbers, as the total number of first-time claims rose to 30.3 million over the past six weeks, saying that the US economy won\u2019t rebound until there is widespread coronavirus testing.\u00a0 \u201cI myself think the path to our\u00a0re-entering the economy is\u00a0testing, testing, testing.\u00a0It all comes back to science and\u00a0the health and well-being of the\u00a0American people,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou cannot turn\u00a0the economy around without the\u00a0scientific leadership on it,\u201d Pelosi added. She called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s suggestion that states should declare bankruptcy \u201can excuse.\u201d \u201cHe's making it look like there\u2019s some blue state-red state\u00a0thing here \u2026\u00a0It only has to do with the\u00a0coronavirus.\u00a0And the governors are united,\u00a0Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi also said that she wants to get federal stimulus funds to states and also directly to municipalities, and that money will be given for a years-long distribution period.\u00a0 \u201cWe're not going to be able to\u00a0cover all of it.\u00a0But we'll be able to enable them\u00a0to have sustainability,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Watch more: The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been leading federal operations response since mid-March, is working with the Health and Human Services Department to develop transition plans, according to a FEMA spokesperson. \u201cPlanning is underway to sustain Federal COVID-19 response operations in support of states, tribes, and territories. HHS and FEMA staff are closely coordinating to develop transition plans, which will likely involve transitioning certain functions and staff back to HHS,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. Decisions on what adjustments will be made, or when, have not been made yet, the spokesperson added, noting that FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor \u201ccoordinates closely with senior HHS officials daily on operations and will do so on transition plans.\u201d FEMA said it will remain leading the \"operational coordination for the COVID-19 response until directed differently by President Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\" CNN has previously reported\u00a0that FEMA is also looking ahead to natural disasters, like hurricane season, and preparing their response for those events. Bloomberg\u00a0first reported\u00a0FEMA\u2019s transition plans. Thousands of inmates in Ohio prisons have been diagnosed with coronavirus.  As testing in facilities around the state continues, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC) is now reporting\u00a0at least 3,890\u00a0prisoners have tested positive as of April 29.\u00a0At least\u00a05,676\u00a0have been tested total. The total inmate population as of Tuesday was 47,820, the ODRC spokeswoman tells CNN.\u00a0 \u201cThe reason that you are seeing numbers out of our prisons, that are much, much higher than other places is because we made a decision to go test everybody.\u00a0And when we've got a hotspot we move in and we\u2019ve surged testing in,\u201d Gov. Mike DeWine said during a press briefing yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0 There have been\u00a027\u00a0confirmed Covid-19 related inmate deaths.\u00a0 \"Because we are testing everyone \u2013 including those who are not showing symptoms \u2013 we are getting positive test results on individuals who otherwise would have never been tested because they were asymptomatic,\" JoEllen Smith, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, said. \"Approximately 95% of the positive cases are asymptomatic,\u201d Smith added. According to the data,\u00a0419 prison employees\u00a0also have tested positive and two died due to the virus. ##Midwest## It's Thursday morning in the US. Here's what you need to know to start your day: States are starting to reopen: More than half of US states will begin reopening by the end of the week.\u00a0Most counties in Florida will be allowed to reopen certain businesses on Monday. Gov. Ron DeSantis said restaurants and retail spaces could let customers inside, but only at 25% capacity.\nCalifornia tightens restrictions: California Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to announce that all beaches and parks will be closed starting tomorrow.\nSports won't be back anytime soon: Dr. Anthony Fauci says it\u00a0may be a year before sports return to normal\u00a0in the US.\nFederal social distancing guidelines will be faded out: The guidelines, which are set to expire at the end of the month, won't be extended. Trump said the guidelines would fade out when states start to reopen. \"I am very much in favor of what they're doing,\" Trump said of governors who are opening businesses.\nPossible Covid-19 treatment: Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci said he expects the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency-use authorization for remdesivir \"really quickly\" to treat coronavirus. ##Reopening## ##South## ##West## ##Remdesivir## Another 3.8 million Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits in the week ended April 25. In total, more than 30 million people have filed first-time claims since mid-March as the coronavirus pandemic is forcing businesses to close and lay off workers. The Trump administration's program to accelerate the development of a potential coronavirus\u00a0vaccine, called \"Operation Warp Speed,\" has the goal to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses by January \u2014 which is in the realm of possibility, according to the nation's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci said that he is part of the team involved in that project.\u00a0 \"We're in the early phases of a trial \u2014 Phase 1.\u00a0When you go into the next phase, we\u2019re going to safely and carefully, but as quickly as we possibly can, try and get an answer as to whether it works and is safe. And if so, we\u2019re going to start ramping up production with the companies involved,\" Fauci said this morning during and appearance on the \"Today\" show.\u00a0 \"You don\u2019t wait until you get an answer before you start manufacturing -- you at risk proactively start making it, assuming it\u2019s going to work, and if it does, then you can scale up and hopefully get to that timeline,\" Fauci added. \"So we want to go quickly, but we want to make sure it\u2019s safe and it\u2019s effective. I think that is doable.\" Some background: Fauci previously has said that a coronavirus\u00a0vaccine\u00a0could take 12 to 18 months to develop. The United States currently has the timeline of developing its\u00a0vaccine\u00a0by the end of the year. \"Remember go back in time, I was saying in January and February that it would be a year to 18 months,\" Fauci said. \"January is a year \u2014 so it isn't that much from what I had originally said.\"\u00a0 Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he expects the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency-use authorization for remdesivir soon to treat Covid-19.\u00a0 Fauci\u00a0said that while the FDA has not made a final decision yet, he projects \"it\u2019s going to be really quickly. Speaking during an appearance on the Today show,\u00a0Fauci\u00a0said he believes Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, is committed to make the treatment available \"as much as they can, as quickly as they can.\" \"I'm pretty confident that that will be the case because I believe they're committed to trying to get this out as quickly as possible,\"\u00a0Fauci\u00a0told NBC's Savannah Guthrie. What this is about: A trial of the experimental drug remdesivir showed it\u00a0might help patients recover more quickly\u00a0from the infection.\u00a0 Yesterday, Fauci was optimistic about the results, saying \"The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.\" However the World Health Organization said it's too early to comment on the remdesivir trial results released Wednesday. ##Remdesivir## A second round of the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0is \"inevitable,\" the nation's top infectious disease doctor says, but just how bad it is will depend on the progress the US makes in the coming months. \"If by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures that you need to address this, we should do reasonably well,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"If we don't do that successfully, we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter.\" If states begin lifting restrictions too early,\u00a0Fauci says he predicts the country could see a rebound of\u00a0the virus\u00a0that would \"get us right back in the same boat that we were a few weeks ago,\" adding that the country could see\u00a0many more deaths than are currently predicted. So far, more than 1 million Americans have been infected and at least 58,965 have died. A\u00a0leading model predicts\u00a0more than 72,000 people will die in the US by early August. The Florida Department of Health has responded to scrutiny regarding the state\u2019s Covid-19 death count, which was reported by the Tampa Bay Times and said the state is following CDC guidelines.\u00a0 The Times article claimed that Florida\u2019s Medical Examiner Commission reported a Covid-19 death tally that was 10% higher than the one made publicly available by the Florida Department of Health (FLDOH.) The newspaper further reported that the commission has not released a tally in nine days after state health department officials \u201cintervened.\u201d According to the FLDOH, Covid-19 deaths currently reported to the public include Florida residents only.\u00a0Currently, the state is reporting more than 1,200 deaths. \u201cPer CDC, people are listed according to their place of residence. This ensures cases are not inadvertently listed twice,\u201d the FLDOH said in a statement. For example, if a New York resident dies from Covid-19 in Florida, New York reports the death and Florida does not. While Florida is not reporting the number of out-of-state Covid-19 deaths publicly, CNN asked the FLDOH for the number\u00a0Wednesday and obtained the list via email, which includes 43 deaths from other states and other countries. \u201cReporting deaths by residency is the appropriate method utilized to calculate disease rates, which allow for a more accurate analysis of disease impacts on populations through the incorporation of demographic data - a critical aspect of public health planning. Population size is determined using census data, which is based on residency,\u201d\u00a0the FLDOH wrote in a statement to CNN. CNN corresponded with two medical examiner offices in Florida who confirmed that medical examiners report deaths within their geographic jurisdiction and not by place of residence. Therefore, the state\u2019s county-by-county Covid-19 death toll and the county-by-county death toll reported by medical examiners will not match. For example, if residents of New York, New Jersey and Miami-Dade county die in Broward County from Covid-19, the Broward County medical examiner\u2019s office would report a death toll of\u00a0three.\u00a0In that example, the Florida Department of Health, which says it is following CDC guidelines, would record a Covid-19 death toll for Broward County of\u00a0zero. When asked about the newspaper\u2019s allegation that Florida\u2019s Department of Health intervened with the disclosures of Covid-19 deaths by medical examiners, the FLDOH said the department had concerns about personal information being shared. \u201cThe Florida Department of Health has spoken with counsel for Medical Examiners to explain concerns on disclosing personal identifiable information,\u201d the FLDOH said in a statement. CNN reached out to the Florida Medical Examiner's Commission and the governor's office and did not hear back.\u00a0 ##South## The Trump administration\u00a0is launching a project\u00a0to accelerate\u00a0the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine, a senior administration official said Wednesday. The project, called \"Operation Warp Speed,\" has the goal\u00a0of manufacturing hundreds of millions of doses\u00a0that can be made available to Americans by the end of the year, the official said. No vaccine has been created yet, though multiple projects are in the works around the world. The effort aims to dramatically cut short the usual development time for a vaccine. It's not clear whether the project could realistically meet that goal. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has repeatedly cautioned that a vaccine for the virus would take between\u00a0a year and 18 months. The official said pharmaceutical companies and government researchers would work together to beat that timeline, in what's described as a Manhattan Project-like effort. The effort, which was first reported by\u00a0Bloomberg News, comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US surges\u00a0past 1 million, with researchers saying the number of deaths\u00a0could rise in coming weeks. Florida will reopen certain businesses throughout much of the state on Monday, Gov. Ron DeSantis said. \"We will get Florida back on its feet by using an approach that is safe, smart, and step by step,\" DeSantis said on Wednesday. DeSantis said restaurants and retail spaces could let customers inside, but only at 25% capacity, and people must adhere to social distancing guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Restaurants can offer outdoor seating if tables are 6 feet apart. \"Outdoor transmission, as far as we've seen, has been more difficult than the indoor climate controlled transition,\" the governor said, adding that medical officials recommended the outdoor seating change. Movie theaters can't reopen yet. The governor said it wouldn't be prudent, and it would be difficult to maintain social distancing. Bars, fitness centers and places that offer personal services, likes hair styling, also will open later. People can schedule non-urgent surgeries again, he said, though it depends on a hospital's ability to handle surges in cases and availability of protective equipment. DeSantis said the new measures he announced would not include three of the counties hit hardest by coronavirus. They are Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, which account for about 6.2 million of Florida's residents, according to\u00a0US Census data. ##South##"], "Language": false}
