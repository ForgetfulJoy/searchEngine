I don\u2019t think you can, you should disrupt everybody else\u2019s rights. But in all fairness, they stood up had their backs to me, it\u2019s not the first time in my life I\u2019ve been protested, ain\u2019t going to be the last.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cThey have a right to say what they want to say,\u201d Bloomberg said.\u00a0 Michael Bloomberg said he called Pete Buttigieg on Sunday and talked to him after the former South Bend mayor dropped out of the president race.\u00a0 \u201cI just said -- it took two minutes -- I just said, look, I\u2019m sorry it ended that way for you, and you\u2019re a gentleman and I listened when you were, to your speeches, and I thought a lot of what you said made sense and I tell you you have a big career going forward,\" Bloomberg told CNN's Don Lemon.  \"He went through the Bloomberg Foundation training program for mayors, he was in the first class, so I have to say nice things about him,\" Bloomberg said.  Michael Bloomberg suggested Joe Biden was not ready to be President of the United States, and that the job requires a \u201cmanager and executive.\u201d \"(Biden) is a legislator, and the job (of being president) requires a manager and executive, and I feel very strongly about that,\" Bloomberg told CNN's Don Lemon.  Lemon responded, \"He was the Vice President. (Former President Barack) Obama thought he was ready. You don't think he's ready?\" \"Obama thought he was ready for what?\" Bloomberg said. \"He was his Vice President, he was ready to be president. That's the next job,\" Lemon said. \"I don't know, you'd have to talk to President Obama about that,\" Bloomberg said. \"All I know is we keep putting legislators in the job that requires a manager.\" Earlier in the interview, Bloomberg told Lemon that he was the candidate who could beat President Donald Trump, and that he was \"ready for the job, and I don't think any of the others are.\" Michael Bloomberg said Vice President Mike Pence does not have the credentials to be in charge of the US government\u2019s\u00a0response\u00a0to the coronavirus.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Don Lemon said, \u201cI want to talk about the coronavirus. Cases are on the rise in the United States right now. If you were in the White House right now, what exactly would you do to stop its spread?\u201d \u201cYou first have to have somebody in charge that is a doctor or scientist with a reputation for dealing with pandemics worldwide. It is not Michael Pence, who I think he said something about there\u2019s no connection between smoking and cancer. That is not the kind of person you have,\u201d Bloomberg said.\u00a0 Bloomberg said Pence \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the credentials to do this, and so people worry about it.\u201d See Bloomberg's answer: Michael Bloomberg said he is the candidate who can beat President Donald Trump, and that he is the only candidate who is ready for the job.\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Don Lemon asked Bloomberg, \u201cWe\u2019re on the eve of Super Tuesday. The stakes are high for you. Tomorrow night you\u2019re going to have to convince voters that you\u2019re the guy. So how do you convince them that you are the one? What do you say to them? \u201cTwo things,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI can beat Donald Trump, and I don\u2019t know that any of the other Democratic candidates can, and two, that I am ready for the job and I don\u2019t think any of the others are.\u201d When it comes to paying for her health care plan, Elizabeth Warren used her appearance on CNN tonight to share her ideas and how they compare to Bernie Sanders'. The question from CNN's Don Lemon specifically asked about Sanders' proposals on healthcare, free\u00a0college and more and how the Vermont senator plans to pay for them compares to Warren's. \"I don't see it the same way.\u00a0Bernie thinks we should raise taxes\u00a0on middle class families to pay\u00a0for healthcare.\u00a0And I've shown we don't have to do that.\u00a0A much better way to do it raise\u00a0taxes on the top 1%.\u00a0To make giant corporations like\u00a0Amazon and Eli Lilly that report billions\u00a0of dollars in profit and pay\u00a0nothing in taxes, I think\u00a0cracking down harder on them\u00a0makes sense.\u00a0And my personal favorite, hiring\u00a0more IRS agents to go after the\u00a0richest tax cheats.\u00a0Turns out we can generate a lot\u00a0of money from that,\" Warren said. More on Sanders' healthcare plan: Sanders\u00a0has been pushing a single-payer health care system for decades. It\u2019s the centerpiece of his vision for a more democratic socialist America. There are several such proposals for a single-payer system, including a\u00a0100-page\u00a0draft bill\u00a0most recently introduced, with tweaks, by Sanders in 2019. The Medicare for All plan would leave intact the current infrastructure of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, but nationalize the health insurance industry. Nearly all the money individuals and employers currently pay into the system as well as much of the money states pay would, under Sanders\u2019 plan, instead go through the federal government. Elizabeth Warren touted her work taking on Wall Street and said it takes hard work to get a progressive agenda passed when asked about recent contrasts the senator has drawn between herself and Bernie Sanders.  CNN\u2019s Don Lemon said, \u201cYou have said you and Sen.\u00a0Sanders are friends.\u00a0You are now drawing sharp\u00a0contrasts between you and Sen\u00a0Sanders. You\u2019re saying, \u2018I get real stuff\u00a0done.\u00a0I don't want to be president just to\u00a0yell at people.\u2019\u00a0Are you suggesting that Sen.\u00a0Sanders wouldn't be an effective\u00a0president?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cLook, I\u2019m here to make the case for why I think I would be the best\u00a0president for our country,\u201d Warren responded.\u00a0 \u201cI had warned and warned and warned about\u00a0the financial crash, and there were a lot of progressives\u00a0who really wanted to reign in Wall\u00a0Street, but I was the one who got in there,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI did the hard work, I dug in, I took on Wall Street, I took on the big banks.\u201d \u201cWe can make government work for the people,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut it takes a lot of hard work to\u00a0get this kind of progressive\u00a0agenda passed.\u00a0And I\u2019ve got a track record for\u00a0that.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren spoke about the new endorsements for Joe Biden from Beto O'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg as an example of how \"they see the\u00a0world in many ways the same\" as the former vice president. \"I think they see the\u00a0world in many ways the same way\u00a0that the vice president does.\u00a0So I understand that.\u00a0It makes some sense.\u00a0But what really has changed is\u00a0the field has narrowed sharply.\u00a0And this is going to be a race\u00a0that really puts it to people\u00a0about what kind of leader we\u00a0want for the Democratic party.\u00a0But also what kind of leader we want\u00a0for our country,\" Warren said. Watch Warren here: Beto O\u2019Rourke endorsed Joe Biden at a campaign event in Dallas, Texas on Monday night.\u00a0 \u201cLadies and gentlemen, tomorrow,\u00a0March 3, 2020, I will be casting\u00a0my ballot for Joe Biden,\u201d the former Texas congressman and presidential contender said.  \u201cAnd let me tell you why,\" O'Rourke continued. \"We need somebody who can beat\u00a0Donald Trump.\u00a0The man in the White House today\u00a0poses an existential threat to\u00a0this country, to our democracy, to free and fair elections.\u00a0And we need somebody who can\u00a0beat him.\"\u00a0 Watch moment here: Joe Biden share his appreciation for Sen. Amy Klobuchar tonight during a rally in Dallas, characterizing her presidential campaign as one that was \"all about what\u00a0we can get done.\" \"She knows how to get things\u00a0done.\u00a0She really does.\u00a0That's why Amy has never lost.\u00a0And she's not losing now,\" Biden said following Klobuchar's speech where she endorsed the former vice president. \"You'll hear a lot from Amy\u00a0Klobuchar.\u00a0For a long time.\u00a0That's why she's one of the most\u00a0effective senators in the United\u00a0States Senate.\u00a0Her campaign was all about what\u00a0we can get done. How to make America better every\u00a0day in simple straightforward\u00a0ways.\" Biden also used the opportunity to criticize President Trump. \"Amy spoke of something I have\u00a0made central in my campaign for\u00a0president as well.\u00a0To compete and complete the\u00a0total lack of empathy and\u00a0decency in this current\u00a0president.\u00a0He cannot stay there.\u00a0He cannot stay.\u00a0We all know it. There is no sense of decency and\u00a0honor.\u00a0The way he ridicules people and\u00a0demeans people.\u00a0Talks about and demonizes people who\u00a0are different,\" Biden said. Amy Klobuchar ended her presidential campaign on Monday night and endorsed Joe Biden at a Biden campaign event in Dallas, Texas.\u00a0 \u201cIt is up to us, all of us, to put\u00a0our country back together, to\u00a0heal this country and then to\u00a0build something even greater.\u00a0I believe we can do this\u00a0together, and that is why today\u00a0I am ending my campaign and\u00a0endorsing Joe Biden for\u00a0president,\u201d Klobuchar said.\u00a0 \u201c(Biden) can bring our country\u00a0together and build that\u00a0coalition of our fired-up\u00a0Democratic base, and it is fired\u00a0up, as well as Independents and\u00a0moderate Republicans, because we\u00a0do not in our party want to just\u00a0eek by a victory. We want to win big.\u00a0And Joe Biden can do that,\u201d Klobuchar said.\u00a0 Hear from Sen. Klobuchar: Bernie Sanders said he wanted to open the door to supporters of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who are both expected to endorse Joe Biden for President on Monday night.  \u201cBefore I begin, I want to\u00a0mention to you what I think all\u00a0of you know, and they know\u00a0that, you know that your\u00a0Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped\u00a0out of the presidential race today,\u201d Sanders said at a rally in Minnesota, Klobuchar\u2019s home state.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve known Amy\u00a0for a very long time,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cWe came into the Senate together\u00a0in 2006, and she is one of the\u00a0hardest workers that I know.\u00a0I like Amy.\u201d \u201cAnd yesterday, Pete Buttigieg\u00a0dropped out of the race as well,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd as you all know, Pete's\u00a0campaign was a historic\u00a0campaign and a brave campaign.\u00a0He is the first openly gay\u00a0candidate for President of the\u00a0United States.\" \u201cAnd tonight, I want to open the\u00a0door to Amy's supporters, to\u00a0Pete's supporters.\u00a0I know that there are political\u00a0differences, but I also know\u00a0that virtually all of Amy's\u00a0support and Pete's support\u00a0understand that we have got to\u00a0move toward a government which\u00a0believes in justice, not greed,\u201d Sanders said.\u00a0 Former Vice President Joe Biden took shots at President Trump and his handling of the coronavirus outbreak and how the the President has made it \"always about him.\" \"I would take steps we took\u00a0when we dealt with ebola.\u00a0I would not have disbanded the\u00a0office within the White House\u00a0that Trump eliminated.\u00a0I would not be in a position\u00a0where I would have waited until\u00a0now to try to figure how you get testing kits put in\u00a0place.\u00a0We knew back in January.\u00a0I would have been in a\u00a0position where I would not have\u00a0eviscerated the budget of the\u00a0CDC.\u00a0I'd let the scientists make the\u00a0decisions,\" Biden said. Biden wanted to make sure Trump understands that the outbreak is \"about the American people.\" \"It's about what's happening in\u00a0the world and he hasn't listened\u00a0to any of the experts that have spoken, as best as I can tell.\u00a0Because all that he's done hasn't been\u00a0very helpful,\" Biden said. Trump and the coronavirus: Trump and other White House officials are on the attack against the coronavirus, but also against the President\u2019s critics, who say his administration was\u00a0slow to respond\u00a0to the burgeoning pandemic and aren\u2019t doing enough to protect Americans. At a February 27\u00a0press conference\u00a0meant to reassure the public, Trump seemed to spend more time defending his own actions than explaining what was being done to combat the coronavirus. \u201cI took a lot of heat,\u201d Trump said about the travel ban he imposed in January, which blocked people who were in China from entering the United States. \u201cSome people called me racist because I made a decision so early\u2026 It was a bold decision, and it turned out to be a good decision.\u201d Watch: Joe Biden fired back against comments made by Michael Bloomberg claiming the former vice president is a legislator and \"not a manager.\" \"It requires somebody who has\u00a0gotten things done.\u00a0Requires someone who understands\u00a0how to bring people together.\u00a0Requires a Democrat by the way\u00a0to be a democratic president.\u00a0And it requires someone who has\u00a0a track record and the President\u00a0handed me significant\u00a0responsibility and presidential\u00a0authority when I was the vice\u00a0president.\u00a0I'm the guy that managed the\u00a0$900 billion recovery act. I got the votes for it and I got\u00a0it passed, and then managed it\u00a0day-to-day.\u00a0I did the same thing in a number\u00a0of foreign policy issues,\" Biden told CNN's Anderson Cooper tonight. Biden added: \"The next president on day one has\u00a0to be ready to stand up and\u00a0command the world stage and\u00a0unite this country.\" Hear from Former VP Biden: Bernie Sanders was critical of President Trump and how he has handled the coronavirus outbreak that has spanned the globe. \"Well, look.\u00a0That Trump would appoint Mike\u00a0Pence as the head of the task\u00a0force on the coronavirus just\u00a0speaks to how far out of touch\u00a0Trump is with reality or his disrespect for science.\u00a0We need scientists running our\u00a0response to the coronavirus, not a\u00a0politician like Pence who barely\u00a0believes in science at all.\u00a0So I would hope very much that\u00a0Trump understands that the\u00a0coronavirus is a major, major\u00a0threat not only to our country,\u00a0but to the entire world,\" Sanders told CNN's Anderson Cooper tonight. Sanders said he hopes that Trump and his administration will continue to work and utilize the expertise of organizations like the National Institute of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"We've got to work with the\u00a0international community.\u00a0We've got to work with the World\u00a0Health Organization.\u00a0We have to adequately fund our\u00a0hospitals, our doctors, the NIH, the\u00a0CDC.\u00a0This is, despite what Trump may think.\u00a0... Trump is also the genius that\u00a0told us that climate change is\u00a0also a hoax.\u00a0So what we need to do is have\u00a0Congress demand that we\u00a0adequately fund our response\u00a0that we work with the global\u00a0community and that we have\u00a0scientists running the program,\u00a0not politicians who don't\u00a0believe in science,\" Sanders added. More on the coronavirus: The\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0has\u00a0killed more than 3,000\u00a0people, the vast majority in mainland China. There are now\u00a0more than 88,000\u00a0global cases, with infections on every continent except Antarctica. Watch: Of all the things people call Sen. Bernie Sanders, one that he agrees with wholeheartedly is being labelled a democratic socialist.  When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper tonight whether he regretted being labelled as such, the Vermont senator said, \"I am what I am.\" \"I am what I am and what\u00a0democratic socialism is about to\u00a0me is understanding that we have\u00a0in many ways, a socialist\u00a0society today.\u00a0But it is not Dr. Martin Luther\u00a0king Jr. reminded us, we have\u00a0socialism for the rich and\u00a0rugged individualism and for the\u00a0poor and other people,\" Sanders said.  Sanders then set his sights on Trump, who he claims has abused a system of \"socialism for the rich.\" \"When Donald Trump was a private\u00a0businessman, he received $800\u00a0million in breaks and subsidies.\u00a0That's called socialism for the rich.\u00a0When Amazon doesn't pay a nickel\u00a0in income tax last year, that's called\u00a0socialism for the rich.\u00a0When we give billions of tax\u00a0breaks to the fossil fuel\u00a0industry who's destroying our\u00a0planet, that's called socialism for\u00a0the rich.\u00a0What I want to do is bring\u00a0government programs to help\u00a0working families,\" Sanders said. Hear from Sen. Sanders: Bernie Sanders in an interview with CNN said President Donald Trump should stay out of the Democratic race for president. \"President Trump -- stay out of the Democratic primary,\" Sanders said.  Earlier on Monday, Trump tweeted that \"they\" were \"staging a coup against Bernie,\" seemingly in reference Democrats rallying around Joe Biden after his victory in South Carolina and ahead of Super Tuesday.  See the moment: Bernie Sanders spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper tonight about his presidential campaign and the consolidation of the moderate vote following Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropping out of the race for the White House. \"From day one, we have been taking on the establishment. Whether it's the corporate\u00a0establishment on Wall Street,\u00a0the drug company, the insurance\u00a0companies, the fossil fuel\u00a0industry or the political\u00a0establishment.\u00a0Let me be very clear, it is no\u00a0surprise they do not want me to\u00a0become president because our\u00a0administration will transform\u00a0this country to create an\u00a0economy and a government that\u00a0works for all of the people not\u00a0just the 1%,\" Sanders said. One of the key reasons why the Vermont senator is running is to defeat President Trump, he said. \"It will not be the same old same\u00a0old.\u00a0But the other reason I am running is to defeat Donald\u00a0Trump.\u00a0And the fact of the matter is if\u00a0we want to defeat Donald Trump,\u00a0we're going to need a campaign\u00a0that has energy and excitement\u00a0that can speak to working\u00a0people, young people, people who\u00a0have given up on the political\u00a0establishment,\" Sanders said. Watch: Joe Biden said Pete Buttigieg reminds him of his son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.\u00a0 \u201cI don't think I've ever done\u00a0this before, but (Buttigieg) reminds me\u00a0of my son, Beau.\u00a0I know that may not mean much to\u00a0most people, but to me it's the\u00a0highest compliment I can give\u00a0any man or woman,\u201d Biden said.  \u201cLike Beau, he has a backbone like a ramrod. I really mean this. I think about it,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0 Biden\u2019s comments came right after Buttigieg endorsed Biden for President. Buttigieg dropped out of the presidential race on Sunday.\u00a0 Hear his comments: Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke plans to endorse Joe Biden tonight, a Biden aide confirmed.\u00a0 The news was first reported by The New York Times.\u00a0 O\u2019Rourke, a former 2020 presidential contender, is a major pick-up for Biden on the eve of the Texas primary. He still carries major political weight in the state, which is a battleground on Super Tuesday, when 14 states and American Samoa will vote. Some context: The expected endorsement comes after former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg endorsed Biden at a campaign stop Monday night in Dallas.  Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is expected to announce she is ending her campaign and endorsing Biden at a rally in Dallas today.  Pete Buttigieg endorsed Joe Biden on Monday at an event in Dallas, Texas, after dropping out of the race on Sunday.\u00a0 \u201cIt is an honor to be here with Vice President Biden. You know, when I ran for President, we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for the values that we share,\u201d Buttigieg said.\u00a0 \u201cThat was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president. And it is in the name of that very same goal that I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president of the United States,\u201d Buttigieg said.\u00a0 Watch: Pete Buttigieg was on track to have his biggest fundraising quarter of his campaign before deciding to end his presidential campaign, a campaign aide told CNN.  The campaign had raised\u00a0$24.5 million so far this quarter when Buttigieg decided to exit the race, nearly eclipsing his biggest haul in the 2nd quarter of last year when he raised $24.8 million.\u00a0 The campaign raised $18.4 million in February and was on track to meet its fundraising goal of $13 million between Nevada and Super Tuesday, said the aide.\u00a0 Still, the campaign's federal election reports have shown Buttigieg's operation was quickly spending whatever money it brought in -- and then some. According to his financial filing for January, the former mayor entered February with $6.6 million in the bank and spent 227% more than they raised the first month of 2020. CORRECTION: This post has been updated to reflect the amount the campaign raised in February. As President Donald Trump was departing for a Monday night rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, he told reporters assembled on the South Lawn his feelings on the Democratic primary. \u201cI think it\u2019s rigged against Bernie, but maybe he\u2019ll pull it through,\" he said. \"It was rigged against me four years ago, but I pulled it through. ... it's rigged against Bernie. No doubt about it.\" Trump went on to use a phrase used many times during the recent impeachment drama when asked about the endorsements of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar of rival Joe Biden. \"Probably they say, 'Hey look, if I win I\u2019ll put you in the administration.\u2019 That\u2019s called quid pro quo, right? Quid pro quo. And they probably said, \u2018Hey listen, if I win, I\u2019ll give you an endorsement, but will you take me in the administration.\u2019 I\u2019m sure nothing like that has ever happened right, but that\u2019s the way it seems to go.\" EMILY's List, the powerful Democratic organization that helps elect women candidates who support abortion rights, endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president Monday.\u00a0 \u201cElizabeth Warren is clearly the best candidate to unify the Democratic party after a long primary, generate excitement across the country, and take on Donald Trump,\u201d EMILY's List president Stephanie Schriock said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cShe is also a candidate not just ready to be president, but with the plans and vision to build an administration that looks out for all Americans.\u00a0We are proud to announce our support for her and will be working hard to help her win in the primary and in November.\u201d The endorsement marks only the third time the group has backed a candidate in a presidential primary, following endorsements of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 and 2016 primaries. A public dispute last weekend over the Bernie Sanders campaign's use of the name and iconography of the historic rap group Public Enemy ended with the firing of one of the group's core members. CNN's Amir Vera and Lisa Respers France reported Monday that Flavor Flav, an original member of PE and quite possibly the most well-known hype man in hip hop, was fired by group leader Chuck D after Flav's complaints about Democratic front-runner Bernie Sanders' use of Public Enemy's name, biggest hit and iconography to promote a rally. Chuck D said he approved of the use of Public Enemy's branding since he owned it.  Read more from Vera and France about the dispute. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and former national security adviser Susan Rice both endorsed Joe Biden for President Monday.\u00a0 Reid said in a statement that Biden\u2019s \u201cstrength of character and deep experience stand in the starkest contrast to Trump\u2019s amorality, corruption and utter incompetence.\u201d Emphasizing electability, Reid asserted \u201cDemocrats need a candidate who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201d \u201cThat candidate is Joe Biden,\u201d he continued.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBiden will be a much-needed stabilizing force following Trump\u2019s disastrous term, offering a positive and progressive alternative to Trump\u2019s dark vision of racism, xenophobia and policies built on cruelty and exclusion,\u201d Reid said. The comments were echoed by Rice who called Biden \u201cthe best chance to expand the Democrats' majority in the House and take back the Senate\u201d in a string of tweets. Every day, he will put the national interest above his personal interest,\u201d she said, adding \u201cAbove all, @JoeBiden is a Democrat and the strongest candidate to take on and defeat Trump. That's why Trump is so scared of Biden.\u201d Learn more: Michael Bloomberg received the endorsement of Samoan Chief Fa\u2019alagiga Nina Tua\u2019au-Glaude ahead of Super Tuesday, when voters in 14 states as well as American Samoa will take to the polls. \"I believe in Mike's message of change for the people of American Samoa -- he has the experience and the vision to bring about the change we need - including staving off climate change, which will be devastating to our home. He has my family's vote, and my village,\u201d Tua'au-Glaude, a former delegate for President Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and a former employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said about Bloomberg. Bloomberg has invested heavily in the American territory, which is located in the South Pacific. The campaign said it has seven full-time staff located in American Samoa. They are also running television ads, targeted radio ads and targeted digital and print ads across the islands, according to the campaign. The campaign has also organized an extensive voter registration drive ahead of the territory\u2019s caucus on Tuesday, which will allocate six pledged delegates.\u00a0 Despite a poor showing in all previous Democratic presidential contests, Tulsi Gabbard is sticking to her campaign travel schedule for now. She told CNN on Monday that her campaign would continue with events in Los Angeles and Austin on Monday, and a town hall in Detroit on Super Tuesday. She did not comment on the goal or thrust of her campaign going forward or whether it was time to bow out.\u00a0 Gabbard has not earned a single delegate in the four races completed thus far. This year, a number of black voters who spoke to CNN expressed ambivalence and indecision about the Democratic contenders, even as former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0has tried to claim President Barack Obama's mantle. Biden\u00a0got the victory he needed\u00a0in South Carolina on Saturday night, winning\u00a0roughly three out of five black voters\u00a0in the state that he has long called his firewall. The question now becomes whether he can carry that momentum into Super Tuesday, and garner similar support in other states. Several new polls in California, North Carolina and Texas underscore the often overlooked fact that the black vote is not a monolith. Read the full story here. Pete Buttigieg will endorse Joe Biden at a rally in Dallas tonight, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, ended his own 2020 bid on Sunday night. Pete Buttigieg\u00a0is weighing whether to endorse\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0after\u00a0exiting\u00a0the Democratic presidential race late Sunday night and later speaking on the phone with the former vice president and former President Barack Obama. An endorsement for Biden is likely, two people close to Buttigieg say, but whether he makes the decision before\u00a0Super Tuesday\u00a0is unclear.

Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar\u00a0will end her presidential bid on Monday and endorse\u00a0Joe Biden, a campaign aide tells CNN. The Klobuchar campaign confirmed that the senator is flying to Dallas to join the former vice president at his rally, where she will suspend her campaign and give her endorsement on the eve of\u00a0Super Tuesday. Klobuchar's path to the nomination all but closed after she posted sixth-place finishes in Nevada and South Carolina, a sign that the Minnesota senator's surprising showing in New Hampshire would not be nearly enough to propel her toward the nomination. A Democratic official told CNN that the Klobuchar campaign was worried that the senator would lose her home state of Minnesota on Tuesday. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the race's front-runner, is holding a rally in the state on Monday night. Read the full story here.
