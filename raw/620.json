Overview The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council has 15 members. There are five permanent members: the United States, the Russian Federation, France, China and the United Kingdom. Ten temporary members are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. UN Security Council Voting To be approved, a Council resolution must have nine \"YES\" votes out of 15 and no \"NO\" votes from any of the five permanent members. Each Council member has one vote.  A \"NO\" vote from one of the five permanent members kills the resolution. There is no such thing as a \"VETO\" vote in formal UN rules, though a \"NO\" vote from a permanent member has the effect of vetoing a resolution. If a member \"ABSTAINS\" from voting, it does not count as either a \"YES\" or \"NO\" vote. Members raise their hands to vote, and sit at a horseshoe-shaped table. Each of the five Permanent Members has gone to war or invaded a country without Security Council approval. Security Council Vetoes A list of resolutions presented to the Security Council, along with the permanent member negative votes, can be found here.
