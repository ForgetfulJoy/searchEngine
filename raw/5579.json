Coronavirus\u00a0 Fears about the continued spread of the coronavirus have taken a devastating toll on global markets. In the US, a stock market sell-off\u00a0erased more than\u00a0$2\u00a0trillion in wealth in a matter of days and sent the Dow plummeting 1,191 points yesterday, marking the biggest one-day drop in the index's history. Asia Pacific markets, like Japan's Nikkei and South Korea's Kospi,\u00a0have also steadily fallen. Experts say\u00a0the virus, which has infected more than 83,000 and killed at least 2,800 worldwide, is ushering in an economic pandemic. Meanwhile, the coronavirus has reached sub-Saharan Africa, with the first reported case in Lagos, Nigeria.\u00a0Lithuania, Belarus and New Zealand have also reported their first cases. In the US, California announced it is\u00a0monitoring some 8,400 people for the virus. President Trump is trying to temper fears of a major US outbreak. \"It's going to disappear,\" he said during a White House news\u00a0conference. \"One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear.\" 2. Taliban deal The US is expected to ink a deal tomorrow with the Taliban\u00a0that will fulfill President Trump's longstanding promise to get the United States out of its longest-running war. However, not everyone is sold on the idea.\u00a0Nearly two dozen Republican lawmakers have written to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to express serious concerns about the anticipated deal. Under the agreement, the US would draw back its troop presence in Afghanistan if the Taliban significantly reduces violence in the country. The concerned lawmakers want assurances from top defense leaders that the US won't commit to a full withdrawal, share a counterterrorism center with the militant group or engage in any side deals. The Pentagon says it will respond to the 22 authors of the letter.\u00a0 3. Immigration\u00a0 A federal judge in Washington state\u00a0has\u00a0blocked the Trump administration from diverting millions of dollars\u00a0from a project at a\u00a0Naval base there to pay for the southern border wall. Washington is one of many states that\u00a0have sued over Trump's emergency declaration that lets the administration\u00a0dip into Pentagon funds to support the wall's construction. In other immigration news, the Trump administration has introduced a proposal that would triple some fees for immigration court filings, like appeals, asylum applications and cancellations of removal. Some of these forms, which cost $110 now, would cost $975 under the new plan. The added expenses would pose a major challenge to immigrants seeking relief\u00a0and may make some less likely to appeal in deportation cases.\u00a0 4. Syria\u00a0 At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in an aerial attack by Syrian regime forces in Syria's Idlib province. The province is the last rebel-held area of Syria, and Turkish soldiers are there as part of a 2018 peace agreement between Turkey and Russia, the latter of which backs the Syrian government. The attack adds to growing tensions between the countries\u00a0since Syrian government forces have increased air attacks in the area over the last few weeks. Russia's Defense Ministry has denied involvement.\u00a0Turkey has retaliated, its spokesman said. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the last opposition-held territory in Syria in the last two months,\u00a0the UN says. 5. University of Michigan Three former wrestlers from the University of Michigan have accused a university doctor of sexually abusing students and athletes for decades. They allege Robert E. Anderson, who worked at Michigan from 1968 to 2003, molested them during unnecessary medical examinations. Anderson died in 2008. The three men\u00a0attended\u00a0the university between 1972 and\u00a02002. One accuser, Tad\u00a0Deluca, says he spoke up about Anderson's alleged conduct as early as 1975 and again in 2018, after allegations against Michigan State University gymnastics team doctor\u00a0and convicted abuser Larry Nassar came to light. Both times, he said, he was ignored. The University has begun a police investigation and opened a hotline for any other victims to step forward.\u00a0\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Rod Blagojevich is charging $100 for personalized shout-outs on the video message website Cameo He says he's available for birthday greetings, anniversary greetings or motivational messages.
