That means tomorrow, \"It's Gonna Be May.\" And *NSYNC will never let Justin Timberlake forget it. To those who don't have that song stuck in their heads yet, allow us to educate you on the evolution of those infamous memes of Timberlake. Back in Timberlake's boy band days, a meme was born from *NSYNC's song \"It's Going To Be Me,\" from their \"No Strings Attached\" album.
