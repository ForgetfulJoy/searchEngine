Football, in particular, has been severely affected with all of Europe's major leagues now suspended for the foreseeable future.  However, for those fans desperate for a football fix, there are still some leagues around the world that are playing on.

Dynamo Brest has invited its new-found fan-base to pay for their face to appear on mannequins within the ground, with the money raised being donated to the fight against coronavirus.

The Chinese Professional Baseball League was due to begin on Saturday but a rain delay meant the season instead started on Sunday with a match between Chinatrust Brothers and the Uni-President Lions at Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. No fans were allowed to watch from within the stadium but the game was broadcast live. Baseball team Rakuten Monkeys had filled parts of its stadiums with mannequins and robotic drummers for the proposed curtain-raiser on Saturday.  Taiwan has managed to limit the spread of confirmed coronavirus cases to just 393 and six deaths, according to the latest figures.  Horse racing has also managed to continue in a number of countries across the world, albeit behind closed doors.  Tracks in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Sweden are among those to have continued racing through the crisis.  Meanwhile, the world of esports is continuing the thrive in the absence of mainstream sport with hoards of professional athletes turning their attention to gaming. "], "Language": false}
