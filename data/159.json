The number of deaths from the novel coronavirus worldwide has surpassed a quarter of a million, according to a tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University. Johns Hopkins reported 250,687 deaths and\u00a03,573,864 total confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide as of 6 p.m. ET\u00a0Monday. Israel unveiled its comprehensive exit plan Monday evening as the country prepares to reopen malls and open-air markets in an easing of the restrictions imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus. Markets and malls will reopen Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced, laying out the latest regulations. He added that the key to reopening more of the economy would depend on social distancing, hygiene, and the wearing of masks. Netanyahu warned that the country\u2019s gradual emergence from lockdown was conditional upon coronavirus figures maintaining their downward trend. Among the announcements, citizens will no longer be required to remain within 100 meters of their homes. In addition, gatherings of up to 20 people will be permitted, as well as weddings of up to 50 people, though dancing remains forbidden in order to maintain social distancing.\u00a0 It is now permissible to visit immediate family, including the elderly, Netanyahu said, but physical contact must still be avoided. Kindergarten and daycares will open on Sunday. Sports and leisure facilities will gradually reopen by mid-June.  Netanyahu warned that a second and more serious wave of coronavirus infections remains possible. He laid out a metric for determining if restrictions need to be reimposed. He said the gradual reopening would have to stop immediately, and new restrictions would be put in place if... There are more than 100 new infections a day\nThe rate of infection doubles within 10 days\nThere are more than 250 patients in serious condition As of Monday evening, the Ministry of Health reported 16,246 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Israel, an increase of only 44 in the past 24 hours. The ministry reported 235 deaths as a result of the virus. ##Daily Life## Doctors at a Paris hospital claim to have found evidence a patient who got sick in December was infected with the novel coronavirus. If verified, it may show the virus was circulating in Europe as early as December. The first reports of Covid-19 in France were reported on Jan. 24, in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan, China. \u201cCovid-19 was already spreading in France in late December 2019, a month before the official first cases in the country,\u201d the team at\u00a0Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine in Saint-Denis\u00a0wrote. Yves Cohen and colleagues at the Paris hospital decided to check the records of patients who got sick before the Jan. 24 cases to see if the virus may have been spreading undetected earlier than first thought. The French team looked at people admitted to the hospital with flu-like illnesses between Dec. 2 and Jan. 16 who were not subsequently diagnosed with influenza. The doctors re-tested samples stored in a freezer for coronavirus. \u201cOne sample was positive, taken from a 42-year-old man born in Algeria, who lived in France for many years and worked as a fishmonger,\u201d the team wrote in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. \u201cHis last trip was in Algeria during August 2019,\u201d they wrote. The man had not been to China, and one of his children had also been sick, the team reported. \u201cIdentifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 and its spreading in the country. Moreover, the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December 2019,\u201d they wrote.\u00a0 Remember: This claim has not yet been independently verified. Europe did not start reporting cases of coronavirus until January. In Italy, the European country hit hardest by the virus, the first two cases were reported\u00a0on Jan. 31, in two Chinese tourists in Rome. The first known community transmission was recorded in February in Codogno, in northern Italy.\u00a0 ##Health## ##Travel## Brazil\u2019s Defense Ministry issued an unusual statement today declaring the armed forces are committed to democracy and institutional \u201charmony\" amid the government's controversial response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Syrian state-run news reports that Assad said the current low numbers of cases does not mean \u201cwe have gone out of the circle of danger.\" These small figures could suddenly spike in a few days or few weeks and we would face a real catastrophe that can overwhelm our health systems,\" Assad said. He praised his country's efforts to combat the pandemic. \"The response and awareness of citizens, in addition to the swift actions of the state, played a main role in slowing the spread of the coronavirus,\" Assad said.

A face mask was projected onto the statue to promote self care amid the coronavirus pandemic and as a tribute to healthcare workers. The text #MascaraSalva, which translates to masks saves, was also displayed on the statue's torso. The statue was closed to the public in mid-March. Standing atop Mount Corcovado, it has long been a major draw for visitors and tourists. This is the third time special lighting has been used on the monument as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the statue was illuminated with the flags of countries impacted by the pandemic.\u00a0 On Easter Sunday, images of medical workers were projected onto the statue as a tribute to those risking their lives on the front lines to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Brazilian health authorities announced Sunday the country has surpassed 100,000 confirmed cases of the virus and over 7,000 reported deaths. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## How normal are things in Athens right now? On the day the country began to ease its strict lockdown measures, environmentalists took to the steps of parliament to protest proposed legislation. Greece has largely avoided the Covid-19 epidemic, with just 146 deaths total. The government acted fast to implement a strict lockdown, before there was even a single death.  On Monday, the first measures were eased: Some small businesses were allowed to open, and Greeks no longer have to register with the government in advance of leaving their homes. The bill proposed by the government would simplify regulations around land use, protected areas, and energy; a vote in parliament is expected Tuesday. \u201cThis cannot wait,\u201d Athanassia Tsirtavi, president of environmental group Peripolo told CNN by phone. \u201cThe changes the government is planning are very serious and they will further harm the environment. The time to act is now.\u201d \u201cThese are people who have been complying with the measures, most had barely exited their houses for weeks,\" Tsirtavi said. In an exclusive interview on Sunday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told CNN that he saw the pandemic as an opportunity to rally the world to take on the even bigger challenge of climate change. \u201cI\u2019ve been making the case for a green transition in Greece since I first got elected,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one maybe good thing that came out of this pandemic, it proved that if we if we can all work together towards a common cause.\u201d ##Health## ##Daily Life## The UK government has launched its first test of a coronavirus contact tracing app today on a small island off the south coast of England.\u00a0 Using bluetooth technology, the app will alert users if they have been near someone who has tested positive for the virus. Developed by the National Health Service (NHS), the app will also upload information to a central database to help public health experts study the behavior of the virus.\u00a0 Unlike Germany, the UK has chosen not to use technology jointly developed by Google and Apple that would only store data locally on individual devices. Instead, the anonymous user data will be encrypted and stored by the health authority in keeping with UK privacy rules.\u00a0 The government hopes more than half of the 80,000 households on the Isle of Wight will download the app after its launch Monday. If the test is successful, the app will be rolled out across the country later this month. Such apps can be highly effective in stopping mass infections, according to Christophe Fraser, an infectious diseases expert at Oxford University who is helping to develop the UK app and has extensively investigated outbreaks of SARS, H1N1 and Ebola.  If people are alerted that they may have been exposed to the virus, they can take steps to prevent further transmission. However, to be really be effective at stemming the virus, at least 60% of the population would need to download and use the app.\u00a0 In addition to the app, the UK government wants to hire 18,000 contact tracers in the next few weeks as part of its overall efforts to keep track of the virus once lockdown measures have been eased. Contact tracers will track where an infected person has been and who they may have come into contact with.

All three incidents, which are being investigated by Russian law enforcement authorities, have prompted intense discussion in the Russian press and on social media. Alexander Shulepov, an ambulance doctor in Voronezh, a city\u00a0about\u00a0320 miles south of Moscow, is in serious condition after falling from a hospital window on Saturday. Local state television, citing regional health officials, said he fell out of second-floor window of the Novousmanskaya hospital, where he worked and was receiving treatment after testing positive for coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 Shulepov was hospitalized for coronavirus on April 22, the same day he and his colleague Alexander Kosyakin posted a video online saying that Shulepov had been forced to continue working after testing positive for coronavirus.\u00a0 Kosyakin\u00a0had also previously criticized hospital administration for protective gear shortages on his social media\u00a0and was questioned by the police for allegedly spreading fake news.\u00a0 Police have not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The Novousmanskaya hospital said in a statement that Shulepov had been taken off a shift as soon as he informed the hospital administration about his positive diagnosis and was offered hospitalization in the infectious diseases ward.\u00a0 Three days later, Shulepov retracted his previous statements, saying that in his video with Kosyakin he was \u201coverwhelmed by emotions.\u201d The second video Shulepov recorded featured Igor Potanin, the head doctor of the Novousmanskaya hospital, who said his medical staff has enough protective equipment. Shulepov was the third health worker in Russia to fall out of a window in the past two weeks.\u00a0 Last Friday, Elena Nepomnyashchaya, the acting head doctor of a hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, died after spending a week in intensive care, the regional department of the Health Ministry said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0 Local TV station TVK Krasnoyarsk reported Nepomnyashchaya\u00a0allegedly\u00a0fell out of a window during a meeting with regional health officials, during which they discussed turning the clinic into a coronavirus facility.\u00a0\u00a0 Nepomnyashchaya was reported to have opposed those changes due to the lack of protective gear in the hospital.\u00a0The Health Ministry\u2019s regional health department denied the allegations in a statement, adding that the hospital is in \"reserve\" for coronavirus patients and its staff has been trained and equipped.\u00a0The hospital\u00a0did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\u00a0 On April 24, Natalya Lebedeva, head of the\u00a0emergency medical service\u00a0at Star City, the main training base for Russia\u2019s cosmonauts, died in a hospital after a fall. The hospital within the Federal Biomedical Agency,\u00a0which says it\u00a0treated her for suspected coronavirus, released a statement\u00a0that \"a tragic accident\u201d\u00a0occurred, without elaborating.\u00a0 The hospital did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. In the statement, the hospital said, \u201cShe was a true professional\u00a0in her field, saving human lives every day!\u201d ##Health## ##Daily Life##  At least 28,734 people have died from the novel coronavirus in the UK, the country's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said today.\u00a0 That's a rise of 288 from the day before, which is the lowest daily increase in the death toll since the end of March. Hancock cautioned the figures tend to be lower after the weekend because of a lag in reporting, and added that number is expected to rise. The total number of tests performed in the UK so far is\u00a01,291,000. The daily testing capacity in Britain stands at 108,000.\u00a0\u00a0 The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases is 190,584, up by 3,985 from the day before. There are currently\u00a013,258\u00a0coronavirus patients in hospital, the UK Health Secretary said. ##Health##\u00a0 Norwegian Air shareholders voted in favor of a proposed rescue plan, helping the budget carrier unlock government aid and avoid bankruptcy. During the global coronavirus outbreak, the airline has canceled almost all flights and said it would temporarily lay off 90% of its workforce. How the plan works: It will proceed with a large debt for equity swap, which is when creditors swap their company debt loans for shares. It will also raise up to $38 million equity by issuing more shares.\u00a0 Norwegian Air said in statement it expects to convert more than 10 billion Norwegian Krone of debt into equity. That is about $960 million USD. The measures will enable the airline to qualify for state aid of 3 billion Norwegian Krone, around $288.7 million USD.\u00a0 ##Business## ##Travel## Iran has reported 74 additional coronavirus-related deaths and 1,223 new cases over the past 24 hours \u2013 a slight jump from Sunday\u2019s numbers. Iran\u2019s Health Ministry spokesperson Kianoush Jahanpour said the country\u2019s total number of cases is 98,647. Of those, 6,203 people have died. Another 2,676 patients remain in intensive care in a critical condition.\u00a0 \"So far, 508,288 PCR tests have been carried in more than 130 labs across the country,\" Jahanpour added. What this is about: Polymerase chain reaction tests, known as PCR, are the most common and most accurate tests\u00a0for determining whether someone is currently infected with the novel coronavirus. Mosques in Iran reopened today in 132 cities part of the plan to ease restrictions.\u00a0Friday prayers, which the government banned in early March in provinces across the country, will also resume in low-risk areas. ##Daily Life## Millions across Europe are returning to some semblance of their former lives today as more countries across the continent begin to reopen after weeks \u2014 or months \u2014 of coronavirus-related lockdowns. But not everyone is happy with how the \"new normal\" looks. Italian businesses are wondering how they'll survive as restrictions are eased but not fully lifted. More more than four million people are expected to return to work today with many businesses set to reopen.  But the owner of the Il Bello Cafe bar in Rome, said the partial easing of restrictions would not be enough to keep many establishments afloat.\u00a0Franco, who declined to give his last name, told CNN he's only making 30% of what he was making before the lockdown. I just reopened today, but it's not even worth it. There is so little work for us, few people are coming in, but also the bar isn't about just buying a coffee, or cappuccino, it's about a conversation. It's social,\" he said.  Students are heading back to socially-distanced schools in Germany, where newly reopened barber shops are facing huge demand to right the wrongs of weeks of home haircuts. One salon in Hamburg said it was \"overrun\" by customers, while Udo Walz, a hairdresser to the stars in Berlin, told CNN his salons were booked out for the next three weeks. Other European countries are gradually relaxing restrictions. Spain allowed people outside for solo exercise this weekend for the first time in seven weeks. Portugal opens small stores Monday, and people in Belgium may travel on public transport but must wear masks.\u00a0 Traffic increased in Greece today as small stores including hair salons, flower shops and bookstores reopened and lines formed outside electrical appliance retailers. The country is planning to welcome tourists again this summer.\u00a0 As Europe reopens, the big question is how the once vibrant continent will look as we move into a different future to the one we all expected. It has certainly changed forever. Read the full story here. ##Daily Life## The European Union started an international conference on the search for vaccines and coronavirus treatment by pledging one billion euros to the cause. That is about $1.09 billion USD.\u00a0 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the virtual Coronavirus Global Response conference the initial aim is to raise 7.5 billion euros, or $8 billion USD, to ramp up immediate work, but more will be needed. She described it as the start of a global \"pledging marathon\". The reality is we will have to live with the virus until and unless we develop a vaccine and this is why we have to join forces and pool our money and our minds to kick-start work on vaccines, diagnostics and treatments against coronavirus,\" the EU Commission President said.  ##Daily Life## Japan will extend its state of emergency until May 31, but the country must prepare for a \u201clife with coronavirus,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a task force meeting today. Some prefectures with a high infection rate, including Tokyo and Osaka, will keep working to reduce social contact by 80% to stem the spread of the virus. The rest of the nation may begin easing restrictions for small businesses, such as restaurants and cultural facilities, with appropriate prevention measures.  If the current strict measures continues, we would not be able to sustain our living and economy. We must make a step toward a life with coronavirus,\" Abe said.\u00a0 Abe said he will review the infection status around May 14 to see if the order can be lifted earlier.  He said the country\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d approach of cluster tracing during lockdown has helped it avoid what he called an explosive outburst of infection seen in other countries. Japan's state of emergency gives the authority to local governors to request residents stay indoors and suspend businesses, although it cannot force lockdown measures with penalties. ##Daily Life## Germany's border checks will continue until at least next Friday, May 15, the Interior ministry said.  Germany is part of the European open-border Schengen area, which imposed emergency border checks to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The group of 26 European countries \u2014 including Spain, France, Greece, Germany, Italy and Poland \u2014 do not have internal borders and usually allow people to move between them freely. The ministry said the extension of the border checks is in line with the EU commission. \"Of course, we are guided by the European spirit not to act unilaterally or in an uncoordinated way,\" the spokesman added.  ##Daily Life## Ukraine has extended its nationwide lockdown until May 22 but has agreed to loosen some restrictions starting on May 11, the government announced in a televised cabinet meeting today. The partial lifting of some restrictions on May 11 will include the reopening of parks, some specialist shops and cafes for take out services. Ukraine has reported at least 12,331 Covid-19 cases and 303 deaths as of May 4, according to the Health Ministry. The country\u2019s lockdown began on March 12.  ##Daily Life## German hairdressers are allowed to open today after being closed for many weeks over the threat of coronavirus.  Customers must have a pre-booked appointment, and in Berlin, they will have to fill out a personal questionnaire. Berlin hairdresser to the stars Udo Walz, told CNN he is booked out for three weeks in advance. His Berlin salons have been closed for six weeks. \"I was in the shop this morning, everyone is wearing masks, the customers, the hairdressers, it is a bit funny,\" Walz said.  To adhere to social distancing, Walz said every other chair remains empty, which works for him as he has big salons.  \"Most of the customers have two centimeters of roots showing. Some of them tried to cut their hair themselves or cover up the color, but that usually went wrong, although I gave tips on the telephone,\" he said. Walz \u2014 who has styled hair for Marlene Dietrich, Nancy Reagan and Gwyneth Paltrow \u2014 said he has not yet had to lay off any of his 86 employees, but his hairdressers are still hurting financially. \u201cThey did not get tips and that is important as we have a good clientele. Their salary was reduced a bit, but we have a great team,\" he said. Meanwhile, Anne Bruemmer, the owner of Salon Heidi in Hamburg, told CNN they are booked two weeks in advance.  In addition to wearing masks, Bruemmer said she must keep a distance of at least 1.5 meters \u2014 or about 5 feet \u2014 between customers. Her salon is disinfecting seats, door handles and anything else that may have been touched.  If she's caught violating the health and safety measures, Bruemmer said she may be fined upwards of 500 Euros, or about $547 USD. \"Customers are generally very safe here,\u201d Bruemmer said.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## Spain has begun its transition into a new phase of de-escalation toward a \"new normal\" Monday as the country\u2019s health authorities report a second day of record low Covid-19 new infections and deaths. The country is seeing \u201cthe lowest number of cases in two months\u201d by percentage, said Dr.\u00a0Fernando Sim\u00f3n, Spain\u2019s Director for Health Emergencies, speaking at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus technical briefing. Spain's\u00a0Ministry of Health has reported a record low 0.16% rise of new coronavirus infection cases confirmed by PCR\u00a0(Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests, since Sunday.\u00a0 The number of deaths rose by 164 in the last 24 hours, bringing the cumulative number of deaths to 25,428 since the start of the pandemic in Spain. The number of daily recoveries outnumber new infections, but Sim\u00f3n cautioned that even though the data is good, it doesn't \"eliminate risk,\" and noted that the positive coronavirus cases figures could be adjusted in the coming days due to delayed weekend holiday reporting. When asked whether relaxation of the country\u2019s restrictions will mean a new wave of infections, Sim\u00f3n said health authorities are working on early detection to\u00a0know\u00a0the number of possible cases much more quickly.\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of the\u00a0[current]\u00a0periods that can be of up to 10, in some cases 15 days, we want this to be reduced,\u00a0if\u00a0possible\u201d Simon said, adding \u201cthe objective is a maximum of 48 hours\u201d. The\u00a0faster detection and tracking\u00a0will \u201cguarantee that from the moment you move from one phase to the other, the regions are prepared to respond correctly in case of a\u00a0[new]\u00a0outbreak\u201d, Sim\u00f3n explained. When asked about the possibility of Spain\u00a0using\u00a0apps to track the contagion, Sim\u00f3n said:\u00a0\u201cWhat we need to know is what added value these apps bring to the systems that we already have in place, or that we are putting place to do contact tracing.\u201d\u00a0 He also\u00a0noted\u00a0that Spain has restrictive data protection laws, so those would need to be taken into consideration \u201cto be sure that they [the apps] don\u2019t infringe on other rights in an irreversible way.\u201d  Restrictions eased: Spain started a transition out of eight weeks of strict restrictions on Monday, under the country\u2019s state of emergency, which has been in place since March 14.\u00a0 \u00a0##Daily Life## ##Health## In a U-turn, the Indian government announced that it will cover the train fare cost incurred for the transportation of stranded migrant workers, students and tourists to return home. \u201cBoth the Government of India or the Railway Ministry have not discussed charging any of the workers. Eighty-five percent of the fare will be borne by the Central government and 15 percent by the state government,\u201d\u00a0said Lav Agarwal, a senior official for the Ministry of Health said.

In his final moments, Ananda Mooliya reassured his wife and two sons that he was fine, though they could hear his labored breathing from the next room, over the sound of the TV.

His mouth was open. \"I wiped his face,\" Attavar recalled through tears. \"Then I called out his name. He didn't respond.\" She sprinkled water on his head.

Trump's comments, at the memorial in Washington to a president assassinated after emancipating the slaves during the Civil War, are likely to further polarize the raging politics of a current crisis that is stretching national unity. \"I am greeted with a hostile press the likes of which no president has ever seen,\" Trump said at the Fox News town hall Sunday night.\n\"The closest would be that gentleman right up there,\" Trump said, pointing to the 16th President's statue. \"They always said nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse.\" Trump was speaking at the time of a\u00a0widening divide between states\u00a0that are opening economies and others that are warning of premature declarations of victory amid soaring tensions fomented by weeks of coronavirus lockdowns. His statement was classic Trump, not just in his audacity of comparing himself to the man many historians rate as the greatest president, but in his tendency to make every issue -- even in the midst of a national tragedy in which tens of thousands of Americans have died -- about himself.

While praising the US response to the outbreak during a\u00a0Fox News\u00a0town hall, Trump said, \"That's one of the reasons we're successful, if you call losing 80 or 90,000 people successful.\" \"But it's one of the reasons we're not at the high end of that plane as opposed to the low end of the plane,\" the President continued. When pressed on his shifting estimate, Trump conceded, \"I used to say 65,000 and now I'm saying 80 or 90 and it goes up and it goes up rapidly.\" \"But it's still going to be, no matter how you look at it, at the very lower end of the plane if we did the shutdown,\" he said.

When pressed on why he had previously said 65,000 people would die, Trump said \"it goes up rapidly.\" The US death toll stands at 67,680, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nAbe expected to extend state of emergency: Japan's Prime Minister will make an announcement today on the lockdown measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. According to Japan's public broadcaster NHK, Abe is likely to extend the state of emergency until May 31.\nItaly to cautiously reopen: From Monday, Italy has announced it will loosen some restrictions as the number of new infections continues to drop, including allowing funerals with up to 15 attendees. Italy has been one of the worst-affected countries by the pandemic, with more than 210,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.\nBrazil infections rise above 100,000: At least 101,147 infections have been recorded in Brazil -- the most cases of any country in South America. More than 7,000 people have died of the virus in the country. US secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0on Sunday stepped up administration claims that China mounted efforts to hide the extent of the coronavirus spread, including concealing the severity while stockpiling medical supplies. \"You've got the facts just about right,\"\u00a0Pompeo told ABC's \"This Week\"\u00a0when asked if China intentionally stockpiled medical supplies in early January while it concealed the severity of Covid-19.  \"We can confirm that the Chinese Communist Party did all that it could to make sure that the world didn't learn in a timely fashion about what was taking place.\" Pompeo's comments come as the\u00a0Trump administration is formulating a long-term plan\u00a0to punish China on multiple fronts for the coronavirus pandemic, injecting a rancorous new element into a critical relationship already on a steep downward slide. Multiple sources inside the administration say that there is an appetite to use various tools, including sanctions, canceling US debt obligations and drawing up new trade policies, to make clear to China, and to everyone else, where they feel the responsibility lies. While there are serious questions about China's transparency, the Trump administration has escalated its effort to blame China for the global spread of the virus as criticism of its own handling of the pandemic has increased.  Read more: The Chinese government intentionally\u00a0concealed the severity of Covid-19 from the international community while\u00a0it stockpiled imports and decreased exports, a Department of Homeland Security report found, according to an administration official familiar with the report. \"China likely cut its exports of medical supplies prior to its January WHO (World Health Organization) notification that COVID-19 is a contagion,\" the report reads, according to the source.\u00a0 The report, which assessed export and import data earlier this year, was circulated within the federal government on Friday, the source said. The DHS assessment also says, \"in its communications, China intentionally concealed its trade activity by publicly denying it has ever imposed an export ban on masks and other medical supplies,\" according to the source.\u00a0 The findings were assessed at \"moderate confidence,\" the source told CNN, pointing out that the report does not conclude whether the actions of the Chinese government were nefarious.\u00a0It is reasonable to conclude that based on the outbreak, before it was declared\u00a0a pandemic, that China would recognize key measurements in determining requirements for the need of personal protective equipment, said the source.\u00a0 The US needs \"to be mindful about, 'what do you do about it?'\" said the source. \"Is this a trigger that propels industry here? Will there\u00a0be enough in the stockpile\" going forward? questioned the source.\u00a0 China has access to a wide array of raw materials that are necessary\u00a0in establishing a production line of goods that are necessary in response\u00a0to the Covid-19 pandemic, said the source, whether it\u2019s surgical gowns, masks, or goggles. \"They have a robust manufacturing capability and workforce that can quickly ramp up manufacturing,\" said the source.\u00a0 ABC first reported the existence of the report. When asked about whether he thought the origination of the coronavirus was nefarious or a mistake on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said he believes it was \u201ca horrible mistake.\u201d\u00a0 During a town hall on Fox News Sunday, Trump added that China \u201cdidn\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d and that China was embarrassed by the problem and was unable to \u201cput the fire out.\u201d Both Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have said they believe the virus had its origins in a lab in Wuhan, China, and not at a market in the city, but neither provided evidence. Earlier in the week, Trump implied that China knowingly let the virus spread around the globe. \"They either didn't do it and, you know, they couldn't do it from a competence standpoint, or they let it spread. And I -- you know, I would say probably it was -- got -- it got out of control,\" Trump said. \n\u201cThey are a very brilliant nation, scientifically and otherwise. It got loose, let's say, and they could have capped it, they could have stopped it, but they didn't,\u201d he added. During the town hall, Trump also seemed to indicate that he will make public a \u201cstrong report on exactly what we think happened\u201d in regards to the origin of the virus, and that the report will be \u201cvery conclusive.\u201d ##Health## US Vice President Mike Pence has admitted during a Fox News town hall that he should have worn a mask on his visit to the Mayo Clinic last week. Pence said he originally \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was necessary\u201d because he is tested for the coronavirus frequently, but went on to say, \u201cI should have worn a mask at the Mayo Clinic.\u201d\u00a0 A\u00a0person involved in planning the visit previously told CNN\u00a0that Mayo Clinic\u00a0staff briefed Pence's team about the clinic's policy requiring face masks.\u00a0\u00a0 Another source familiar with discussions\u00a0said\u00a0it\u00a0was clear that despite what\u00a0Pence originally\u00a0said in defending himself and not wearing a mask, that Pence's staff understood\u00a0it was a mistake.  However, the next day a VP\u00a0spokesperson told\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0Jim Acosta,\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t feel it was a mistake.\u201d China's National Health Commission reported three new cases of the novel coronavirus today, as domestic tourism surged during the Labor Day \"golden week\" holiday.

Following eight weeks of strict confinement since a countrywide state of emergency was declared on March 14, the process of transition in Spain will be gradual.\u00a0 The four phases will be determined by a \u201cseries of indicators, such as the strategic capacities available in the health care system,\" officials say. Some of these indicators include being able to test and identify sources of contagion and the ability to isolate and control those sources. Spain's health ministry said another key to reopening the economy is the availability of hospital beds. For every 10,000 residents, hospitals have to be able to add between 1.5 to 2 intensive care unit beds, and between 37 to 40 beds for severely ill patients, as outlined by the ministry. Across Spain, masks will be mandatory on public transport\u00a0as of Monday. Here are some of the reopening guidelines for businesses: Hotel and restaurant terraces will be able to\u00a0operate at\u00a050% of capacity, but will have to clean and disinfect tables, chairs, and other surfaces, between clients.\nSmall retail and commercial businesses will be open to the public at 30% capacity, and will offer priority service to people over 65.\nClothing stores will be required to disinfect fitting areas, and \"hygiene any garment before other clients have access to it.\"\nBusinesses are responsible for providing personal protective equipment to their employees. ##Daily Life## Afghanistan released 98 Taliban prisoners from Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul on Saturday evening as part of the government\u2019s efforts to contain coronavirus, according to a statement from the National Directorate of Security. The release is in line with a decree Afghan President Ashraf Ghani signed on\u00a0March 11 to release Taliban prisoners as the peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban began. The prisoners were released based on their health conditions, age, and length of remaining sentence. So far, 650 Taliban prisoners have been released since March 10, and the government will release 850 more, the statement added. \u201cThe government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan remains open continuing joint technical work with the Taliban in order to advance the peace process,\u201d the statement read. US President Donald Trump said Sunday night that he was first briefed about the novel coronavirus on January 23 and indicated the US intelligence agencies would be issuing a statement in the coming days. \"On January 23, I was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was of no real import. In other words it wasn\u2019t, \u2018Oh we gotta do something, we gotta do something.\u2019 It was a brief conversation and it was only on January 23,\" Trump said on Fox News. But while Trump claims he was told that \"there could be a virus coming,\" that January 23 briefing came three days after the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the United States. The President was also briefed by his Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about the threat of the coronavirus during a January 18 phone call, according to multiple reports. Trump also said that at the time the US intelligence community was not \"competently run.\" \"And the intelligence agencies, which have now -- now, now -- because before they weren't, which are now very competently run with some great people ... the intelligence agencies will tell you that tomorrow,\" Trump said. CNN and other news outlets have reported that the President's daily intelligence briefing included information about the coronavirus outbreak in China and its potential to spread to the United States as early as January 3.  It is not clear whether Trump -- who infrequently reads the President's Daily Brief compiled by intelligence officials -- read the information at the time or whether officials briefing the President in person raised the issue. A total of 373 employees and contract workers at Triumph Foods, a pork processing plant in Buchanan County, Missouri, have tested positive for coronavirus despite showing no related symptoms, according to a news release from the Department of Health and Senior Services. \u201cWe continue to work this weekend contacting these asymptomatic patients and have initiated the process of contact tracing with those determined to be close contacts of our positive cases,\u201d said Dr. Randall Williams, director of DHSS.\u00a0 The department encouraged anyone experiencing symptoms to reach out to their health care provider, the release said. The latest numbers come after the the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services announced Thursday\u00a0more than 120 employees tested positive for Covid-19. ##Business## Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told reporters Sunday that the state's Covid-19 cases were \"at the worst\" plateauing. He commended Kentucky residents for sticking to the state's guidelines. \"You are saving thousands of lives,\" he said. \"I'm very proud to be your governor.\" Saying that he took yesterday off in order to recharge, Beshear gave both Saturday and Sunday numbers for cases and deaths. Saturday's report showed an additional 173 cases, with five deaths. Sunday's report showed 80 new cases and no deaths, but Beshear himself cast doubt on those numbers, saying there had been a lull in testing. \"This is why we average,\" he said. \"No day right now just has 80.\" He added that a report will come out tomorrow on cases in Green River State Prison. \"We believe they are going to be tough numbers to see,\" he said. Beshear also responded to yesterday's protest over pandemic measures by calling it \"reckless.\" \"All I asked that folks did if they disagree is to do it safely,\" he said. \"What I have heard is that speakers, and leaders, and even state representatives or state senators asked people to take off their masks, told people that social distancing is optional, and one even said they're not going to take the vaccine when it's created. That's just reckless.\" Beshear said more test kits will be arriving in the state in the coming week, and that over the course of the next few days he will be focusing on preparing businesses for phased reopenings. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Business## France will not impose a 14-day quarantine on travelers from the Schengen area of the European Union or the UK, the Elys\u00e9e Palace confirmed to CNN on Sunday. This is regardless of the nationality of those traveling to France.
