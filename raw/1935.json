Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.  (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. New Hampshire Poll watchers went into the New Hampshire primary hoping for a clearer picture of the Democratic presidential field, and that's what they got ... kind of. Bernie Sanders landed\u00a0the proper victory that the Iowa caucus debacle had denied him, but Pete Buttigieg was hot on his heels again. The former mayor actually still has a slight lead in the overall delegate count, but that could change when the race shifts to South Carolina and Nevada, which is considered a strong state for Sanders. Amy Klobuchar netted a strong third-place finish in New Hampshire,\u00a0which is what her campaign had hoped\u00a0for. That left\u00a0Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, the other top candidates, struggling with disappointing results. Biden didn't even stick around in the Granite State, opting instead to move on to South Carolina. He's hoping the state's\u00a0more diverse voter base will give him the boost he needs in its primary at the end of the month. New Hampshire was also the final stop for entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who announced the end of his campaign as soon as the results were called.\u00a0 2. Roger Stone\u00a0 All four federal prosecutors in the Roger Stone case have withdrawn from it after a surprise sentencing shift\u00a0raised troubling questions about the motivations of top Justice Department\u00a0officials. Here's how it went down: Stone was convicted of lying to Congress and tampering with witnesses during the Russia investigation. The prosecutors this week asked a federal judge to sentence him to seven to nine years in prison. Then, President Trump publicly\u00a0voiced his displeasure with the request, calling the situation \"very unfair\" and \"disgraceful.\" Hours later,\u00a0the Justice Department issued an updated sentencing recommendation\u00a0asking for less time for Stone, undercutting the prosecutors' initial request.\u00a0This prompted the mass withdrawal, as well as sharp criticism from Democrats who claim the President unjustly used his power to influence the suggested sentence. Trump says he didn't ask the Justice Department to do anything\u00a0but had the \"absolute right to,\" if he wanted.\u00a0 3. Coronavirus\u00a0 The number of new coronavirus cases in mainland China appears\u00a0to have leveled off for the first time in weeks, which could signal a small reprieve in the epidemic. Or, it could just invite new questions about\u00a0testing methods and the virus' incubation period. Health officials in Hong Kong are also investigating whether the virus can be spread through pipes and drains\u00a0after two residents on different floors of an apartment building were infected. Pipes were a major source of transmission during the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s. Meanwhile, concerns are mounting over the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan. Forty more cases of the virus were confirmed on board, bringing the\u00a0total to 175. Workers on the ship are pleading for help, saying they have been forced to keep working and interacting with potentially infected passengers with no protection for themselves.\u00a0 4. Ireland Four men have been arrested in Northern Ireland over last year's murder of Northern Irish journalist Lyra McKee. The men were taken into custody under the country's anti-terror legislation, since the New IRA, a dissident Republican group,\u00a0admitted to and apologized for her death. McKee, a 29-year-old journalist and LGBT activist, was shot dead during a night of political unrest near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Her death temporarily united leaders from across\u00a0the normally fractious Irish political scene\u00a0and cast the ongoing struggle between Irish nationalists and British unionists in a newly tragic light.\u00a0 5. Jussie Smollett Former \"Empire\" star Jussie Smollett has been indicted by a grand jury on six counts for\u00a0making false reports in connection with the actor's claim last January that he was the victim of\u00a0a racist and homophobic attack near his Chicago apartment. Police eventually concluded Smollett orchestrated the attack himself to boost his publicity\u00a0and paid two acquaintances to help him set it up. Initially, the actor was indicted on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct, but the charges were\u00a0dropped weeks later. These new charges come after a special prosecutor was asked to investigate how local prosecutors handled Smollett's case. Smollett's attorney has denied any wrongdoing by the actor\u00a0and says the new charges are \"all about politics, not justice.\" The prosecutor who dropped the initial charges is up for reelection.
