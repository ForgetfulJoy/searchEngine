It's a number staggering enough to trigger an increasing number of single-use plastic bag bans across some major cities and states, including New York, which is moving to limit disposable plastic bags starting March 1.   It's also staggering enough to move more and more people to opt against using plastic bags in their everyday lives, instead choosing reusable nylon or canvas or cotton bags for their shopping needs. So much so that it's become a bona fide fashion trend, with entire companies forming out of the need for more options when it comes to truly reusable, durable bags that are far more eco-friendly. And what that means for us is that there are now more reusable bag options out there than ever before, with some being quite, well, adorable.  A plastic-waste-reduction evangelist myself, my voice hits a fever pitch if I see anyone from my household leaving home without one of the seemingly 96  totes we have hanging in the hall closet. There are so many cute reusable bags, it makes eschewing disposable plastic ones all the more appealing.
