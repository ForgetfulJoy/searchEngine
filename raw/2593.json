The crowd chanted \"Kobe! Kobe!

It is now a misdemeanor for anyone to unlawfully access the site of the helicopter crash. Deputies are patrolling the rugged terrain on horseback, Villanueva said. Road closures and flight restrictions still remain in effect, he said. Only people who have proper identification and can prove they are a resident will be allowed to enter. Villanueva also said that they are still waiting on the coroner to make an identification. \u201cBe patient, it\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d he said. Once notifications are made to the next of kin, media will be notified. The coroner is still recovering human remains from the crash site, Villanueva said. \u00a0 \u00a0 The pilot of the helicopter killed in the crash was experienced, according to Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot was identified as Ara Zobayan, according to the pilot\u2019s neighbor and a former colleague at Island Express helicopter company. Zobayan was among the victims of the crash that killed eight others, including Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna. He had a commercial certificate and 8,200 hours of flight time as of July 2019, Homendy said at a news conference today. He was also a certified flight instructor. Zobayan had been working with Island Express, the helicopter company, for a number of years, she said. The NTSB is looking at pilot records, weather information, ATC communication, and wreckage as part of the investigation. \u00a0 There was no black box \u2014 \u00a0a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder \u2014 onboard the helicopter that carried NBA legend Kobe Bryant and eight others, said Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. According to Homendy, it is not a requirement. There was an iPad, however, which was recovered at the crash site. It is used by the pilot for flight plans and weather briefings, she told reporters today at a news conference. The NTSB will be looking at other avionics to see what information can be gathered. The impact crater is 1,085 feet above sea level, Homendy said as she described the debris field as being about 500 to 600 feet.\u00a0 When asked about any chance for survival, Homendy responded by saying, \u201cIt was a pretty devastating accident scene.\u201d \u201cThere is an impact area on one of the hills and the piece of the tail is down the hill, on the left side of the hill, fuselage is on the other side of the hill, and the main rotor is about a 100 yards beyond that,\u201d she said as she described the scene. The NTSB will be on scene for about five days to collect perishable evidence and continue to document the scene. They will not determine the cause on scene, but Homendy said she is confident they\u2019ll determine the cause of the accident. \u00a0 The FBI is assisting the National Transportation Safety Board to collect evidence from the wreckage of the crash, NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy told reporters today. \"They are essentially a force multiplier for the NTSB,\" she said. \"There is no criminal portion of this investigation,\" she said. Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the agency is looking for photographs showing the weather at the time of the helicopter crash. She urged the public to send any photos to the NTSB. Investigators were also at the scene today and used drones to begin mapping the wreckage, Homendy said. \"It was a pretty devastating accident scene,\" she said. The Empire State Building is lit in purple and gold in tribute to Kobe Bryant tonight, according to the building\u2019s official Twitter account.

They were on their way to an elite basketball game at the Mamba academy, aboard Kobe\u2019s helicopter. We were Gaga and Papa to Payton and wore that title proudly,\" she wrote on Facebook. Harbor Day School, the private school in Corona del Mar that Kobe Bryant's daughter Gianna attended, remembered the 13-year-old as a \"vital part\" of the school's community. \"She was always smiling. She looked out for the underdog and never left anyone out. Gianna was a strong leader, had a work ethic that was unmatched, and had a level of maturity beyond her 13 years,\" the school said in a statement. Harbor View girls' basketball coach Christina Mauser also died in the Sunday crash. The school said she \"put her heart and soul into coaching and teaching physical education.\" Former colleagues of Ara Zobayan, the pilot in the deadly helicopter crash, are remembering him today.

Zobayan was outspoken, he said, a presence with a distinctive voice and big personality. Deetz declined to comment on Zobayan\u2019s experience flying but said he trusted him enough to fly with him. Another fellow pilot, Jared Yochim, told CNN that he too recognized Zobayan\u2019s voice on the recordings. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that people wanted to fly with him,\u201d Yochim said. \u201cHe was just a cool, calm guy.\u201d Yochim said the news of the pilot\u2019s death has shaken a small, tight-knit community of helicopter pilots. He and Deetz cautioned against arm-chair speculation about what may have happened.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to wait for [authorities] to complete an investigation. There may be lessons to be learned,\u201d Yochim said. Neighbors of Ara Zobayan, the pilot who was killed in yesterday's helicopter crash, said he was friendly \u2014 but exacting. Robert Sapia told CNN that Zobayan would often point out details at the Huntington Beach condominium complex that needed tended, such as fallen palm fronds. Another neighbor, Angie LaPorte, said she saw him every day at the mailbox.\u00a0 \u201cHe was kind of a mild-mannered guy,\u201d she said. \u201cAlways pleasant but never super talkative.\u201d\u00a0 LaPorte said she learned of his death when she stepped outside of her condo unit early Monday morning.\u00a0 \u201cI heard from the landscape guys,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all loved him.\u201d\u00a0 Radio stations in Southern California went silent at lunchtime to honor Kobe Bryant, at the request of the Southern California Broadcasters Association.

Watch the full clip here: Kobe Bryant's former pilot Kurt Deetz told CNN the Sikorsky S-76B \u2014 the model of helicopter that crashed yesterday \u2014 is a \"very complex\" aircraft that's meant to be flown by experienced pilots. He called the twin-engine aircraft, known for its luxury, \u201cvery reliable\u201d but he did not know its exact safety record. \u201cThey just don\u2019t fall out of the sky,\u201d Deetz said, adding that that model is considered nearly \u201cbulletproof.\u201d Deetz added that pilots need at least a couple thousand hours flying in a twin engine to be ready to fly the complex helicopter. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people readily qualified to fly it,\" he said. Deetz joined Island Express in 2015 specifically to be Bryant\u2019s pilot, he told CNN.

Basketball legend Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven other people died yesterday when a helicopter crashed in California. The official cause of the crash has not been determined, but here's what we know so far: Visibility was low: The crash happened under foggy conditions in Calabasas, California. Visibility was so low Sunday morning that Los Angeles police had grounded its helicopters, spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.\nBut the helicopter still had clearance to fly: It was operating under \"special visual flight rules,\" according to an air traffic control conversation with the pilot, captured by website LiveATC.net. An SVFR clearance allows a pilot to fly in weather conditions worse than those allowed for standard visual flight rules.\nRecovery efforts and the investigation are difficult: Investigators are struggling to find clues in difficult conditions because the crash site remote, officials said. The effort to recover the victims' bodies has\u00a0started but could take days, given the terrain and the condition of the site. Here's a look at the flight path: For the next seven days, every professional team in all levels of basketball throughout Italy will honor Kobe Bryant with a moment of silence in every game. Italian Basketball Federation's president Giovanni Petrucci told CNN, \"We are shocked and saddened by what happened to him and his daughter Gianna and we hold his family close to our hearts in this moment of sorrow.\" \"It's a small gesture to honor Kobe's memory, but one that is heartfelt and deserved,\" he added. Bryant's connection to Italy: Bryant grew up in Italy during the 1980s when his father played for a series of local teams in the country. He spoke fluent Italian, and spent the formative years of his career playing on the city's youth team Cantine Riunite.  \u00a0The helicopter that crashed yesterday in Calabasas, California, was operating under \u201cSpecial Visual Flight Rules,\u201d according to an air traffic control audio conversation with the pilot, captured by website LiveATC.net.\u00a0 What that means: A SVFR, Special Visual Flight Rules, clearance is given to pilots to allow them to fly in weather conditions worse than those allowed for standard Visual Flight Rules (VFR).\u00a0\u00a0 The Burbank Airport control tower allowed the helicopter to proceed northeast following the I-5 highway using the SVFR clearance.\u00a0 \u201cMaintain special VFR at or below 2,500\u201d the pilot confirmed to the controller.\u00a0 Later in the flight, the pilot apparently asked for \u201cflight following,\u201d a service where controllers are in regular contract with an aircraft.\u00a0The controller was recorded telling the pilot \u201c2 echo x-ray, you\u2019re still too low level for flight following at this time.\u201d\u00a0That could mean the helicopter was too low to be seen on Air Traffic Control radar.\u00a0 Satellite imagery showed the cloud cover at the time of the crash. Below, you can see the flight path in blue: British soccer legend David Beckham shared four photos on Instagram this morning to honor of Kobe Bryant.

And over the years he shared his own thoughts and wisdom on a wide range of subjects. Here's the late Kobe Bryant, in his own words. On sacrifice:  \"We all can be masters at our craft, but you have to make a choice. What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, whatever the case may be. There are sacrifices that come along with making that decision.\" On the cultural contributions of black athletes: \"(They've been) crucial. What we stand for, what America stands for, the cultural melting pot that is America, the diversity that is America, it's all about moving that culture forward. From Muhammad Ali to Bill Russell, that's what they've done, that's what they've pioneered and its our responsibility to try to carry it forward.\" On raising his daughter, Gianna: \"The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans would come up to me and she'll be standing next to me and they'll be like, 'You've gotta have a boy ... You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy.' \"She's like, 'Oy, I got this.\u00a0Don't need no boy for that.' I'm like, that's right. Yes you do, you got this.\" Read more of his words here. Kobe Bryant was a trailblazer -- on and off the court. He finished his high school career as the highest scoring player in the history of southeastern Pennsylvania basketball.\u00a0He became the youngest NBA player\u00a0in history at age 17. Two years ago, he became\u00a0the only athlete to ever win a basketball championship and an Academy Award. But in his last social media posts before his death, Bryant wasn't celebrating another one of his achievements -- he was celebrating someone else. Bryant congratulated Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James for passing him to become the third highest scorer in NBA history with 33,655 points.  \"Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames,\" he tweeted. \"Much respect my brother.\" And on Instagram, Bryant rooted for James to climb even higher on that list. \"On to #2,\" he wrote. \"Keep growing the game and charting the path for the next.\" NBA team Dallas Mavericks will retire the No. 24 jersey in honor of Kobe Bryant, who wore the jersey number while playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.  \"Kobe's legacy transcends basketball, and our organization has decided that the number 24 will never again be worn by a Dallas Maverick,\" said Mark Cuban, Dallas Mavericks owner, in a statement posted on Twitter.  \"Kobe was an ambassador for our game, a decorated legend and a global icon,\" said the statement. \"Above all, he was a loving and dedicated father.\" After Bryant's retirement, the LA Lakers retired both jersey numbers 8 and 24, which Bryant had worn throughout his career.

The Charlotte Hornets also released a statement. Bryant was originally drafted in 1996 by Charlotte before being traded to the Lakers.  \u201cKobe\u2019s toughness on the basketball court was second to none.

We didn\u2019t know then that he was going to be one of the biggest stars in the world.\u201d Kobe's father, Joe Bryant, played in Italy for several years, and was already locally famous when they moved to Reggio Emilia, Giudici said.  \u201cWe spent two years with Kobe and he spoke very fluent, very perfect Italian so he was like a friend of ours,\u201d Giudici said.

He brought it each and every night on both ends of the floor. Not too many guys can say that throughout NBA history. He would lock up on D. Obviously, he was dominant on the offensive side. But any time he was in the game, he would take on their best player and shut them down for all 48 minutes. That was one of the more impressive things throughout his entire career. Then when he ruptured his Achilles and went to the foul line and made his shots, that is tough,\" Woods said. There was extremely low visibility at the time of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and eight other people, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said.
