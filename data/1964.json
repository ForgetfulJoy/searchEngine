Areas in the Southeast\u00a0will\u00a0be battered for the next few days with constant rain, which could lead to some dangerous flooding.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.  (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. New Hampshire\u00a0 Votes are already rolling in in the New Hampshire primaries, the second stop on the campaign trail for the tight pack of Democratic presidential candidates. Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders is the favorite to win the contest, but Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar is hoping a recent surge in the state will help deliver a surprise showing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former VP Joe Biden, who both had disappointing results in Iowa, hope\u00a0New Hampshire voters put\u00a0the wind back in their campaign sails. The bottom line? Iowa didn't produce a clear front-runner, so New Hampshire may be the place to do it\u00a0(still,\u00a0Sanders leads a new national primary poll, followed by Biden and Michael Bloomberg, who's not on the New Hampshire ballot). Meanwhile, President Trump held a rally last night in New Hampshire, continuing to try to draw\u00a0attention away from the Democratic contest.\u00a0 2. Coronavirus\u00a0 The number of deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus has risen to more than 1,000, with all but two of those deaths in mainland China. The WHO has arrived in China to help control the epidemic and hopefully usher in a larger international team soon. Today also marks the end of the quarantine period for the first group of American evacuees from Wuhan, who have been staying at California's March Air Reserve Base since late January. No signs of the coronavirus were\u00a0detected among the group. Across the Pacific, another group of Americans isn't so lucky: 24 Americans are among the 135 people diagnosed with coronavirus aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, now quarantined in Japanese waters with more than 3,000 passengers.\u00a0 3. Budget cuts\u00a0 The White House has submitted a $4.8 trillion federal budget proposal for 2021, and some of the provisions are sure to invite controversy. The proposal would slash billions of dollars in federal support from Medicaid, food stamps and other safety net programs for the poor, while largely sparing the Medicare program that benefits seniors. It would also eliminate an existing student loan forgiveness program for\u00a0public workers, which provides\u00a0quite the contrast to\u00a0Democratic candidates who are touting sweeping student loan forgiveness programs on the campaign trail. NASA would get a $25 billion boost from Trump's\u00a0plan, with the aim of sending astronauts back to the moon by 2024.\u00a0All in all, despite calling for major cuts, the budget would fail to eliminate the national deficit over the next 10\u00a0years. While some of the budget provisions could pass the Democratic House, others, like the elimination of the student loan forgiveness plan, will have a much harder time getting through. 4. Germany\u00a0 Germany's political future is mired in uncertainty after longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel's hand-picked successor, Annegret\u00a0Kramp-Karrenbauer, unexpectedly announced that she will not run for chancellor in the 2021 general election. Merkel, who has led Germany for 15 years, is not planning to run for reelection. But\u00a0if\u00a0Kramp-Karrenbauer won't fill her shoes, that leaves the contest open for more right-leaning leaders (and their far-right allies) to step in and drastically change the direction of German\u00a0politics. This new destabilization probably means\u00a0Germany will be focusing on its own issues in the coming months, which is bad news for the European Union. Germany is a major power in the bloc, which is looking for strong leaders now that the UK has pulled out. 5. Nigeria At least 30 people, including a pregnant woman and a baby, were killed when\u00a0suspected Boko Haram militants set fire to a caravan of\u00a0sleeping travelers in Nigeria. The attackers burned 18 vehicles laden with food and other goods that were intended to be taken to a market the next day. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Boko Haram terrorist group has been waging war in the area for a decade,\u00a0burning down villages, attacking military checkpoints and kidnapping residents. This is the same region where 112 Chibok schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants in 2014.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's daughter is training to be the first fourth-generation WWE wrestler\u00a0 They grow up so fast!\u00a0 Don't trust your memories when you're high on weed, study says\u00a0 Science has now confirmed what common sense has been telling you all along.\u00a0 Black News Channel debuted this week\u00a0 It's the sole African American-led news network in the US (and it's rolling out during Black History Month).
