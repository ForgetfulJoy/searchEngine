Some have been forced to work from home or turn to the help of grandparents, and women are taking on a lot of the child care burden.\u00a0  \u201cIt is hard for families to balance work and life. School is the backbone of the country,\u201d says Gini Dupasquier, a consultant in Milan whose teenage daughters are now studying from home. The Italian education ministry launched a remote learning information portal and thousands of teachers have participated in related webinars -- but educators say that preparing video lessons, Google quizzes and video conferences have tripled their working days. ##Europe## Rain lashed down in Bethlehem on Friday but there were few people out on the streets anyway. Main roads were deserted, shops\u00a0and\u00a0restaurants were closed. The huge metal gate at Checkpoint 300, the main crossing point between Bethlehem\u00a0and\u00a0Jerusalem, was locked shut.\u00a0 Doors were closed at the Church of the Nativity, regarded as the birthplace of Jesus.\u00a0And\u00a0across Manger Square, the Omar Ben Khatab mosque stood empty as well; Friday prayers, the most important congregation of the week, canceled.\u00a0 Mohammad Al-Azzeh sat defiant outside his shop selling gifts for tourists, a teal-colored mask protecting his mouth.  \u201cI will try today,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if no one comes I will have to close for a month.\u201d Just around the corner, in the shadow of the huge wall erected by Israel to separate it from the Palestinian territories, the shutters were down at the \u201cWalled Off Hotel\u201d opened by the British graffiti artist Banksy; no guests today for the chimpanzee in the concierge\u2019s costume to welcome. A couple of miles away in the neighboring town of Beit Jala, there was security tape up in front of the Angel Hotel,\u00a0and\u00a0Palestinian police outside wearing face masks. This is the hotel at the center of the coronavirus scare, where seven workers tested positive yesterday, in an outbreak being linked to a Greek tour group that visited last week. Pastor Chris Bell from Fairhope, Alabama is among a group of 14 Americans who have found themselves caught up in the scare. He told CNN by phone that he\u00a0and\u00a0his group were two days into a tour of the Holy Land\u00a0and\u00a0had visited Bethlehem\u00a0and\u00a0Jerusalem before being told Wednesday evening that the hotel would likely be closed the following day as authorities looked into the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak.  The group was en route on to a new destination Thursday morning when they were told to turn the bus around\u00a0and\u00a0go back to the hotel. Bell paid tribute to the hotel staff. \u201cThey have been amazing, they have worked so hard to take care of us,\u201d he said, explaining that staff had cleaned out a whole floor for the group so that they could self-quarantine together. No one in the group was showing symptoms, Bell said, but there were frustrations that no one had come to the hotel yet to test them for coronavirus.  \u201cWe understand\u00a0that it is an overwhelming situation for the local authorities but we are not getting any information from them,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 One man who was out\u00a0and\u00a0about in the city was Jamil Azar, who was filling his car with gas. \u201cPeople are afraid as they don\u2019t know who has the virus\u00a0and\u00a0who does not,\u201d he said. Jamil himself was not overly concerned, though, believing that an age-old elixir, available to him as a Christian, would keep him right.  \u201cI don\u2019t wear a mask because I don\u2019t need it \u2026 I drink alcohol,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Andrew Carey contributed to this report. ##Middle East## A Lockheed Martin employee has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to a statement on the\u00a0company\u2019s website.\u00a0 According to the company, the employee was previously flagged for potential exposure\u00a0and they are deep cleaning work and common areas.

That includes the\u00a0North Carolina resident\u00a0who was isolated after testing presumptive positive this week and the Tennessee resident who tested positive after out-of-state travel and is also in home isolation. Residents in self-quarantine are people who may have come in contact with someone who was infected. Officials ask these individuals to stay at home for two weeks until it can be determined that they are not ill. For about 14 days, individuals under self-quarantine can't go to \"work, school or any other public places where they could have contact with others,\" according to Seattle & King County's department of public health in Washington state.

Asked if there should be more coordination in Europe,\u00a0he said:\u00a0\"Maybe, it\u2019s about risk assessment. The situation in each country is different and we have our public health authorities and they are responsible for that, and they assess the risks.\" Stella Kyriakides, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said it was \"a critical moment in terms of all our efforts to face the challenge of COVID-19\" and the commission would be \"looking at the preparedness of member states, their needs and looking at the need for solidarity at this moment.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Health Minister Simon Harris said: \u201cI think there does need to be a more common approach to a number of issues. It is important for citizens across European Union to hear the EU speak with one voice.\u201d ##Europe## From volunteers fumigating a Beijing compound to a helicopter dropping test kits onto a\u00a0cruise ship off the Californian coast, these are some of the latest dramatic photos emerging from the coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus was first reported in late December in\u00a0Wuhan,\u00a0a city of 11 million people in central China's Hubei province. As the virus spreads through Asia and the world, governments are racing to slow the rate of infection and containment efforts have been put in place in global tourist hubs. See how the world is battling this unprecedented epidemic here The director-general of the World Health Organization has warned governments that the continued international spread of the\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0is \"not a drill\" and will require significant action if public health authorities are to contain the deadly outbreak. The call to action comes as the\u00a0global number of people infected\u00a0by the virus nears 100,000 -- a grim milestone that now appears inevitable with self-sustaining clusters continuing to expand in South Korea, Japan, parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.\u00a0 WHO chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that although public health authorities across the globe have the ability to successfully combat the spread of the virus, the organization is concerned that in some countries the level of political commitment does not match the threat level.\u00a0 \"This is not a drill. This is not the time to give up. This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops. Countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans,\" Tedros said. \"This epidemic can be pushed back, but only with a collective, coordinated and comprehensive approach that engages the entire machinery of government.\" Read the full story here South Korea\u2019s Blue House revealed on Thursday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a letter to his counterpart in South Korea in which he conveyed a \u201cmessage of comfort\u201d to the South Korean people as they struggle with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. In his letter, Kim said he remains confident that South Korea will prevail in this fight and wished for the good health of the \u201cbrethren in the South.\u201d Kim also expressed that he was \u201cworried\u201d about South Korean President Moon Jae-in\u2019s health and expressed his \u201cunwavering friendship and trust\u201d towards President Moon. The exchange of personal letters comes at an interesting time for the two nations. Inter-Korean diplomacy has failed to yield major developments since Moon and Kim\u2019s first historic summit in 2018, and North Korea\u2019s rhetoric has gotten increasingly hostile toward the South. In fact, just days ago Kim Yo Jong -- Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister and the only member of the ruling family to visit South Korea -- likened Seoul to a \u201cfrightened dog barking\u201d for expressing worries over North Korea\u2019s short-range missile test on Monday. The Vatican City has reported its first case of the coronavirus. All outpatient services at the Vatican\u2019s health clinic were suspended on Friday \u201cin order to sanitize the environments following a positive case of COVID-19 found yesterday in one patient,\u201d Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in communique. \"The emergency room remains working.\" The Department of Health and Hygiene is in the process of informing Italian authorities, the statement added. ##Europe## Fourteen US tourists have been quarantined in a hotel in the West Bank town of Beit Jala, next to Bethlehem, Palestinian officials told CNN. The tour group had been staying at the Angel Hotel, which is at the center of a coronavirus outbreak after seven workers there tested positive on Thursday.\u00a0 The outbreak has been linked to a Greek tour group that stayed at the hotel last week, one of whose number tested positive for the virus when they returned home. The manager of the Angel Hotel, Mariana Al-Arja -- who is also under quarantine -- told CNN that the American tourists are in good spirits and have expressed their understanding of the situation, but have requested a US doctor visit the hotel to check up on them.\u00a0 Al-Arja added that the Americans have not yet been seen by a local doctor, nor tested for the virus. ##Middle East## Police in Indonesia seized over 60,000 masks and apprehended two people suspected of stockpiling the goods yesterday, in two separate raids in Jakarta. Officers have carried out several raids in the past few days on individuals who have \u201cattempted to gain financial benefits\u201d during the coronavirus outbreak, reported Indonesia\u2019s state news agency Antara. Yesterday, Indonesia\u2019s security minister Mohammad Mahfud\u00a0told journalists\u00a0police would enforce \u201ccriminal law against those engaged in panic buying,\u201d and that \u201cthe government classifies rush for and hoarding goods for the sake of profit-making into an act of economic subversion.\" ##Asia## All 126 new confirmed cases in Hubei province announced Friday were from the city of Wuhan, according to the Health Commission of Hubei Province.\u00a0 Seventeen new cases were announced outside the province on Friday by China\u2019s National Health Commission. ##Asia## Thousands of passengers and crew stuck aboard a cruise ship off the California coast\u00a0will discover their fate later today, when officials get results from\u00a0dozens of coronavirus tests. The California Air National Guard\u00a0dropped off test kits by helicopter\u00a0yesterday after learning that the first person to die of the virus in the state\u00a0previously traveled on the Grand Princess cruise liner. Medical officials collected samples for testing from 45 people aboard after some showed symptoms, which were flown to a lab in Richmond, the cruise line said. The ship must remain at sea\u00a0as it awaits test results,\u00a0which are expected today, said Mary Ellen Carroll of the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management. There are more than 3,500 people aboard the Grand Princess -- 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew members, Princess Cruises said. They represent 54 nationalities. The Grand Princess had gone on a trip from San Francisco to Mexico last month -- the California man who died was on this trip. Then the ship went on a 15-day trip from San Francisco to Hawaii, and was scheduled to return Saturday.

The tweet carried a memorandum from the ministry recommending individual state governments \"take necessary action\" to guide event organizers on precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. This comes right before a big festival: Holi is a major Hindu festival that falls on March 10 this year. Earlier this week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that he would not attend any Holi events this year in an effort to avoid public gatherings. And yesterday, the country's president also announced cancellations of traditional Holi gatherings at the presidential palace. The Mughal Gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's official residence, will also close for the public from Saturday to avoid any large gatherings. ##Asia## South Korea reported 309 more confirmed cases of the coronavirus today, bringing the national total to 6,593, according to the country\u2019s Central Disaster Relief Headquarters. As of today, around 70% of all cases nationwide are related to community spread, and over 60% of all cases are linked with a branch of the Shincheonji religious group in the southern city of Daegu. ##Asia## South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry expressed \u201cstrong regret\u201d today over travel restrictions Japan imposed yesterday. South Korea says it made repeated requests for Japan to review the situation before taking action, and had hoped Tokyo would have \u201csufficiently\u201d consulted Seoul before making the decision.\u00a0 South Korea raised the idea that an ulterior motive was behind Japan\u2019s decision as it says its efforts to contain the coronavirus have been recognized by the international community. South Korea\u2019s National Security Council also held a meeting Friday to consider taking corresponding measures against Japan and called into question Japan\u2019s efforts to contain the virus, saying Tokyo had taken \u201cunclear and passive measures.\u201d The measures in place: Under the new travel restrictions, travelers from South\u00a0Korea\u00a0and China will be quarantined for two weeks upon arrival in\u00a0Japan.  Incoming arrivals from those two countries will be asked to stay in designated places and to refrain from using public transportation. ##Asia## Taiwan has confirmed two more coronavirus cases, bringing the island's total to 44. One of the cases was \"imported\" -- a Taiwanese resident who returned from the Philippines on March 3, said Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control. The other case is a Taiwanese resident with no recent travel history, but who was in close contact with another infected patient. ##Asia## A New York rabbi, who teaches at Yeshiva University\u2019s Washington Heights campus in Manhattan, has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a\u00a0statement from the university.

Bodies are \"piling up\" in Iran: After a large number of deaths in the Middle Eastern country believed to be connected to the virus, delays in testing have caused bodies to pile up in morgues. People are also having to abandon traditional Islamic burial rites over fears it could spread the virus.  India is canceling some Holi gatherings over the virus:\u00a0The country's presidential palace has called off a traditional celebration of the Hindu festival, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is following advice to avoid public gatherings. At least 31 cases have been confirmed in the country. The South Korean religious group linked to that country's outbreak had a donation rejected:\u00a0Daegu, a city in the south of the East Asian country, refused a $10.1 million donation from the Shincheonji religious group, saying it should instead focus on being more transparent with the authorities and urging followers to get tested. The group has been linked to a major outbreak in the country which began in Daegu. US health officials are investigating the death of a former cruise passenger:\u00a0The man in his 70s died Thursday. He had previously been aboard a cruise ship with two passengers suspected of having the coronavirus. The news comes as testing began aboard the Grand Princess cruise liner off the coast of California. In neighboring Washington state, 13 people have died due to the virus.  CNN's global coronavirus town hall:\u00a0Health experts from across the US and CNN correspondents around the world joined a live audience to discuss the coronavirus and answer viewers' questions.\u00a0Click the \"Town Hall\" tab above to read those posts.  The coronavirus has had a dramatic effect on the global economy, with markets worldwide suffering losses. The Dow Jones closed down 970 points on Thursday, or 3.6%, marking its fifth-worst single-day point drop on record. The index was down nearly 1,148 points at its lowest point. This roller coaster of a week saw the Dow post two of its best days in history in terms of points gained on Monday and Wednesday, and one of its worst point losses Tuesday. The Fed shocked Wall Street Tuesday with an emergency rate cut to give businesses and households a boost, amid concerns that if coronavirus keeps people at home, consumer spending could fall. Travel and leisure companies are being hit hard. One executive in the aviation industry\u00a0called the virus a \"gut punch.\" \"This isn't economic in the sense that people want to travel but they can't afford to,\" said Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines. \"We could discount prices tomorrow and it wouldn't do any good.\" International carriers\u00a0are taking a similar hit The outbreak could cost the airline industry as much as $113 billion in lost revenue, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). While there were no predictions about how long the aviation world will be impacted, Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden said the \"booking softness\" is linked to substantial passenger \"anxiety\" -- a phenomenon the airline trade association in the US said may not be grounded in the actual risks to passengers. \"We're getting to the point where the reaction to the virus may be worse than the virus itself,\" said Nicholas Calio of Airlines for America.

Concerns are growing in Japan that the number of\u00a0coronavirus cases\u00a0could be higher than reported, with experts questioning the country's approach to testing as infection rates continue to climb. Japan has officially recorded 1,045 cases and 12 deaths from the virus, with 696 of those cases liked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined in Yokohama Bay last month. Although the Japanese government says it has the capacity to carry out 3,800 tests a day, only 8,111 tests had been conducted as of March 4,\u00a0according\u00a0to the country's Health Ministry. Numbers are likely higher: Japan's coronavirus figures are likely already much higher than reported, with the infection rate suspected to be just the \"tip of the iceberg,\" according to Masahiro Kami, the executive director of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, a non-profit group. Kami says for every one patient tested, there are many more who remain undiagnosed. But as most of these people are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms they don't go to a clinic to get checked out. Japan under pressure: The country has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak -- specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess. Critics have also accused Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of prioritizing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and bilateral ties over national security, particularly as Japan did not shut down its borders during the early stages of the outbreak.

Vietnam (16 cases) A strict ban on the consumption and farming of wild animals is being rolled out across China in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic, which is believed to have started at a wildlife market in the city of Wuhan. Although it is unclear which animal transferred the virus to humans -- bat, snake and pangolin have all been suggested --\u00a0China has acknowledged it needs to bring its lucrative wildlife industry under control if it is to prevent another outbreak. In late February, it slapped a temporary ban on all farming and consumption of \"terrestrial wildlife of important ecological, scientific and social value,\" which is expected to be signed into law later this year. But ending the trade will be hard: The cultural roots of China's use of wild animals run deep, not just for food but also for traditional medicine, clothing, ornaments and even pets. This\u00a0isn't the first time Chinese officials have tried to contain the trade. In 2003, civets -- mongoose-type creatures -- were\u00a0banned and culled in large numbers\u00a0after it was discovered they likely transferred the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus to humans. The selling of snakes was also\u00a0briefly\u00a0banned in Guangzhou\u00a0after the SARS outbreak. But today dishes using the animals are still eaten in parts of China. Public health experts say the ban is an important first step, but are calling on Beijing to seize this crucial opportunity to close loopholes -- such as the use of wild animals in traditional Chinese medicine -- and begin to change cultural attitudes in China around consuming wildlife.

The employee, a Korean citizen, is currently in isolation at her off-base residence in the city of Cheonan, as directed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a USFK news release..\u00a0 KCDC and USFK health professionals are now conducting contact tracing to determine whether anyone else may have been exposed.\u00a0 USFK remains at a \"high\" risk level and is implementing control measures to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, said the release. Military warns of more virus to come: This comes as a research director for the US military warns that there may be a \"second wave\" of the virus next winter, if the world can't contain the crisis by then, as viruses spread more easily in cold weather. ##Asia## ##United States## Another suspected coronavirus patient in India tested positive today, raising the national total to 31 confirmed cases. The patient has a travel history to Thailand and Malaysia, and is in a stable condition under quarantine in hospital, Indian officials said today. All international arrivals to India are required to undergo medical screening, irrespective of nationality, officials said. These screening measures are in place across 30 airports. ##Asia## China has vowed to continue providing medical assistance to Iran to help curb the coronavirus outbreak, said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian during a daily briefing. China has also dispatched an expert medical team to the country, he said.\u00a0 The expert team, sent by the Red Cross Society of China, has been working \u201cdiligently\u201d with Iranian health officials and WHO experts since February 29, said Zhao.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to do whatever we can to help them,\u201d Zhao said, adding that \u201cthe Iranian government and people are at a crucial juncture in their fight against the epidemic.\u201d China decries sanctions: Zhao also criticized continuing unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying they \u201cwill only make things worse, which is inhumane.\u201d \u201cWe urge the relevant side to immediately lift such sanctions on Iran and stop getting in the way of Iran's and the global efforts against the epidemic,\u201d he said. ##Asia## ##Middle East## Google is giving California employees in the Bay Area the option to work from home, if roles allow, to test their business continuity processes, a spokesperson for the tech giant said today. Other major companies in virus-hit areas of the US are also starting to implement these measures. Amazon\u00a0has recommended Washington state employees in\u00a0Seattle\u00a0and Bellevue work from home if they are able to until the end of the month. California and Washington are the worst affected states by the virus in the US. A total of 49 cases and one death have been recorded in California, with at least 70 cases and 13 fatalities in Washington, according to CNN's tally of cases detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems. This includes presumptive positive cases that tested positive in a public health lab and are pending confirmation from the US Centers for Disease Control, and confirmed cases that have received positive results from the CDC. ##United States## The death toll from the coronavirus in Washington state has risen to at least 13, according to new reporting from a hospital system based in the virus-hit city of Kirkland. Jeff Tomlin, CEO of healthcare system EvergreenHealth, told CNN that 11 patients at his facility have died after testing positive for coronavirus. CNN previously reported 11 deaths in total, including a woman in her 80s who died at home and a man in his 50s who died at the Harborview Medical Center.\u00a0 That means at least 13 people have died statewide. CNN has attempted to verify the number of deaths with the Washington Department of Health, but Tomlin says there is often a lag time in their numbers getting included in the state\u2019s total number of fatalities. There are now 228 cases of coronavirus in the US and 14 deaths, according to CNN's tally. ##United States## A political storm has erupted over confusion and shortfalls in United States\u00a0federal coronavirus testing that are thwarting a true accounting of the disease's advance and exposing President Donald Trump's misleading claims of seamless White House crisis management. On Thursday, new problems emerged in the administration's effort to rush testing kits to health care providers, while state and local political leaders expressed growing frustration about the situation in their constituencies. There aren't enough tests: Vice President Mike Pence bluntly replied to questions about the availability of testing kits, admitting to reporters that \"we don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.\" While he did say the government currently can test \"those that we believe have been exposed, for those who are showing symptoms,\" his remarks raised questions about his\u00a0previous promise that \"any American can be tested.\" The vice president's comment reflected the candor he has shown in\u00a0leading the coronavirus task force, which is unusual for this administration and has won him plaudits among some Democrats on Capitol Hill. Some officials and health care providers are warning that the lack of testing capacity is not just a future problem, it also is hampering attempts to get a fix on the disease right now. Read the full analysis here: ##United States## India has confirmed a total of 30 coronavirus cases, the country's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said yesterday.\u00a0 Two cases have a travel history to Italy, and one has a travel history to Iran. Six cases in Agra, in India's northwestern state of Rajasthan, are all contacts of the first case reported in New Delhi with travel history to Italy. One case from Telangana has a travel history to Dubai, along with contacts in Singapore. There are also 16 Italians confirmed with the virus, who tested positive earlier this week. They are part of a larger group of 22 Italian tourists who came to\u00a0India\u00a0on February 21. The tourists' driver, an\u00a0Indian citizen, has also been infected with the disease. Three reported cases in\u00a0the southern state of Kerala have recovered and been discharged, the ministry said. ##Asia## Viruses spread more easily in cold weather than hot, which is why winter is peak influenza season.  While it has yet to be seen whether the coronavirus will recede as temperatures increase in the northern hemisphere (and cases in tropical Singapore and southern hemisphere Australia may suggest the virus isn't too sensitive to hot weather), some researchers have warned it could become a perennial winter threat.  Speaking at a Pentagon briefing Thursday, Nelson Michael, the director for infectious disease research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, said that efforts to develop vaccines and an effective treatment plan might not be quick enough to wipe out the virus before the \"second wave\" next winter.  \"This is a respiratory virus and they always give us trouble during cold weather, for obvious reasons. We\u2019re all inside, the windows are closed, etcetera, so we typically call that the influenza or the flu season,\" Nelson said. He predicted the coronavirus may behave like the flu and give us \"less trouble as the weather warms up,\" but, he cautioned, it tends to come back when the weather gets cold again. \"This is why it\u2019s really important to understand that a lot of what we\u2019re doing now is getting ourselves ready for what we\u2019re calling the second wave of this,\" Nelson warned. \"We hope it doesn\u2019t happen. If you remember SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), SARS came and went very quickly. We can\u2019t count on that. We have to be ready that even if this epidemic begins to wane, we have to be ready for next winter when it may come back again.\" ##United States## Footage from inside Qom's Behesht-e Masoumeh morgue in Iran shows dozens of bodies sheathed in black bags lining the floor, while workers in protective suits and masks busily walk among them. It's unclear which, if any, of the people whose bodies lie in the morgue were infected with the coronavirus gripping the Middle Eastern country.  And herein lies a huge problem for Iran, one of the worst-hit countries outside China. Medical precautions clash with tradition: Under Islamic tradition in Iran, corpses are typically washed with soap and water before burial. But two medical workers in Qom told CNN that in some cases precautions related to the outbreak are preventing staff from observing traditional Islamic guidelines for burial. Instead, patients' bodies are being treated with calcium oxide to prevent them from contaminating the soil once buried in cemeteries, they said. Bodies are piling up: Testing for the virus takes time, delaying burials and creating a \"pile up\" of bodies at the morgue, said Behesht-e Masoumeh morgue director, Ali Ramezani, in a report on Iranian state TV, IRIB. Read the full story here. ##Middle East## The director-general of the World Health Organization has warned governments that the coronavirus' continued global spread is \"not a drill,\" and will require significant action if public health authorities are to contain the deadly outbreak. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday that although public health authorities across the globe have the ability to successfully combat the spread of the virus, the organization is concerned that in some countries, the level of political commitment does not match the threat level. \"This is not a drill. This is not the time to give up. This is not a time for excuses. This is a time for pulling out all the stops. Countries have been planning for scenarios like this for decades. Now is the time to act on those plans,\" Tedros said. \n\"This epidemic can be pushed back, but only with a collective, coordinated and comprehensive approach that engages the entire machinery of government.\" Cases approach 100,000: To date, a total of 97,852 infections have been confirmed worldwide, and more than 3,300 people have been killed by the virus, according to CNN's tally. This number of total cases worldwide is fast approaching 100,000 -- a grim milestone that now appears inevitable with self-sustaining clusters continuing to expand in South Korea, Japan, parts of Europe, Iran and the United States. Read the full story here. Test results taken from 45 people aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship are expected Friday, the ship\u2019s operator Princess Cruises said in a statement on Thursday night. The samples, collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local authorities, are from both passengers and crew members. They were delivered to the state\u2019s public health department lab in Richmond, according to the statement. \"Princess Cruises can confirm there are 3,533 people currently onboard Grand Princess, including 2,422 guests and 1,111 teammates. In total, they represent 54 nationalities,\" Princess Cruises said. All guests on the ship have been asked to stay in their rooms while test results are pending. Guests are receiving meal deliveries by room service, they added. Princess Cruises is the operator of the Diamond Princess, another cruise liner which was quarantined for weeks in Japan last month.  Hundreds of people onboard that ship tested positive for the virus. A top Japanese government adviser admitted in February that the quarantine measures enacted may have allowed additional infections to spread among the ship's crew and passengers. India is canceling some Holi gatherings over the virus: The country's presidential palace has called off a traditional celebration of the Hindu festival, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is following advice to avoid public gatherings.  The South Korean religious group linked to that country's outbreak had a donation rejected: Daegu, a city in the south of the East Asian country, refused a $10.1 million donation from the Shincheonji religious group, saying it should instead focus on being more transparent with the authorities and urging followers to get tested. The group has been linked to a major outbreak in the country which began in Daegu.  US health officials are investigating the death of a former cruise passenger: The man in his 70s died Thursday. He had previously been aboard a cruise ship with two passengers suspected of having the novel coronavirus. The news comes as testing began aboard the Grand Princess cruise liner off the coast of California.  Stock markets took another tumble:\u00a0US stocks finished sharply lower on Thursday, with all three major indexes closing down more than 3%. Markets were already suffering globally due to concerns of the knock-on effect coronavirus quarantines and closures could have on the global economy. The latest numbers:\u00a0The\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0has\u00a0killed at least 3,383\u00a0people, according to CNN's tally -- the vast majority in mainland China. There are\u00a0now more than\u00a097,850\u00a0global cases,\u00a0with infections in at least 85 countries and territories. More than 17,300 cases have been confirmed outside of mainland China. CNN's global coronavirus town hall: Health experts from across the US and CNN correspondents around the world joined each other and a live audience to discuss the coronavirus and answer viewers' questions. Scroll through the posts below to catch up. CNN's town hall on the coronavirus has now concluded.  CNN international correspondents and medical experts answered questions from the audience and gave live reports from London, Shanghai and Milan. Scroll through our posts to catch up on what happened during CNN's global coronavirus town hall. Keep following our live coverage here. ##Town Hall## Another audience member at CNN's town hall asked why the US hasn't implemented aggressive testing measures like South Korea has. South Korea has drive-through testing sites: CNN correspondent Ivan Watson visited one of these sites, where people can get tested in a matter of minutes without ever leaving their car. \"The mayor of the city that\u00a0implemented that said he was\u00a0inspired by Starbucks and\u00a0McDonald's drive-throughs,\" Watson said. \"The\u00a0doctors that we talked to said\u00a0this really speeds up the\u00a0process of testing people and\u00a0also protects the doctors and\u00a0the nurses from more contact\u00a0with potential carriers because\u00a0the patients never get out of\u00a0the cars.\" It's hugely efficient: That one drive-through test site can process more than 300 people a day, Watson said. Seoul, the national capital, now has at\u00a0least three of these drive-through\u00a0testing centers. \"More than 150,000 people have\u00a0been tested here,\" Watson said.\u00a0\"I think this is an example of\u00a0how amid this public health\u00a0crisis, people are coming up\u00a0with ideas.\u00a0They are adapting.\" The US is lagging behind in testing: Only about 1,500 tests have been run in the US, compared to thousands a day in South Korea, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. There are a few reasons for the delay \u2014 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched its roll out of testing, and some in the medical field have complained about strict rules on who is allowed testing. In many places, only those presenting severe symptoms are encouraged to get tested, even though there may be many more asymptomatic patients. ##Town Hall## India's Presidential palace, the Rashtrapati Bhavan, will not be holding traditional Holi gatherings this year, the country's president said on Twitter.  Indian President Ram Nath Kovind said the decision has been taken as a \"precautionary measure\" amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he will be skipping a key event to mark the festival of Holi this year in a bid to avoid public gatherings as the novel coronavirus cases rise in India. Holi is a popular Hindu festival that signifies the arrival of spring and the end of winter. There have been epidemics in decades past, and there will be more in future years. But what an epidemic looks like will continue shifting as we move into a hyperconnected globalized world, said Dr. Nathan Wolfe, virologist and infectious diseases expert, at a CNN town hall. The world is more connected: \"We talked about\u00a0the 1918 pandemic, how many\u00a0flights were there in 1918?\u00a0Zero.\u00a0How many flights do we\u00a0anticipate in 2020?\u00a040 million flights.\u00a0The nature of our world and the\u00a0connectivity of our world has\u00a0changed so dramatically we're\u00a0going to continue to see these\u00a0outbreaks again and again,\" Wolfe said. We will keep seeing these epidemics, he warned: \"For many people, they may feel\u00a0what we're experiencing is a\u00a0groundhog day, and it's certainly\u00a0the case these epidemics are\u00a0going to continue into the\u00a0future.\" But we've also come a long way: \"A lot has happened since 10,\u00a012 years ago, when we were doing\u00a0this.\u00a0There's been a tremendous\u00a0investment,\" Wolfe said. \"Now the US Government invests\u00a0something on the order of $12\u00a0billion a year for health\u00a0security.\u00a0It needs to be sustained, it's\u00a0not enough \u2014 but what we weren't\u00a0doing then, we do now.\" ##Town Hall## The advice on whether people should wear masks differs from country to country, depending on the severity of the situation in each place and what local health authorities are advising. In Hong Kong, for instance, city authorities are advising people wear masks in crowded places like public transport. But in the US, officials are advising the opposite. \"For someone who's healthy, it's\u00a0not going to protect you against\u00a0the virus,\" said CNN Chief Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. \"It may actually become a\u00a0reservoir when you're taking it\u00a0on, when you're taking it off.\u00a0You could actually contaminate\u00a0yourself.\u00a0It traps viral particles.\u00a0It doesn't do what people think\u00a0it would do.\" Here's who should be wearing masks: People who are actually sick. The masks, Gupta said, \"may decrease the\u00a0amount of respiratory droplets\u00a0coming out of their mouth or\u00a0nose.\" Health care workers who are taking\u00a0care of very sick patients also need masks \u2014 another reason why people shouldn't panic and buy masks, he said. It could cut the supply for these nurses and doctors on the front line against the virus. ##United States## ##Asia## One audience member at CNN's coronavirus town hall asked a crucial question that will undoubtedly be a major concern for many Americans: \"If I have been exposed to\u00a0COVID-19 and I do not have\u00a0insurance, who will pay for the\u00a0treatment and recovery involved?\" Here's what CNN correspondents and medical experts have to say: First off, the American healthcare system is broken. \"Twenty-seven million Americans are\u00a0uninsured, many more are\u00a0underinsured, and we have so much\u00a0data already that that delays\u00a0people getting the treatment\u00a0that they need. At the best of\u00a0times, that's not good.\u00a0But during an epidemic, that's\u00a0terrible,\" said Dr. Seema Yasmin, a former detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The testing is covered \u2014 but hospitalization is not. \"(Testing) is considered an essential\u00a0health benefit now,\" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. \"As far as we know we're\u00a0hearing it's covered by Medicare\u00a0and Medicaid, and state and\u00a0local public health labs. So that part will be covered.\"\n\"But\u00a0I think your question is about\u00a0the hospitalization \u2014 everything\u00a0that would be associated with\u00a0that.\u00a0There's no guarantees about\u00a0that being covered.\" ##Town Hall## Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist with the World Health Organization, called the coronavirus \"a controllable virus\" tonight at CNN's town hall. Van Kerkhove spent two weeks in China working with Chinese health authorities to better understand what worked to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cFundamental public health actions\u201d worked, she said.  Washing hands, social distancing, people staying home when they are sick, seeking treatment when necessary and tracing the contacts of the people who have tested positive for the virus are all ways to limit the spread of the disease, Van Kerkhove said. \u201cThose lessons can be applied to all countries,\u201d Van Kerkhove said.\u00a0\u201cWe are seeing countries demonstrate that they can slow this virus down.\u201d ##Town Hall## The Kirkland, Washington, nursing home experiencing a deadly outbreak of the novel coronavirus had several issues noted in an inspection report last year, including \"severe deficiencies\" related to infection control, according to Seema Verma, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services. The April 2019 inspection report for Life Care Center says that the facility \"failed to consistently implement an effective infection control program\" and \"failed to ensure staff had knowledge and follow transmission-based precautions as required for one of two residents reviewed for infection control and transmission-based precautions.\" The level of harm was listed as \"minimal harm or potential for actual harm,\" but the number of residents affected was listed as \"many,\" the report stated. More details: The report points out improper storage of respiratory supplies, as well as a problem with a nonfunctioning ventilation system in the laundry facility.  Other problems with infection control included a staffer that did not wear a mask, gown or gloves when entering an isolation room where such precautions were required; the inaccurate application of a bandage for a pressure wound while the patient was resting her injured foot on the floor; and a kitchen worker that didn\u2019t remove dirty gloves before putting away clean dishes. A review of the center\u2019s infection control report showed two outbreaks of influenza that affected at least 17 residents \u2013 eight confirmed cases and nine residents with respiratory symptoms \u2013 and seven staff members or caregivers, the report said. The facility was fined around $67,000 over the deficiencies, Verma said in a call with reporters. When inspectors returned for an unannounced visit in June 2019, they found it had corrected the issues and was compliant with Medicare safety requirements.  CNN reached out to the Life Care Center about the past inspections but did not hear back about the issue. Inspections are underway with regard to the coronavirus outbreak.  ##United States## The coronavirus outbreak has not just sparked fear and anxiety in countries like the US and UK \u2014 it has also seen a rise in xenophobic and racist assaults against people of East Asian and Chinese descent. Adam Whalen, a biostatistics and epidemiology major, joined CNN's town hall to ask:  \" COVID-19 is not only a\u00a0biological disease, it's a\u00a0social one ... How do we separate the\u00a0biological facts of this\u00a0disease from the racist views that\u00a0members of this community face?\" CNN correspondent David Culver, based in China, responds: \"What the government\u00a0here has been doing, through\u00a0certain propaganda outlets as\u00a0well, has been trying to diffuse\u00a0this and and by trying to stress that everyone\u00a0is going through this together, that\u00a0this is a collective effort to\u00a0try to push past,\" he said.\n\"But also,\u00a0they're issuing policy and doing\u00a0so against western countries\u00a0like the US. The Chinese government, for\u00a0example, has advised their\u00a0citizens not to go to the US, they're saying do not travel\u00a0there because you will\u00a0potentially be treated unfairly\u00a0in the midst of all of this.\" ##Town Hall## Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, whose World Central Kitchen fed those aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, spoke at CNN's ongoing town hall about what it was like on board. \"If you are in a place, a\u00a0hotel, a cruise ship, where\u00a0everybody may be infected,\u00a0it's logical to say that you want to\u00a0make sure in this case food is\u00a0prepared outside,\" Andr\u00e9s said. Here's how they got it done: First, they cooked meals outside the ship in an onshore location. \"We got a\u00a0lot of help from different\u00a0Japanese chefs,\" Andr\u00e9s said.\u00a0Then, they brought the food to kitchens near the ship. \"We\u00a0will reheat the food and put it\u00a0back and bring it in with a\u00a0forklift.\u00a0And then inside, they will\u00a0take care of distribution,\" he said.  \"Everything was done, I would\u00a0say, in a very professional way\u00a0to make sure that everybody will\u00a0be safe, achieving what we\u00a0wanted, feed everybody in a\u00a0healthy way,\" Andr\u00e9s added. This isn't the first time Andr\u00e9s has cooked in disaster scenarios: He also helped cook meals for those affected in the Bahamas during Hurricane Dorian, as well as Americans after as\u00a0Hurricane Maria,\u00a0Hurricane Florence, and the\u00a0California wildfires. ##Town Hall## One audience member at CNN's town hall asked: now that the virus has gone global, having reached every continent, except Antarctica, are travel restrictions still effective? CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman weighed in from Milan, Italy, where towns and cities have been placed under lockdown in the country's northern Lombardy region. Italy under lockdown: The police and army have set up roadblocks in \"Red Zones,\" and are checking everyone going in or out, Wedeman said. Most residents in the area aren't allowed to leave at all.  \"The whole idea is to prevent the\u00a0spread of the coronavirus\u00a0because that's where the\u00a0outbreak was first concentrated,\" he said. \"What we've seen in this part of\u00a0Italy is that despite these\u00a0containment areas, these Red\u00a0Zones, the virus has spread to\u00a0other areas, so the government\u00a0is considering creating new Red\u00a0Zones.\" \"Now, the Red Zones that were set\u00a0up are due to, at least in\u00a0theory, they should come to an\u00a0end this coming Sunday.\u00a0There's a question of whether\u00a0they will be extended.\u00a0And therefore there's a big\u00a0debate here in Italy whether\u00a0they have been effective at all\u00a0because the numbers, frankly,\u00a0continue to rise.\" Numbers are spiking despite the lockdown: When Wedeman arrived in Italy 10 days ago, there were 322 infected cases nationwide. Now, the number has reached 3,858.\u00a0 ##Town Hall## CNN's coronavirus town hall is now answering questions from the audience and from our viewers at home.  Here are a few of their questions answered: Does the\u00a0coronavirus change or mutate?\u00a0Could it affect a person more\u00a0than once? \"This coronavirus\u00a0likely jumped from animals to\u00a0humans.\u00a0In order for that to do that it\u00a0mutated at some point,\" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. \"As it spreads through humans it\u00a0continues to mutate somewhat.\u00a0We know, for example, this\u00a0patient in Washington, the first\u00a0patient diagnosed in this\u00a0country, they looked at the\u00a0genome and they tried to match\u00a0it to subs subsequent\u00a0infections, and there was a lot\u00a0of similarities, but the virus\u00a0continues to mutate.\" As for the repeat infection \u2014 we don't know yet for sure. There have been reports of people being infected more than once, but it's unclear whether this is a testing issue. An elementary school teacher asked: What should teachers be doing in their classrooms to\u00a0protect themselves and their students? The virus doesn't appear to be affecting children as heavily. In China, the hardest-hit country, less than 1% of cases were children.  But preventative measures can include wiping down surfaces and disinfecting commonly touched objects, as the virus can survive on surfaces. ##Town Hall## The Houston Health Department announced Thursday the first presumptive positive case of coronavirus in the city of Houston.  According a news release from the city, the case is a man aged between 60 and 70, with a history of international travel. The man is experiencing mild symptoms and is in self-quarantine at home. He is part of a group of travelers to Egypt. There is no evidence of community spread. Earlier on Thursday, officials in Harris County linked the three previous confirmed Texas cases to a group that traveled to Egypt. ##United States## Coronavirus screening got off to \u201ca slow start\" and there were some \u201cmissteps\u201d with regard to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s test, but the problems have been addressed, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at CNN\u2019s town hall tonight.  By the end of the week or the beginning of next week, the CDC should be able to get out about 75,000 additional tests. Partnering with the private sector will help get out millions more, Fauci said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see in the reasonable future is a dramatic escalation in the number of tests that are going to be available,\u201d Fauci said. By the following week, \u201cthey could get up to a million tests out there \u2013 that\u2019s the plan, that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing.\u201d To get a fuller picture of the coronavirus, the US needs testing that is \u201cmuch more proactive,\u201d not just when doctors ask for it, Fauci said. This will help determine how much the disease has spread and how many cases are going undetected.\u00a0 \u201cFor that reason, we\u2019re going to need millions and millions and millions of tests,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I feel and that\u2019s what many of my colleagues feel.\u201d Watch: ##Town Hall## Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious diseases epidemiologist with the World Health Organization, has weighed in to offer advice to the public at CNN's coronavirus town hall. \"Our biggest advice right now is\u00a0to be ready.\u00a0We want everyone to know what\u00a0they can do to protect\u00a0themselves, to protect their\u00a0families at an individual level,\" she said. \"I want to emphasize for our\u00a0viewers, we can look to doctors\u00a0and government officials, but it\u00a0is each of us, individuals all\u00a0around the world, who are\u00a0literally the front lines of\u00a0this,\" she added.\u00a0\"It's washing your hands, not\u00a0just for yourself, it's for your\u00a0fellow family members and fell\u00a0low citizens.\u00a0Each of us have a responsibility\u00a0in this.\" What she said people should be doing: Wash your hands: A basic measure that goes a long way when done properly with soap and water for 20 seconds, and frequently throughout the day.\nIf you don't have access to that: Use alcohol gel or hand sanitizer.\nRespiratory etiquette:\u00a0Sneeze or cough into your elbow or a\u00a0tissue, and put it in a bin.\nBe informed: Use reliable sources like the WHO or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Educate\u00a0yourself, know what you can do,\u00a0how you can protect yourself,\u00a0how you can protect your family,\" Kerkhove said. ##Town Hall## The government of the South Korean city of Daegu has rejected a $10.1 million donation from the Shincheonji religious group at the center of the coronavirus outbreak in the East Asian country. \"What we need is not the financial donation but full cooperation for the government\u2019s quarantine measures from Lee Man-hee, the leader of Shincheonji group, and all of his followers,\" Daegu city Mayor Kwon Young-jin said Friday. Pressure has been growing on the group amid claims -- which it denies -- that Shincheonji has not been fully cooperating with officials and concealing the names of followers who might have been exposed to the coronavirus.  According to the Daegu government, there are numerous followers who tested positive for the virus but have refused to be admitted to community treatment centers. Officials also accused others of hampering quarantine measures.  ##Asia## Joining us at the town hall is Dr. Mark Rupp, Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). UNMC is currently running a clinical\u00a0trial\u00a0of\u00a0an experimental coronavirus treatment, and have a second participant enrolled in the\u00a0trial.\u00a0The\u00a0trial\u00a0is sponsored by the National Institute\u00a0of\u00a0Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part\u00a0of\u00a0the National Institutes\u00a0of\u00a0Health (NIH). \"We're very pleased with the\u00a0fact that we brought this trial\u00a0on extremely quickly along with\u00a0our colleagues at the NIH,\" said Rupp. \"It shows great promise.\u00a0This was a drug that was\u00a0developed and tested initially\u00a0against Ebola virus.\u00a0It was found to not be very effective\u00a0against Ebola but did seem to\u00a0work against some of these coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. So it really does seem to show\u00a0some promise now with the\u00a0treatment of Covid-19.\u00a0So we're very hopeful, but it's\u00a0way too early to say anything.\" He urged the public not to panic: \"I do agree we need to take a\u00a0collective deep breath and\u00a0realize this is not some\u00a0existential threat against\u00a0mankind.\u00a0A quarter to a third of us are\u00a0not going to die in the next\u00a0year, like in Europe in the Middle Ages,\" Rupp said. But we should still be cautious: \"This is a very\u00a0serious event and one that we need to take seriously and prepare for and\u00a0do everything we can to blunt\u00a0the spread of this pandemic,\" he added, warning that a worst case scenario could lead to \"Millions of potential\u00a0infections, resulting in\u00a0hundreds of thousands of deaths.\" ##Town Hall## A Nebraska man who traveled on a cruise ship that was overcome with coronavirus explained what it felt like to contract the virus tonight during CNN's town hall. Carl Goldman contracted the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. One of the first signs of the illness was a high fever, Goldman said. \"Yeah, the common denominator\u00a0seems to be a spiked, very high\u00a0fever in a quick amount of time.\u00a0We had been sent back from the\u00a0Diamond Princess over to the\u00a0states on a 747 cargo plane.\u00a0When I got on the plane, I fell\u00a0asleep.\u00a0I was still feeling fine when we\u00a0got on the plane.\u00a0Fell asleep next to my wife.\u00a0Two hours later, I woke up and I\u00a0had a high fever, 103 plus,\" Goldman said. When Goldman went to a doctor aboard the ship, the doctor told the Omaha native that he had to be placed in a quarantine area. \"He tested me and saw that I did\u00a0have the fever.\u00a0Was put in a quarantine area.\u00a0Flown here to Omaha, and put in\u00a0the biocontainment center where\u00a0I was, again, tested for the\u00a0actual virus.\u00a0And it came out positive. But it felt less than a common\u00a0cold.\u00a0I didn't have a stuffy nose.\u00a0Didn't have a sore throat.\u00a0The fever was high, but no body\u00a0aches, no chills, no sweating\u00a0that usually comes with 103\u00a0fever,\" Goldman said. More on the Diamond Princess: The American-owned cruise ship was put under quarantine by Japanese for two weeks in February after a coronavirus outbreak was detected on board. At least 705 people contracted the virus during the quarantine, four of whom have died. For a time, the ship had the largest concentration of cases outside of mainland China, where the virus is thought to have originated. Watch:  ##Town Hall## Health officials in California are investigating the death of a 72-year-old Bay Area man who was previously on a cruise ship with two passengers suspected of having the coronavirus.  The man, who has not been identified, died Thursday after officers were called to his home, where they found him \"unconscious and not breathing\" and were unable to resuscitate.  While obtaining medical history on the patient, a family member advised officers that the man had recently been aboard a cruise ship with two passengers suspected of having the novel coronavirus, said Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety Chief Phan S. Ngo Ngo was not able to confirm which cruise ship the patient was on and said they have not yet determined if the patient had coronavirus. Autopsy results are pending and the Santa Clara County Public Health Department is investigating the case. Seven public safety officers who responded to the call were placed into a brief quarantine \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Ngo said. They have since been sent home, but have not been tested as they are not showing symptoms of the virus.  Sunnyvale is in Northern California\u2019s Santa Clara County, which currently has 20 confirmed cases.  ##United States## CNN's town hall on the coronavirus, addressing facts, fears, and medical guidance, is about halfway through -- it will run until midnight ET. We're covering the town hall here with live updates -- but you can also send in questions and stream it live. How do I participate? The experts will take questions from the studio audience and from viewers around the world.\u00a0Submit them here\u00a0or tweet them using the hashtag #CNNTownHall. Where can I watch it? The town hall will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, across mobile devices via CNN's apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795 and the Westwood One Radio Network. ##Town Hall## CNN's town hall is now turning to the question of what an epidemic would look like in the United States. A moderate scenario might be a million hospitalizations \u2014 meaning 200,000 people would need to be in the\u00a0intensive care unit, and 64,000\u00a0people would need breathing\u00a0machines, said CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. The question: \"We don't have all that.\u00a0We have maybe just barely that.\u00a0And many of those ventilators\u00a0and breathing machines are\u00a0currently being used.\u00a0What are we going to do if that\u00a0many people actually need care\u00a0like that?\" Gupta said. The answer: \"It's one area where the\u00a0response has been laggard,\" responded Ron Klein,\u00a0President Barack Obama's Ebola response coordinator. \"Getting our health care system\u00a0ready for the influx of cases is\u00a0something we should be doing\u00a0now.\u00a0We saw in China they built\u00a0temporary hospitals.\u00a0They really flexed up their capacity,\" he said. Klein went on to make this crucial point:  \"It's not just the people who get\u00a0coronavirus are going to be\u00a0affected by this.\u00a0If hospital emergency rooms are\u00a0overwhelmed, if doctors and\u00a0nurses treating those people get\u00a0sick and staffing drops at our\u00a0hospitals, if we don't have\u00a0enough beds, people with other\u00a0illnesses won't be able to get\u00a0into the hospital and get\u00a0treatment.\u00a0People with routine medical\u00a0conditions won't be able to get\u00a0treatment.\u00a0The possible impact on our\u00a0health care system is something\u00a0we should be using this time, as\u00a0cases ramp up, to get ready for.\" Watch:  ##Town Hall## CNN Correspondent Will Ripley is joining the town hall to bring us the latest on the situation in Japan -- where a debate is ongoing on the future of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. \"This has not\u00a0been a great week for organizers\u00a0of Tokyo 2020 and the International Olympic Committee\u00a0because Japan saw the case\u00a0numbers rise over 1,000,\" said Ripley. \"You have infectious diseases\u00a0experts saying that the number could be 10 times the official report\u00a0because of the fact this\u00a0country's testing so few people.\" Will the Games be canceled? Not yet -- despite calls to do so. \"You have Olympics organizers\u00a0saying that they're still proceeding as if they're going to\u00a0deliver the games on schedule at the end of\u00a0July. But a growing number of people\u00a0are questioning whether it's going\u00a0to be safe to do that, given that you\u00a0have people from 200-plus\u00a0countries scheduled to come from\u00a0all over the world, living in\u00a0close quarters for a period of weeks then going back\u00a0to their countries,\" Ripley said. The question of a pandemic: \"The big concern is if this outbreak\u00a0continues to intensify, if it\u00a0becomes a pandemic by summer,\u00a0will they be able to hold the\u00a0Games? Right now, there isn't an answer to that\u00a0question.\" Watch:  ##Town Hall## The northeastern US state of Maryland has joined California and Washington in declaring an emergency over the coronavirus, after the first cases were confirmed there Thursday.  \"In order to further mobilize all available state resources in response to this threat to public health, I have issued a proclamation declaring a state of emergency in Maryland,\" Governor Larry Hogan said in a statement. \"With this declaration, I am officially authorizing and directing the Maryland Department of Health and the Maryland Emergency Management Agency to ramp up coordination among all state and local agencies and enable them to fast-track coordination with our state and local health departments and emergency management teams.\" Three positive cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in Montgomery County on Thursday. The county is Maryland's most populous, and borders Washington, DC. The patients, who contracted the virus while traveling overseas, are in good condition and are in quarantine at their homes, the state government said.  \"While today\u2019s news may seem overwhelming, this is not a reason to panic,\" Hogan said. \"Marylanders should go to work or go to school tomorrow just as they normally would. At the same time, I want to continue to remind everyone to prepare themselves and continue to stay informed. I am confident in our state\u2019s ability to respond effectively to these three cases of coronavirus as well as to any future cases, and to be a national leader in responding to this situation and in developing treatments and perhaps even a vaccine.\" ##United States## More testing is needed to determine what the fatality rate may be in the US from the coronavirus, according to Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci's answer was prompted by a question from CNN's Anderson Cooper tonight during its global town hall tonight. \"There is a segment of the\u00a0group \u2014 we don't know how large\u00a0it is \u2014 who are without\u00a0symptoms and are not getting\u00a0counted in the calculation.\u00a0And that's why the point you\u00a0make is very valid.\u00a0Until we have a much more\u00a0accurate determination of who is\u00a0infected, including those who\u00a0are asymptomatic, we will not\u00a0get a more accurate\u00a0determination of what the case\u00a0fatality rate is,\" Fauci said.  ##Town Hall## CNN Corespondent Ivan Watson is in Seoul, South Korea, bringing the latest developments there to the ongoing town hall. \"The confirmed number\u00a0of infections has\u00a0crossed the 6,200 mark with at\u00a0least 42 people who have died as\u00a0a result of the disease.\u00a0More than 70% of the infections\u00a0have originated around the\u00a0southern Korean city of Daegu,\" Watson said. Some context: Daegu is where the Shincheonji religious group is based -- more than half of all cases nationwide have links to the group. Daegu is also near where a US soldier, his wife, and child were infected. Aggressive testing: \"More than 150,000 tests have been\u00a0conducted since the virus first\u00a0appeared here, and the\u00a0authorities are working so hard\u00a0to expedite this.\u00a0There are even drive-through\u00a0testing facilities to speed up\u00a0the process and to limit the\u00a0exposure of doctors and nurses\u00a0to potential carriers,\" Watson said. To put that into perspective: About 1,500 people have been tested for coronavirus in the US so far, said CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta -- \"a magnitude of difference.\" ##Town Hall## The death toll from the coronavirus has increased by 30 in mainland China, bringing the total number of fatalities in the country to 3,042, according to China\u2019s National Health Commission. Confirmed cases in mainland China increased by 143 on Thursday, 126 of which were in Hubei province -- ground zero for the outbreak. That means there were 17 new cases reported in China outside of Hubei, according to the NHC. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China is now 80,552, bringing the global total to 97,852, according to CNN's tally. The NHC added that a total of 53,726 patients across mainland China have recovered and been discharged from hospital. There have been at least 341 deaths reported outside of mainland China, raising the global death toll to 3,383. Here's where those deaths have been reported: Italy: 148 deaths\nIran: 107\nSouth Korea: 42\nJapan: 12\nUnited States: 12\nFrance: 7\nSpain: 3 \nHong Kong: 2\nIraq: 2 Taiwan, Australia, Thailand, the Philippines, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have each reported 1 death. ##Asia## CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour is tuning into the town hall from London, where she's been covering the outbreak in the UK. \"Here they were talking about\u00a0containment.\u00a0Now the chief medical officer\u00a0says they are moving into the\u00a0so-called second phase, which is\u00a0control.\u00a0And then there is research and\u00a0mitigate.\u00a0But that's what's happening\u00a0right now,\" Amanpour said. Shortages: \"There is a national shortage of\u00a0nurses,\" she said. \"Testing kits are in short\u00a0supply, not only here but around\u00a0the world.\" Preventative measures: \"There is a sense that they might\u00a0have to go into methods such as\u00a0controlling how people work,\u00a0keep them at home more.\u00a0And it's called social\u00a0mitigation.\u00a0So also as you were talking\u00a0about how do people deal with\u00a0each other, social distancing,\u00a0for instance.\u00a0There is a huge amount of talk\u00a0about should people shake hands,\u00a0should they hug, kiss.\" \"The main advice that people here\u00a0are being given is wash your\u00a0hands, and wash them over and\u00a0over again.\u00a0And if you use sanitizer, use\u00a0something that's at least 60%\u00a0alcohol contained.\" ##Town Hall## David Culver, CNN's China correspondent, is weighing in at the town hall on the situation in China. He is calling in from Shanghai. \"We've seen these fluctuations\u00a0going up and down (in case numbers),\" Culver said. \"It seems in Shanghai things are\u00a0under control.\u00a0You look at the numbers in Hubei (province),\u00a0it's rather intense.\u00a0Tens of thousands of people have\u00a0been impacted by this and\u00a0thousands have died.\" What it's like in Hubei: \"We talked to folks an hour or so\u00a0ago, I was on the phone with one\u00a0resident checking in.\u00a0They cannot leave their homes.\u00a0They're sealed within their\u00a0residential complexes.\u00a0Basic necessities come to them.\u00a0Outside of that, here in Shanghai, a\u00a0lot more flexibility and freedom\u00a0to move around,\" Culver said. Is the data trustworthy? \"We've been asking that question,\u00a0too,\" Culver said. \"We were\u00a0hearing on the ground from folks\u00a0who said, 'We know we might have\u00a0it because our loved ones have\u00a0been confirmed.\u00a0We're experienced the same\u00a0symptoms, yet testing has been\u00a0delayed.\u00a0It's not coming through.'\" On testing: \"We can say that the\u00a0federal government here, the\u00a0central government under\u00a0President Xi Jinping, they have\u00a0moved forward with getting a lot\u00a0of those test kits to where they\u00a0need to be and it seems as\u00a0though they are coming to a\u00a0place where they are being\u00a0readily available,\" said Culver. ##Town Hall## Gary Tuchman, CNN's National Correspondent, is laying out the facts on the Washington nursing home at the center of the state's outbreak. \"We need to mention\u00a0there has not been widespread\u00a0transmission here in Washington\u00a0state.\u00a0But that being said, this\u00a0nightmare scenario that's taking place\u00a0at this small nursing home\u00a0northeast of Seattle does not\u00a0bode well,\" Tuchman said. Around the US, 12 people have died. Seven of those lived inside this nursing center in Kirkland, Washington. \"That means more than 50% of the\u00a0people we know died from\u00a0coronavirus lived here,\" Tuchman said. \"We don't know how the virus got\u00a0inside this building.\u00a0We do know that other people who\u00a0live here, other people who work\u00a0here, and other people who visit\u00a0here are also sick and they are\u00a0dealing with that right now.\" No testing done: Family members of residents in the center told CNN that no testing has been done for these asymptomatic residents. \"Despite all the talk of testing,\u00a0these loved ones want their\u00a0relatives to be tested,\" said Tuchman.\u00a0\"If they're not sick, they want\u00a0to get them the heck out of\u00a0here.\u00a0If they are sick they realize\u00a0they need to stay.\u00a0But they don't want to take a person\u00a0who might be infected to infect their\u00a0loved ones and infect the\u00a0public.\" Watch: ##Town Hall## The Department of Homeland Security notified employees Thursday evening that a DHS employee in the Seattle-area tested positive for coronavirus. The department said the employee is \"already recovering from his flu-like symptoms and is at home with this family.\" \"We are working directly with each DHS employee in that building to identify who may have been in contact with the employee and at a higher risk of exposure,\" DHS told employees in an email Thursday. \"If identified as being at high risk, we encourage an employee to conduct themselves according to CDC guidelines and take appropriate steps outside the office. In addition, we have been identifying the co-workers who would be at low risk of exposure, so they may return to work in the building as soon as possible.\" Earlier this week, acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf announced that he closed a DHS facility in King County, Washington and directed employees to work remotely, if possible, after learning that an employee had visited a family member at the Life Care Facility in Kirkland, Washington before it was known the facility was impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. The office is temporarily closed and all employees had been directed to self-quarantine. Wolf also told lawmakers this week that any other possible closures of DHS facilities will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. \"I\u2019m not going to contemplate about what could be potential closings, we\u2019ll take that on a case-by-case basis,\" he said. ##United States## CNN's town hall on the coronavirus has begun -- for the next two hours, CNN correspondents and medical experts will discuss the facts and fears around the outbreak. But first, they're starting with what we do and don't know. We know the numbers: We are fast approaching 100,000 global cases, and already have seen more than 3,000 deaths.  \"We know the virus is spread\u00a0through coughs and sneezes and\u00a0droplets just like the flu, but\u00a0it doesn't linger in the air\u00a0like measles or small pox,\" said CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent\u00a0Sanjay Gupta. What we don't know:\u00a0\"We don't know for sure how long\u00a0it lives on surfaces and we\u00a0don't know why it appears that\u00a0children don't seem to be hit as\u00a0hard as adults.\u00a0Nor are we fully certain that if\u00a0you catch it once, you can't\u00a0catch it again.\u00a0And we don't know for certain\u00a0when this might end,\" Gupta sa Watch:  ##Town Hall## At least 2,773 people are in home isolation across New York over coronavirus fears, according to a statement from Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office. These people are all travel-related cases, and are self-monitoring for possible symptoms, New York City Health spokesman Patrick Gallahue told CNN. The health department is in contact with those individuals, de Blasio told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. ##United States## The South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that 518 new cases of the novel coronavirus were recorded on Thursday, bringing the national total to 6,284. The country also reported seven new deaths, bringing the national death toll to 42. Among the 518 new cases\u00a0recorded on\u00a0Thursday, 367 are from the city of Daegu, where the outbreak has been concentrated. A total of 4,693 cases during the outbreak have been from Daegu. Of the cases\u00a0recorded on\u00a0Thursday, 123 are from North Gyeongsang province, which surrounds Daegu. About 90% of cases nationwide are from Daegu and North Gyeongsang province. ##Asia## CNN's Anderson Cooper, Chief Medical Correspondent\u00a0Sanjay Gupta, international correspondents, and a number of medical experts are gathered tonight for a town hall on the coronavirus -- the facts, the fears, and what you should do. What time is it happening? The two-hour event has just begun and will air live until midnight ET. How can I participate?

Relatives said at least two more residents have died without an immediate answer as to whether they were infected. Pat Herrick says her mother died at the nursing home early Thursday morning, but according to Herrick, a staffer called her hours later, erroneously stating that her mother\u2019s condition was stable.\u00a0 Herrick says she does not blame the nursing home workers and appreciates their hard work, but believes they are overwhelmed without enough resources.\u00a0Herrick says her mother was never tested for the novel coronavirus.

The other four cases have no connection to any previous cases. Two individuals returned from recent travel to Iran. Another is a resident of Seattle, and was visiting her family in the region. The last is a person whom was found to be positive as the hospital was routinely checking for influenza. Officials are identifying her as a community case and are investigating.

Colorado officials announced the state's first two presumptive positive case of coronavirus, according to a statement from the Colorado Department of Public Health. The first case is in an out-of-state visitor to Summit County. The visitor is a man in his 30s.\u00a0 When the man arrived at Denver airport on February 29, he was asymptomatic. He developed symptoms two days ago, was tested yesterday and today the state lab said the test was positive. The man was advised to go to a lower altitude and relocated to Jefferson County, the governor added. Coronavirus\u00a0makes people sick, usually with a mild\u00a0to moderate\u00a0upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold.\u00a0 The man is in isolation and his fiancee is in quarantine. Two friends from Colorado have been given quarantine directions, the governor said. Gov. Jared Polis said the man traveled to Italy in mid-February and had a travel companion who has had a positive coronavirus test in another state. We don't know much about the second case yet: Polis said he received word of the second case while preparing for a news conference about the first case. \"We hope to have details on that later today,\" he said. ##United States## A French member of parliament is hospitalized in serious condition after being infected by the coronavirus, the speaker for the country\u2019s lower-house said late Thursday.
