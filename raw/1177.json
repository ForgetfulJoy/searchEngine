Bernie Sanders on Sunday contrasted his voting record in Congress against former Vice President Joe Biden's, highlighting several measures Sanders voted against that Biden voted for.  \"I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the bankruptcy\u00a0bill, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the war in Iraq,\u00a0which was also a tough vote, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against disastrous\u00a0trade agreements like (North American Free Trade Agreement) and (permanent normal trade relations) with China,\u00a0which cost this country over 4\u00a0million good-paying jobs. You voted for it,\" Sanders said at Sunday's debate.  \"I voted against the Hyde\u00a0Amendment, which denies low-income women the right to get an\u00a0abortion.\u00a0You have consistently voted for\u00a0it. I don't know what your position is on it today,\" Sanders said.  \"We can argue about the merits of the bills. It takes courage sometimes to vote, do the right thing,\" Sanders said.  Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden responded by attacking Sanders' past opposition to the Brady Bill that was aimed at curbing gun violence.  \"(Sanders) voted against the Brady Bill five times. Background checks ... Five times,\" Biden said.  \"This man is the only, one of the few Democrats I know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued,\" Biden continued. \"Talk about a special, special interest. We should be able to sue drug companies. We should be able to sue tobacco companies. We cannot sue gun manufacturers because he voted for that years ago. He says it was a mistake now. I'm prepared to accept be says it's a mistake.\" \"The question is what do we do from this point on,\" Biden said.  Here's how Sanders and Biden voted on each bill when they were both in Congress:  Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)  The Defend of Marriage Act is a 1996 law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman.

The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key part of the law that denied to legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses. Biden announced that he supported same-sex marriage in 2012 when he served as vice president, famously getting ahead President Barack Obama on the issue. Biden said at Sunday's debate, \"I'm\u00a0the first person to go on\u00a0national television in any administration and say 'I\u00a0supported gay marriage.'\" Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 was effort to prevent consumers from abusing the bankruptcy system by clearing all their debts when they might have the ability to repay at least some of them.

Biden, whose state of Delaware is the home of several major credit card companies, was a leading proponent of the bill in the Senate and voted for it. He and Warren clashed over the bill when she was a Harvard professor and vocal opponent.

Hyde Amendment  The Hyde Amendment is a measure that blocks federal funds from\u00a0being used for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is in danger.  Once a longtime supporter of the Hyde Amendment, Biden reversed his position in June of last year amid criticism from\u00a0his 2020 Democratic rivals.  \"If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code,\" Biden said.  While Sanders has been critical of Biden's past support of the measure, he has voted for large spending bills that included the Hyde Amendment.  CNN's Dana Bash asked Sanders in June, \"Is it misleading, Senator, to say that you have never voted for it?\" Sanders said that sometimes \"in a large bill, you have to vote for things you don't like. But I think my record as being literally 100% pro-choice is absolutely correct.\""], "Language": false}
