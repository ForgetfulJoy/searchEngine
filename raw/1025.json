Pence said that more than 195,000 Americans have been tested for the virus. Pence noted that number does not include county hospitals or health care labs around the country.  Currently, only 19,343 tests have come back positive, Pence said. Earlier Saturday: President Trump told reporters that Congress is close to reaching a deal on a proposal for the next stimulus bill to deal with the pandemic. On Saturday, congressional and administration negotiators entered a crucial day in the effort to deploy more than $1 trillion in emergency stimulus to a staggering economy, with a growing consensus on a final agreement, but a handful of significant hang-ups still needed to be resolved. Vice President Mike Pence announced Saturday during a coronavirus task force meeting that the Department of Health and Human Services has placed a huge order for N95 masks needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. \"I am pleased to\u00a0report to the President today\u00a0that HHS just placed an order for\u00a0hundreds of millions of N95\u00a0masks made available to health\u00a0care providers across the\u00a0country,\" Pence said. Pence then addressed the need to postpone certain medical procedures across the US out of precaution. \"On behalf of the President, we\u00a0do renew the call for Americans\u00a0to postpone elective medical\u00a0procedures, including dental\u00a0services, and this is another\u00a0way to make sure that the\u00a0medical supplies are available,\u00a0by postponing elective medical\u00a0procedures, you are freeing up\u00a0medical supplies for those\u00a0dealing with the coronavirus,\" he said. ##Health## There are\u00a021,240\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to CNN Health\u2019s tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the country through its public health systems.

Some context: Congressional and administration negotiators on Saturday entered a crucial day in the effort to deploy more than $1 trillion in emergency stimulus to a staggering economy, with a growing consensus on a final agreement, but a handful of significant hang-ups still to be resolved. Bipartisan groups of senators worked late into Friday night with top officials from President Donald Trump's administration to lock in a final agreement \u2014 an agreement that people directly involved in the negotiations tell CNN could top a cost of $1.5 trillion \u2014 before falling short of a midnight deadline imposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser to Trump, went even further on the overall scope the package Saturday, telling reporters it could top $2 trillion. \"The package is coming in about 10% of GDP, it's a very large package,\" Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said. Ten percent of gross domestic product is roughly $2 trillion.

Roughly 25,000 cases have been registered in the country, that is \"basically 5,000 new cases since yesterday,\" said\u00a0Maria Jose Sierra, director of the\u00a0Coordination Center for Health Alerts and Emergencies. Spanish health authorities also reported a 5% mortality rate based out those hospitalized or receiving hospital assistance. \"As of today, we have 1,326 deaths, which gives us a mortality rate of about 5%,\" Sierra said.

Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference Saturday. At least 45,000 people have been tested for Covid-19, the governor said. About 15% of those cases are being hospitalized. \"The more test you take, the more positives you find,\" Cuomo said. ##Health## New York state is sending 1 million N95 masks to New York City, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.  \u201cIt won\u2019t get us through the crisis, but it will make a significant contribution to New York City\u2019s mask issue,\u201d Cuomo said. Apparel companies are converting to mask manufacturers in New York and Cuomo said he is exploring the state of New York manufacturing masks. ##Health## Gov. Andrew Cuomo spoke today on what New York state is doing to respond to the growing coronavirus epidemic. At the top of Cuomo's list is increasing hospital capacity, building beds and seeking out locations to help treat a growing number of infected. \"Every piston is firing.\u00a0Everything that can be done is\u00a0being done.\u00a0New Yorkers are lucky we have a\u00a0very experienced team that's\u00a0doing this.\u00a0This is not their first rodeo,\u00a0they've been through a number of\u00a0emergencies on a number of\u00a0levels\" Cuomo said Saturday during a press conference. \"Increasing hospital capacity.\u00a0We want to get the capacity of\u00a050,000 up to a minimum of\u00a075,000.\u00a0We told the hospitals we're\u00a0going to be ending elective\u00a0surgeries.\u00a0We're now working with hospitals\u00a0to reconfigure the space in the\u00a0hospital to get more beds and to\u00a0find more staff to manage those\u00a0beds.\u00a0We're working on building new\u00a0beds.\" Cuomo said he will be looking at the Javits Center, SUNY Stony\u00a0Brook and the Westchester County Center, among other places, as possible treatment locations. ##Health## Health officials in New York City and Los Angeles County are signaling a change in local strategy when it comes to coronavirus testing, recommending that doctors avoid testing patients except in cases where a test result would significantly change the course of treatment. A news release from the Los Angeles Department of Public Health this week advised doctors not to test those experiencing only mild respiratory symptoms unless \u201ca diagnostic result will change clinical management or inform public health response.\u201d The recommendation reflects a \"shifting from a strategy\u00a0of case containment to slowing disease transmission and averting excess morbidity and mortality,\" according to the statement.  The guidance said coronavirus testing at L.A. County public health labs will prioritized those with symptoms, health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities, paramedics and other high-risk situations. Others are encouraged to simply stay at home. At about the same time, the New York City Department of Health directed all healthcare facilities to immediately stop testing non-hospitalized patients for Covid-19.\u00a0 \u201cAt this point in the pandemic, demand for unnecessary testing is contributing to the rapidly diminishing supply of PPE and leading to a decreasing supply of swabs and viral transport media used to collect diagnostic specimens for Covid-19 testing,\u201d a statement read. \u201cTesting may play a more significant role after the pandemic has peaked.\u201d\u00a0 Some context: The strategy shift essentially codifies the reality health departments have been living with for weeks; a shortage of tests and protective equipment amid rising demand and case numbers.  It also puts into practice advice from many of America\u2019s top medical experts, including CNN\u2019s Dr. Sanjay Gupta, that a positive test result is not required to treat the symptoms. Naturally, limiting testing in America's two largest population centers would also likely lead to widespread under-counting of total cases. ##Health## The United Kingdom government is urging shoppers to act responsibly amid panic buying sparked by the coronavirus outbreak. At the daily press briefing held at Downing Street, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, George Eustice, appealed for shoppers to think of others. \u201cBuying more than you need means that others may be left without. And it is making life more difficult for those frontline workers\u2026 who are working so hard in such difficult circumstances,\u201d Eustice said. \u201cThere is more than enough food to go round,\u201d Eustice said, adding that the supply chain is able to step up to meet demand. Many supermarket shelves have been left empty in recent days.\u00a0 National Medical Director of the National Health Service (NHS) Stephen Powis says the panic buying has left some health workers unable to get food at the end of a long work shift. \u201cFrankly, we should all be ashamed that that has to happen,\u201d he said, referring to a critical care nurse who posted a tearful video on social media when she was unable to buy food. \u201cThese are the very people that we will all need,\" Powis added. ##Daily Life## President Trump's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, is closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mar-a-Lago members were informed late Friday night, a member said. More context: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday ordered all beaches in Palm Beach County to close, although it was unclear if that applies to private beaches and whether there will be an update Saturday reflecting that information. DeSantis issued an executive order on Friday directing all beaches, movie theaters, concert houses, auditoriums, playhouses, bowling alleys, arcades, gymnasiums and fitness studios to close in Palm Beach County and neighboring Broward County. ##Business## Egypt announced the closure of all mosques for two weeks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to the Ministry of Endowment on Saturday. The Ministry also decided to stop group prayers \"based on the scientific opinion of the Egyptian Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization and other health organizations in various countries of the world that confirm the severe danger of gatherings in the transmission of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) and the threat this poses to the life of human beings.\" ##Daily Life## As the US has lagged behind other advanced nations in testing for the coronavirus, former government officials and public health experts point to a series of policy and procedural decisions that they say hindered the nation's response to the pandemic. South Korea had run more than 300,000 tests as of Friday, and while there is no official count of tests done in the United States, Dr. Deborah Birx, part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, implied about 170,000 people have been tested so far. The US population is more than six times that of South Korea. For weeks public and private labs have raced to boost their testing capacity, but people across the country, even some with underlying health conditions, have told CNN this week that they have not been able to get tested. Asked Friday whether the US can currently meet demand for tests, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, \"We are not there yet.\" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's first test didn't work Some context: In January, shortly after Chinese authorities identified a novel coronavirus as the cause of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, the World Health Organization published a protocol with instructions for any country to manufacture tests for the virus Rather than using that protocol, the CDC developed its own test. A World Health Organization spokesperson said this week that the WHO didn't offer tests to the CDC because the US agency typically has the capacity to manufacture them itself. ##Health## The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Portugal doubled to 12 in the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s Directorate-General for Health announced Saturday. There have also been a further 260 confirmed cases, taking the total to 1,280.\u00a0 Portugal\u00a0declared a state of emergency over coronavirus Wednesday, scheduled to last 15 days. The decision gives the government more powers to restrict rights,\u00a0access funds and set minimum public services, among others. However Prime Minister Antonio Costa said \"democracy won't be suspended.\" The country was a dictatorship for decades before democracy was restored in 1974. Spain has reported a further 324 coronavirus-related deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the  total to 1,326, said the health ministry. There has been a 25% jump in the number of overall cases in Spain, according to figures released Saturday. The new total is 24,926. On Friday the government announced an extra 50,000 medical workers would be deployed to tackle\u00a0the outbreak. Minister of Health Salvador Illa said the thousands of new staff include resident doctors, senior year medical and nursing students, and 14,000 recently retired doctors and nurses.\u00a0The measures aim to \"reinforce the public health system and fight and contain the Covid-19,\" the minister said. A 210 million-euro aid package which aims to help regional governments \"prepare for a fast response in urgent cases\" was also announced. \u00a0The allocation of funds depends on the number of people affected in each region, the government said. Illa also announced that a package of quick coronavirus tests should arrive \"in the next few days\" to allow testing of the \"most vulnerable groups\" and those at home \"with light symptoms.\" ##Health## Angola\u2019s Health Minister Silvia Lutucuta has confirmed two patients tested positive for coronavirus, the first cases in the country. In a press conference, Lutucuta said the test results were confirmed in the early hours of Saturday morning. \u201cWe would like to say that these two patients have been through Lisbon in Portugal and arrived on flights on the 17th and 18th,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to mention that they are both men, aged between 36 and 38 years old, residing in Luanda and both are under supervision in our facilities.\u201d Lutucuta says it\u2019s important that people continue to remain calm and follow the advice of authorities. ##Health## All international flights to and from Pakistan will be suspended until April 4, according to an official statement Saturday.

Airlifts will transport patients in critical condition from the city of Mulhouse in eastern France to the Aquitaine region in the west, according to a statement from the French Ministry of Armed Forces. The number of coronavirus patients in Mulhouse has spiked since the start of March. As of Friday afternoon,\u00a01,551 people had been hospitalized in the Grand Est region, where the city is situated. Of the total, 352 are in intensive care and nearly 9% are under the age of 60. The number of coronavirus cases in France has been rising rapidly in the last few days, and the government has imposed strict measures to try to contain its spread, including closing cafes, public spaces and schools. ##Health## In a press conference, US President Donald Trump said a drug called chloroquine could be a \"game-changer\" in treating coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director, says\u00a0he doesn't think it was described that way. ##Health## Texan newly-weds Jay and Carmen Martinez went straight from celebrating their beachside wedding to embarking on a globe-trotting honeymoon cruise across the South Pacific on board the Norwegian Jewel.

The novel\u00a0coronavirus outbreak\u00a0is raging in China, but fewer than 1,000 people have been infected outside the country. With the virus out of sight and mostly out of mind, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stands just shy of 30,000 points, driven by the longest US economic expansion in history. What investors couldn't know is that over the next 30 days, the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0would burst out of quarantine in China, with major outbreaks in South Korea and Italy, then Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It brought business to a sudden stop, sent stock markets into a meltdown and forced central banks to take emergency action on a scale even greater than during the 2008 global financial crisis. A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion and some experts warn that the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression.

Over the last 24 hours 123 people have died from the virus, raising the death toll to 1,556, said Jahanpoor. A total of 7,635 patients have so far recovered, Jahanpoor added. Iran has the most coronavirus cases in the Middle East, and is in an ongoing state of economic crisis. US sanctions on the country have seen its currency tank and unemployment grow. The sanctions also mean Iran is struggling to access coronavirus test kits due to US sanctions, a\u00a0board member of Iran\u2019s Association of Medical Equipment Importers told the semi-official news agency ILNA in February. Ramin Fallah told ILNA that \u201cmany international companies are ready to supply Iran with coronavirus test kits, but we can\u2019t send them money\u201d because of the US sanctions. ##Health## Most people who contract the\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0experience\u00a0mild symptoms, according to data from China, where the worst of the epidemic\u00a0now appears to be over.

When Covid-19 hit China, I was concerned, as were many public health professionals, about what could happen and urged\u00a0rapid action\u00a0to\u00a0understand more\u00a0and prepare. But few of us anticipated the catastrophic impact the new virus has had in\u00a0Wuhan, in\u00a0Italy\u00a0and may soon have in many other places. For most people, there is simply no frame of reference for this pandemic. Never in our lifetime has there been an infectious disease threat as devastating to society. Never in our lifetime have we seen a rich country like\u00a0Italy\u00a0face the need to\u00a0ration respirators.

A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion -- and some experts warn the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression.

Forty-one were imported from overseas. Singapore and the UAE announce first deaths: Both countries reported two coronavirus-related fatalities Saturday. A grim situation in New York: The number of cases in New York state has skyrocketed in recent days to more than 8,300 -- at least 6,000 more than any other state -- though the difference is likely due in part to the fact that health authorities there have been testing more people. On Friday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all non-essential New York workers to stay at home, and said the state may need more medical supplies to deal with the influx of new cases. A vice presidential staffer tested positive: A staff member in\u00a0US Vice President Mike Pence's office has contracted the novel coronavirus, Pence's spokesperson said Friday evening. Pence is leading President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force. Calling in the military: Italy called in its armed forces to help enforce quarantine measures in the country. Italy is dealing with the deadliest outbreak of the virus in the world -- more than 4,000 people have been killed, including 627 in a 24-hour period. More than 47,000 people have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. ##Health## ##Business## ##Daily Life## Thailand reported 89 new coronavirus patients on Friday -- the country's biggest single-day jump in new cases since the pandemic began.\u00a0 The Public Health Ministry said many of the new cases are linked to boxing stadiums, which are the biggest sources of infections in Thailand so far.

The move comes a week after US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence announced that Google was building a nationwide testing website, where Americans could answer a questionnaire and be directed to their nearest testing locations. But Google never affirmed the administration's claims, and the website that launched Saturday does not include a testing screener. The site, google.com/covid19, is \"focused on education, prevention and local resources. People can find state-based information, safety and prevention tips, search trends related to COVID-19, and further resources for individuals, educators and businesses,\" Google said in a blog post.

Images of massive crowds went viral Friday, prompting outrage from concerned citizens and members of government. CNN affiliate 7 News Sydney said that \"thousands\" of people had gathered there Friday.  It appears more were planning to do so today, according to David Elliott, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services in New South Wales state. \"What we saw this morning here at Bondi Beach was the most irresponsible behavior of individuals that we've seen so far. We cannot have an active area of community activity where more than 500 people are gathered,\" Elliott said at a news conference in Sydney today. \"It's with a significant level of disappointment that we have to move today to not only remove people from Bondi Beach but use this as an opportunity to remind people that the Health Act must be complied with.\" ##Daily Life## ##Health## ##Travel## Two people have died in Singapore after contracting the novel coronavirus -- the first fatalities in the city-state related to the global pandemic since the virus first emerged there weeks ago. The victims were a 75-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man, according to the Singapore Ministry of Health. They both died in a local hospital. The woman, a Singapore citizen, contracted the virus on February 23. She had chronic heart disease and a history of hypertension. The man, an Indonesian national, also had a history of heart disease. He was infected on March 14. Gatherings canceled: Gatherings of 250 or more people have been banned in Singapore until the end of June to stop the virus from spreading, the Health Ministry announced Friday. For events with less than 250 participants, organizers are required to keep people at least 1 meter (3.3 feet) apart, according to the report.\u00a0\u00a0 Restaurants and entertainment venues can remain open, but a distance of at least 1 meter must be maintained between tables and between seats. The government also urged employers to introduce measures to reduce close physical interactions between employees and facilitate telecommuting when possible.  It also placed a heavy emphasis on personal responsibility, saying:  Social responsibility is a critical factor in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need all Singaporeans to play their part in the fight against COVID-19. Singaporeans should therefore uphold these safe distancing principles for their own private get-togethers, even if these are being carried out in smaller groups. This means reducing the frequency of such activities, and minimizing physical contact with one another. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others.\u00a0We must all do our part to protect ourselves, our family and friends, and the people around us.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Health## ##Daily Life## At least 18,763 people have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to CNN Health\u2019s tally of cases detected and tested through US public health systems.

The groups are: Healthcare workers and first responders with Covid-19 symptoms.\u00a0\nOlder Americans with Covid-19 symptoms.\nIndividuals who have other illnesses that would be treated differently if they were infected with Covid-19. These three groups differ from those\u00a0recommended\u00a0to be prioritized by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC recommends testing for: Hospitalized patients with Covid-19 symptoms.\nOlder individuals and those with chronic medical conditions and/or an immunocompromised state.\nAnyone developing symptoms within 14 days of contact with a presumed or confirmed Covid-19 patient, or travel to an affected geographic area. The APHL recommended that healthy individuals who are not able to get tested should practice social distancing and follow recommendations provided by their state and local public health authorities. The group also suggested that people with mild illness should stay at home, monitor their symptoms and contact a healthcare provider if symptoms worsen. \u201cTesting for individuals outside these three groups is not recommended until testing supplies and capacity become more widely available,\u201d the statement said. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Authorities in Arizona have confirmed the state's first fatality due to the novel coronavirus. The Arizona Department of Health Services said in a press release that the patient was a man his 50s with underlying health conditions. The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is now in the process of notifying close contacts of the individual so they can look out for symptoms. \u201cWe express our deepest sympathy to the family and friends grieving their loved one during this difficult time,\u201d said Dr. Cara Christ, the state health department's director. \u201cCOVID-19 is a serious disease that can be fatal in anyone, especially our elderly population and people with underlying health conditions. We expect to see more cases of COVID-19 in Arizona, and there could be more deaths.

The kits -- along with 10,000 N95 face masks, 100,000 surgical masks and 10,000 items of personal protective equipment -- arrived in Manila on Saturday morning, the agency reported. ##Health## A staff member in\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence's office\u00a0has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, Pence's spokesperson said Friday evening. \"\u202aThis evening we were notified that a member of the Office of the Vice President tested positive for the Coronavirus. Neither President Trump nor Vice President Pence had close contact with the individual,\" said Katie Miller. \"Further contact tracing is being conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines.\" Pence has been the Trump administration's point person on coordinating the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. While the staffer is the closest confirmed case to Pence that is publicly known, it isn't his first potential brush with the virus. At least two people tested positive for the coronavirus after\u00a0attending the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's Policy Conference\u00a0in Washington, which was attended by Pence as well as several lawmakers and aides. Both Pence and President Donald Trump attended the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, where a high-profile attendee also\u00a0tested positive for the coronavirus. Interactions with that attendee sent multiple Republican lawmakers into self-quarantine in the weeks following the conference. There is no indication\u00a0that either Trump or Pence \"met with or were in close proximity to the attendee\" at the conference, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement earlier this month. Read more: US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's invoking\u00a0the Defense Production Act to ramp up production,\u00a0but he hasn't wielded his federal powers yet as health officials voice alarm about potential shortages of lifesaving medical supplies like ventilators and protective gear for doctors on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump\u00a0signed the measure after several people\u00a0urged him to act amid mounting concerns over a supplies shortage, a person familiar with the situation told CNN. But as he signed the emergency bill earlier this week, the administration had yet to conduct a full account of inventory across the nation. Nor had it identified which companies it would need to make what products. That still hadn't been done as of Friday night, this person said, despite Trump insisting the act would be used to acquire \"millions of masks.\" Amid the confusion over whether he'll act or not, several companies have cast doubt on whether the President needs to\u00a0carry out orders under the Defense Production Act at all.\u00a0And several aides have privately advised against it. The Defense Production Act, legislation passed in the 1950s on the cusp of the Korean War, provides the President with a broad set of powers to require businesses to \"prioritize and accept government contracts\" as well as \"provide economic incentives\" to ensure the US has the stockpiles it needs to handle an impending medical crisis. Read more: What are the telling signs that you may have the novel coronavirus, also known as Covid-19? The main list of acute symptoms at this time is actually quite short and\u00a0can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being able to identify those symptoms and act upon them when necessary is critical. Here's what you need to know. Here are some of the symptoms: Fever\nCough\nDifficulty breathing\nFlu and cold symptoms So what should you do? \"At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them with rest, hydration and the use of Tylenol,\" American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris said. That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age, or if you are pregnant -- anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider,\u00a0according to the CDC.

Last month, scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a research paper analyzing the data for the first 72,314 people diagnosed with Covid-19. Epidemiologists say it will\u00a0take a long time\u00a0to fully understand the mechanics of the coronavirus outbreak, but the information published by the Chinese scientists may give some insight into those most vulnerable to infection. The data shows that men and women have roughly the same chance of contracting the virus. When the scientists looked at 44,672 patients confirmed to have the disease, they found there were 106 diagnosed men per 100 women. However, the impact on men appears to be worse -- at least among those who were part of this initial study. While 2.8% of the men diagnosed with the disease died, only 1.7% of women did.

The NHC found no new locally transmitted cases for the third day in a row and confirmed no new cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the pandemic. ##Health## Soldiers were drafted in to help enforce the lockdown in Italy on Friday as officials announced 627 new deaths -- the largest single-day toll anywhere in the world since the coronavirus outbreak began. Desperate scenes have unfolded in the north of the country, particularly the hard-hit Lombardy region where infections first exploded last month, as hospitals struggle to treat thousands of cases. And Chinese medical experts helping Italy deal with the crisis have said the restrictions imposed in Lombardy are \"not strict enough.\" The government has agreed that the military can be used to help enforce the lockdown, the president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, told a news conference on Friday. \"(The request to use the army) has been accepted... and 114 soldiers will be on the ground throughout Lombardy... it is still too little, but it is positive,\" Fontana said. \"Unfortunately we are not seeing a change of trend in the numbers, which are rising.\" Until now, the soldiers had been deployed in the region to ensure general security in the streets. More than 4,000 people have died from the disease in\u00a0Italy, the country's civil protection agency said Friday -- more than any other nation -- and nearly 6,000 new infections were confirmed in the past day, bringing the total to more than 47,000 cases.

In Bridgewater\u2019s model, companies will have a shortfall of $2 trillion \u201cconcentrated in energy and travel and leisure, and about equally divided between large and small companies.\u201d The firm projects a\u00a06% decline in US GDP for 2020, with the biggest hit during the second quarter. The firm also estimates a decline of $12 trillion for global businesses in 2020. \u201cSince this hit to revenues is happening throughout the world, the total hole globally will be roughly three times that \u2014 about $12 trillion. Governments are responding, of course, but in most cases these responses will just mitigate some of the ripple. Governments\u2019 capacities to deal with this hit vary greatly and will be a major driver of markets going forward,\" the report stated. \u201cMany companies will try to fill this gap by drawing credit lines, increasing their debt positions.\" If government policies don\u2019t help fill the gap, companies are likely to dramatically cut spending, which would result in meaningful cuts in employment. Ray Dalio, who founded Bridgewater, is famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis. ##Business## New numbers from the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy show more men are dying from the virus than women, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator told CNN. \u201cThis\u00a0new data about the male-female ratio is really quite striking,\u201d Dr. Deborah Birx told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday evening.  \u201cFrom\u00a0age 50 on, almost twice as many men are dying as women. So that really makes us really have to look into that and understand that, and really, just having the knowledge of that helps us in the United States so we can be very specific in talking to the American people about who to protect and how to protect them,\u201d she said. Birx stressed the significance of underlying and pre-existing medical conditions. \u201cIn Italy, again, most of the individuals who succumb to this disease had three other prior existing medical conditions,\u201d she said.
