It was an exciting announcement for Beyonc\u00e9, who was highlighted for \"The Lion King\" song, \"Spirit.\" Others in consideration for that category include Thom Yorke for \"Daily Battles\" from the film \"Motherless Brooklyn\" and Pharrell Williams for \"Letter To My Godfather\" from \"The Black Godfather.\"  Lady Gaga won the original song Oscar last year for her ballad \"Shallow,\" which was co-written by Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt and Anthony Rossomando. (We all remember her performance at the show with Bradley Cooper.) If Beyonc\u00e9's name is on the final list of Oscar nominees on Jan. 13, there is reason to hope Queen Bey will grace us with a live performance at the ceremony.
