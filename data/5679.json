The soulful Choral group gained international prominence after working with American singer and songwriter, Paul Simon. Over the years, they have wowed fans around the world with their harmonious singing in the traditional Zulu performance style known as isicathamiya. Their work has earned them 19 Grammy nominations, five of which they won.
