Follow the latest developments from around the globe here. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, said he wants to reopen the state in three phases beginning May 8. The governor's office broke down the phases into three colors: red, yellow and green: The red phase, which\u00a0currently applies to the whole state, has the sole purpose of minimizing the spread of Covid-19 through strict social distancing,\u00a0non-life sustaining\u00a0business and\u00a0school closures,\u00a0and\u00a0building safety\u00a0protocols.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs regions or counties move into the yellow phase, some restrictions on work and social interaction\u00a0will\u00a0ease while others,\u00a0such as\u00a0closures of\u00a0schools, gyms,\u00a0and other\u00a0indoor recreation centers,\u00a0as well as limitations around large gatherings,\u00a0remain in place.\u00a0The purpose of this phase is to begin to power back up the economy\u00a0while keeping a close eye on the public health data to ensure the spread of disease remains contained to the greatest extent possible.\u00a0\nThe green phase eases most restrictions by lifting the\u00a0stay-at-home and business closure orders\u00a0to allow the economy to strategically reopen while continuing to prioritize public health.\u00a0While\u00a0this phase will facilitate a return to a \u201cnew normal,\u201d it will be equally important to continue to monitor public health indicators\u00a0and adjust orders and restrictions\u00a0as necessary to ensure\u00a0the spread of disease remains at a minimum.\u00a0\u00a0 By the numbers: Pennsylvania has a total of 35,684 Covid-19 cases and 1,622 deaths, Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said during a news conference today. The state will not allow people to completely go back to work until there are less than 50 cases per 100,000 people for 14 days, the governor said. ##Reopening## Seven additional big cats at New York's Bronx Zoo have tested positive for Covid-19,\u00a0according to the Wildlife Conservation Society, the non-profit organization that runs the zoo. That makes a total of eight big cats who contracted coronavirus at the famed zoo in New York City. Some context: Three tigers and three African lions exhibited symptoms in early April when the zoo announced a 4-year-old Malayan tiger, named Nadia, tested positive for the virus.\u00a0Testing on these six cats now confirm they have Covid-19.\u00a0One more tiger also tested positive despite showing no symptoms. The zoo says all eight\u00a0animals are behaving normally and eating well.\u00a0 The cats were infected by a staff\u00a0member, although it is unclear how the infection occurred. Preventive measure are now in place for all staff who are caring for cats in the four zoos run by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York.\u00a0They include the Bronx Zoo, the Central Park Zoo in Manhattan, the Prospect Park Zoo in Brooklyn and the Queens Zoo.\u00a0 The zoos have been closed since March 16. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp responded on Twitter to President Trump's comments\u00a0that he disagreed \u201cstrongly\u201d with the decision to reopen some businesses in the state. \"Just like the thousands of businesses currently operating throughout Georgia, I am confident that business owners who decide to reopen will adhere to Minimum Basic Operations, which prioritize the health and well-being of employees and customers,\" Kemp tweeted. More on this: Trump, speaking at the coronavirus press briefing, said he thought it was \"too soon\" to reopen certain businesses in Georgia \"I told the governor of Georgia\u00a0Brian Kemp that I disagree\u00a0strongly with his decision to\u00a0open certain facilities, which\u00a0are in violation of the phase\u00a0one guidelines for the\u00a0incredible people of Georgia,\" Trump said during his coronavirus task force briefing this afternoon.  Kemp, a Republican and staunch ally of Trump, on Monday announced Georgia would allow nail salons, massage therapists, bowling alleys and gyms to open Friday.  ##Reopening## The largest union representing Las Vegas casino workers is condemning the mayor\u2019s call for those businesses to reopen immediately. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s statements are outrageous considering essential frontline workers have been dealing with the consequences of this crisis firsthand,\" Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline, who is with the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, said in a written statement. Some context: Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said on CNN today that businesses \u2014 including casinos \u2014 should reopen, but offered no guidance on how to do it safely. \u201cThey better figure it out. That\u2019s their job,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the mayor\u2019s job.\u201d The Culinary Union says it supports Gov. Steve Sisolak\u2019s decision to keep casinos closed, adding, \u201cThe Culinary Union is majority women and people of color, and we are not expendable.\u201d Goodman does not have jurisdiction over the major casinos on The Strip, which are located outside of the Las Vegas city limits and are governed by Clark County.  Commissioner Michael Naft wrote on Twitter that \u201c[Mayor Goodman\u2019s] defiance of Gov. Sisolak\u2019s stay-at-home order is reckless and dangerous.\u201d The Nevada Gaming Control Board says it is not yet safe for the state\u2019s casinos to reopen.\u00a0 \u201cAccording to Governor Sisolak\u2019s medical advisory team, the data related to the spread of COVID-19 does not support the reopening of gaming establishments in Nevada at this time,\u201d the board says in a written statement. ##Reopening## President Trump said Wednesday that he would be tasking an existing White House council, led by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, with determining how to assist minority communities impacted by coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m directing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council led by Sec. Ben Carson to focus its effort on supporting underserved communities impacted by the coronavirus,\u201d Trump said during a press briefing at the White House. The President also said he would be asking South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott to assist in the effort. \u201cThe council will seek input from the private sector and community leaders on how we can best support minority and distressed communities,\" Trump said. According to an executive order establishing the council, it was originally created \u201c\u00a0to carry out my Administration\u2019s plan to encourage public and private investment in urban and economically distressed areas, including qualified opportunity zones.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 Fourth of July celebrations will be held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. this year, President Trump announced today at his coronavirus briefing. \u201cOn July 4th, we\u2019ll be doing what we had on the mall, as you know. We\u2019re going to be doing it. Last year was a tremendous success,\u201d he said. Last year, Trump held a Fourth of July celebration at the Lincoln Memorial in what was called a \u201cSalute to America.\u201d The event included remarks from the President, military tank displays, music from military bands and military flyovers. Trump said that attendance for the Washington event will likely be limited to \u201c25% of what we had last year.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis year, most likely, we\u2019ll be standing 6 feet apart,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The President also compared his Fourth of July celebration turnout at the Lincoln Memorial with Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cI saw a magnificent picture of Dr. Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful \u2014 very similar,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Infectious disease expert\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci championed the mitigation efforts implemented across the US and considers them the \"basis for our being\u00a0able to say that we can now\u00a0think seriously about reopening\u00a0America.\" Fauci's comments come after numerous states, including Georgia and Tennessee, have said they would reopen parts of their economies soon. \"So what has happened is that the\u00a0mitigation that we put in with\u00a0the first 15 days and then the\u00a030-day mitigation program of\u00a0physical distancing worked.\u00a0So it got us to where we are\u00a0today.\u00a0It is a successful formula.\u00a0It is the basis for our being\u00a0able to say that we can now\u00a0think seriously about reopening\u00a0America,\" Fauci said at the White House's coronavirus task force briefing today. Fauci concluded his remarks with a request for lawmakers around the country to be careful to avoid a \"rebound\" of coronavirus cases. \"I plead with the\u00a0American public, with the\u00a0governors, with the mayors for\u00a0the people with the\u00a0responsibility, although I know\u00a0one has the lead to leapfrog\u00a0over things, don't do that.\u00a0Do it in a measured way.\u00a0This is a successful formula. The problem is if we don't do\u00a0that, there is a likelihood that\u00a0we'll have a rebound.\u00a0And the one way not to reopen\u00a0the economy is to have a rebound\u00a0that we can't take care of,\" he said. ##Reopening## See Dr. Fauci's message here:\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper clashed with Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman this afternoon in a must-see interview. Watch it in full here: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said today businesses in his state can start reopening this week. His plan involves three phases and\u00a0\"will not move to the next phase until the data tells us that it's safe to do so,\" Stitt said. Starting on Friday, Stitt said \"personal care businesses\" can reopen for appointments \"only if they adhere to strict sanitation protocols\" and are in communities that do not have more restrictions in place. Those businesses include hair and nail salons, barbershops, spas, and pet groomers.\u00a0 Stitt said restaurants, dining rooms, movie theaters, sporting venues and gyms can open on May 1\u00a0if they maintain \"strict social distancing and sanitation protocols.\"\u00a0 He also\u00a0said\u00a0that places of worship can reopen for in-person meetings or worship on May 1 but noted that staff and volunteers will need to wear masks when interacting with the public.\u00a0 Bars, however, will remain closed He stressed \"even as things begin to open, it is so important that we continue to practice social distancing.\"\u00a0 \"This is a careful and measured approach designed to protect our most vulnerable will safely easing Oklahomans back to work,\" he said. ##Reopening## President Trump said he signed his immigration executive order before the coronavirus press briefing. The order is expected to temporarily halt the issuance of new green cards and work visas \u2014 steps that had already effectively been in place amid the coronavirus pandemic. \"In order to protect our great\u00a0American workers, I've just signed an\u00a0executive order temporarily\u00a0suspending\u00a0immigration\u00a0into the\u00a0United States.\u00a0This will ensure that unemployed\u00a0Americans of all backgrounds\u00a0will be first in line for jobs\u00a0as our economy reopens.\u00a0Crucially, it will also preserve\u00a0our health care resources for\u00a0American patients,\" he said.\u00a0 Trump continued: \"We have to take care of our\u00a0patients, we have to take care\u00a0of our great American workers\u00a0and that's what we're doing.\u00a0So I just signed it just before\u00a0coming into the room, and very\u00a0important.\" Watch Trump's announcement here:  Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced an incremental plan to open specific businesses\u00a0over\u00a0the next\u00a0few\u00a0weeks.\u00a0 If the openings go well, he said, the state will open up even more businesses on May 4.\u00a0 On April 27, elective surgeries will be allowed in clinics and hospitals, but they have to be simple procedures that don\u2019t require an overnight stay. The patient has to have been tested for exposure to COVID-19 before the procedure and must not have any underlying health conditions. Here's a timeline of the reopenings: Restaurants will open on April 29\nGyms and workout facilities on April 30\nBeauty salons and barbers on May 1\nPlaces of worship and larger venues on May 4 Hutchinson said he is very comfortable with these target dates and that they must continue to operate in a sequential fashion so that they can measure results.  ##Reopening## President Trump said he disagreed \"strongly\" with Gov. Brian Kemp's decision to open up parts of Georgia's economy while the coronavirus pandemic continues to threaten the state. \"I told the governor of Georgia\u00a0Brian Kemp that I disagree\u00a0strongly with his decision to\u00a0open certain facilities, which\u00a0are in violation of the phase\u00a0one guidelines for the\u00a0incredible people of Georgia,\" Trump said during his coronavirus task force briefing this afternoon. \"But at the same time, he must do\u00a0what he thinks is right.\u00a0I want him to do what he thinks\u00a0is right, but I disagree with\u00a0him on what he's doing, but I\u00a0want to let the governors do \u2014\u00a0now, if I see something totally\u00a0egregious, totally out of line, I'll do [something].\u00a0But I think spas and beauty\u00a0salons and tattoo parlors and\u00a0barber shops in phase one, we're\u00a0going to have phase two very\u00a0soon.\u00a0It's just too soon.\u00a0I think it's too soon.\" Some context: Kemp, a Republican and staunch ally of Trump, on Monday announced Georgia would allow nail salons, massage therapists, bowling alleys and gyms to open Friday.  In-person church services can resume. And restaurants and movie theaters can open Monday. His order also bars cities from imposing their own restrictions on businesses. It's the most aggressive move yet to reopen a state's economy as Trump optimistically pushes for a May 1 end to some statewide lockdowns. It also\u00a0came as a surprise\u00a0to mayors and some members of Kemp's own coronavirus task force. ##Reopening## Watch the moment here:  President Trump defended the decision to reopen states amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying the virus will not \"be coming back\" in as many cases as the US saw earlier this year. \"And if it comes back,\u00a0though, it won't be coming back\u00a0in the form that it was. It will be coming back in\u00a0smaller doses that we can\u00a0contain.\u00a0What (CDC Director Robert Redfield) was saying and I\u00a0spoke to him at great length, he\u00a0was saying if it should come\u00a0back together, now you have the\u00a0flu and you have the embers of\u00a0corona,\" Trump said. He continued: \"But in my opinion, from everything I've seen, it can never be like anything we've witnessed right now. What we've just gone through,\u00a0we will not go through.\u00a0You could have some embers of\u00a0corona, and you could have a big\u00a0flu system ... We will not go through what\u00a0we went through for the last two\u00a0months.\" Reporter to Trump: How can you say the virus will not come back at the same level?\u00a0 The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clarified comments he made to the Washington Post about how the second coronavirus outbreak could emerge this winter in conjunction with the flu season to make for an even more dire health crisis. \"There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a story published Tuesday. \"And when I've said this to others, they kind of put their head back, they don't understand what I mean.\" Speaking moments ago at the White House, Redfield\u00a0said that the second wave \"could be more\u00a0difficult, more complicated\" and not \"worse.\" \"When I commented yesterday\u00a0that there was a possibility of\u00a0the fall/winter \u2014 next fall and\u00a0winter it could be more\u00a0difficult, more complicated,\" Redfield said today. \"When we had two respiratory\u00a0illnesses circulating at the\u00a0same time, influenza and the\u00a0coronavirus, but I think it's\u00a0really important to emphasize\u00a0what I didn't say.\u00a0I didn't say this was going to\u00a0be worse.\u00a0I said it was going to be more\u00a0more difficult and potentially\u00a0complicated because we'll have\u00a0flu and coronavirus circulating\u00a0at the same time.\u00a0I want to emphasize we continue\u00a0to build the nation's public\u00a0health infrastructure to ensure\u00a0that we have the capacity to\u00a0stay in the containment mode.\" Watch here:  Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Wednesday that\u00a0150,000 Covid-19 tests will arrive in Colorado from South Korea by the end of the week, plus 150,000 swabs coming in May. \u00a0 The state is partnering with Colorado State University to expand testing at skilled nursing facilities, including asymptomatic workers. Officials are also working to deploy \u201chundreds of thousands of antibody tests,\u201d Polis said.\u00a0 \u201cNo amount of testing is enough to reopen the state. If that's all you're doing ... (but) testing will absolutely be a part of going back to work,\" he said. Polis said he will relax the stay-at-home order due to expire on April 26, and Colorado will move to a \u201csafer-at-home\u201d phase starting on April 27. ##Reopening## ##Testing## There are at least\u00a0846,982\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and at least\u00a046,609\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. As states begin to include \u201cprobable deaths\u201d in their counts, so will JHU. In the upcoming days, these changes may show as surges of deaths in the United States.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Johns Hopkins reported\u00a022,093\u00a0new cases and\u00a01,567\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said Wednesday he will likely not extend the state\u2019s shelter-in-place order, which is set to expire Monday. Reeves suggested he might narrow the directive to apply only to the state\u2019s high-risk population, such as the elderly and those with preexisting conditions. He said steps to fully reopen the state\u2019s economy might take weeks, and could happen incrementally by region or county. He promised the process would be cautious and gradual. \u201cWe are not going to be able to switch the light switch from off to on,\u201d Reeves said at a Wednesday news conference. Reeves signaled a final decision on Mississippi\u2019s shelter-in-place order will come by the end of the week. ##Reopening## Montana's stay-at-home order will be lifted Sunday, as part of a gradual and phased reopening of the state, Gov. Steve Bullock tweeted today. His phase one measures outlined in a statement include giving local school districts the option to return to in-classroom learning beginning May 7. Places of worship can become operational on April 26 in a manner consistent with social distancing between people who are not members of the same household. Main street and retail businesses can become operational on or after April 27 if they can adhere to requirements to limit capacity and maintain strict physical distancing. Employers are directed to develop policies to keep employees and customers safe including teleworking when possible, enforcing social distancing protocols, and other measures. Restaurants, bars, breweries, and distilleries can begin providing some in-establishment services beginning May 4. Businesses where groups gather without the ability to social distance including movie theaters, gyms, and other places of assembly will remain closed. Montana\u2019s travel quarantine will remain in effect. \u201cOur new normal is going to look different. This virus isn\u2019t gone from Montana. So as we turn to support our main street businesses and get more families back to work during this time \u2013 as we should \u2013 we must also be sure to continue looking out for those around us and protecting everyone around us,\u201d\u00a0Bullock said.\u00a0 \u201cOnce we begin to reopen, we want to be able to stay open. Our personal responsibility to protect those around us \u2013 particularly those most vulnerable \u2013 remains just as important as any time during this pandemic.\u201d ##Reopening## \u00a0 The Nevada Gaming Control Board has put out guidelines for the reopening of gaming establishments in the state once the temporary closures end.\u00a0 Nevada operations are currently closed under the state's stay-at-home order. The guidelines would go into effect once that order is lifted or changed by the governor. Establishments must send a reopening plan to the audit and enforcement divisions at least seven days before reopening, or as soon as possible, the memo said. The board also listed 18 procedures that licensees should follow and have in place when reopening including that the establishment must comply with all prescribed local, state and federal Covid-19 heath requirements. ##Reopening## Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo announced Wednesday that she will require people to wear face coverings in public to combat the spread of Covid-19 in her county, which includes Houston, Texas. \u201cI\u2019m signing an order requiring folks who absolutely have to go out in public to wear a face covering,\u201d she said wearing a face mask at news conference with Houston\u2019s Mayor Sylvester Turner.\u00a0\u201cWe have to use every tool in the toolbox.\" The order will go into effect April 27 and will last for 30 days, said Hidalgo who emphasized that this new measure is \u201cnot a substitute for social distancing.\u201d Turner will announce a plan tomorrow to distribute 70,000 face coverings \"to vulnerable communities,\" the mayor's office tweeted today. Beginning today, all essential workers in San Francisco, California, can receive Covid-19 testing,\u00a0Mayor London Breed announced at a news conference today.  The expanded testing is available to both public and private sector workers and\u00a0any other resident with symptoms who cannot otherwise access testing, Breed said.\u00a0 \"We want to ensure all frontline and essential employees that leave their homes every day to serve our residents have a fast, easy, and accessible option for testing,\u201d Breed said. \u201cWe also want those who don\u2019t have insurance, or who lack access to health care or access to basic services to know they can be tested through CityTestSF and receive the support and health care they need.\" Breed also announced approximately $10.5 million is being allocated to a response and recovery fund to support vulnerable San Franciscans and small businesses during the pandemic. As of Wednesday, 1,233 San Francisco residents have tested positive for coronavirus and 21 have died, Breed said. ##Testing## Stakeholders have been meeting to discuss how North Carolina might be able to ease restrictions while still protecting its residents, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the state's Department of Health and Human Services.  \u201cI look forward to sharing more ways in what easing restrictions in the state could look like in the coming days,\u201d Cohen said at a news conference Wednesday. Cohen said decisions are currently being made on the state level, and not county-by-county.  \u201cI think making decisions at the county level is incredibly challenging given how people move throughout the counties. The virus certainly does not respect county borders. I think it's reasonable to look at regions, but we have to be guided by the data to do that. And we're going to continue our work here. At the moment, we want to be making statewide decisions,\u201d she said.\u00a0 ##Reopening## Crematoriums in hard hit areas of New York have a backlog of nearly a month and now, volunteers are coming to their aid. Mike Lanotte, the executive director for the New York state funeral directors association, told CNN that volunteers are helping to ease the burden that downstate crematories are experiencing due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Licensed funeral director volunteers, like 58-year-old Dave Penepent,\u00a0work\u00a0with multiple funeral homes to pick up\u00a0and transport\u00a0bodies of the deceased. Penepent, who is also\u00a0an associate professor of Funeral Services Administration at SUNY Canton,\u00a0said, \u201cI knew that with the backlog of human remains down in the NYC area there was going to be the need to find a solution to get these remains to a final resting place.\u201d Some context: In the beginning of April, Penepent created \u201cHands with a Heart\u201d along with four of his students\u00a0who have been deputized as resident funeral directors.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m just offering a hand, and what is in that hand? The hearts of the bereaved families. In the middle of our hands is the grieving hearts of the bereaved,\u201d Penepent told CNN.\u00a0 Over Easter week Penepent said he and his team transported 70 bodies to crematories out of the area to their final resting place.  This past week \u201cHands with a Heart\u201d transported 150 bodies, and Penepent says he is looking at close to roughly 250 human remains to be transported this week. Most bodies are going out of state\u00a0to places like\u00a0Connecticut, Vermont and Pennsylvania. \u00a0 Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said she signed an executive order to temporarily ease licensing restrictions on the state\u2019s healthcare workforce to \u201cadjust to the urgent demands\u201d Covid-19 has placed on the health care system. \u201cThe actions I'm taking today will we move roadblocks and bolster the number of qualified health care workers who are able to contribute to our Covid-19 response at their full professional capabilities,\u201d Kelly said at a news conference Wednesday. The governor said this measure will temporarily wave physician supervision or collaboration requirements from certain medical professionals who are assisting in the state\u2019s response efforts such as physician assistants and registered nurses. The executive order will also permit registered nurses and licensed practical nurses \u201cwho hold a specialty license that is exempt, inactive, or has lapsed within the last five years to provide medical services appropriate to their qualifications,\u201d Kelly said. She added that the order will also allow students enrolled in programs to become licensed, registered, or certified healthcare professionals to help in whatever appropriate roles are necessary to support a facility's response to the pandemic. \u00a0 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday encouraged hospitals to move forward with scheduled surgeries. Newsom emphasized those surgeries include important medical procedures like heart surgery and cancerous tumor. Elective procedures like cosmetic surgery are not a priority, he said. Newsom said allowing hospitals to perform scheduled surgeries is the first phase in returning to normalcy in California. State officials have been asked to draft a plan for reopening parks and beaches in Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo announced on Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cIt's my hope that we will be able to enjoy our parks and beaches in the month of May,\u201d Raimondo said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll be reopening them, like everything else, in a staged fashion, slowly, with new restrictions, incrementally, leading up to an eventual complete reopening.\u201d On Wednesday, Rhode Island announced 365 new coronavirus cases and 10 new deaths, bringing the state total to 5,841 cases and 181 deaths.\u00a0The state has performed a total of 41,722 tests. ##Testing## ##Reopening## New York City has 9,944 confirmed coronavirus deaths and 5,052 probable deaths from the virus,\u00a0according to the city website. The New York City Health Department defines probable deaths as people who did not have a positive Covid-19 laboratory test but their death certificate lists as the cause of death \u201cCovid-19\u201d or an equivalent. The total number of confirmed coronavirus deaths and probable coronavirus deaths in New York City is 14,996. There have been 138,435 coronavirus cases in the city and approximately 35,920 people have been hospitalized, according to the city. ##New York## State budget directors warn that cuts \u201cwill exacerbate the economic fallout from this crisis, as well as impede states\u2019 ability to provide vital services to citizens,\u201d wrote the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) in a letter obtained by CNN that was sent to President Trump and congressional leaders. NASBO paints a grim picture of states\u2019 fiscal health \u201cunless there\u2019s direct federal aid to states,\u201d according to the letter.\u00a0 The group says that \"given the sudden, severe, and unprecedented nature of this crisis and its economic impacts, even with the use of rainy day funds, states will still be forced to cut essential services in order to balance their budgets.\"\u00a0 The letter also notes that the current crisis is worse than the last recession, when states faced a revenue decline of 11.6%.\u00a0\u00a0States today are forecasting declines of up to 20%. However, NASBO says that some budgetary management tools used during the financial crisis, like reducing Medicaid provider payments, \"may be unwise or unfeasible when combating a public health crisis.\"\u00a0 The group also rules out raising taxes and fees given the large rise in unemployment claims. ##Stimulus## Harvard University decided to return federal fund allocated to them\u00a0under the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund after saying they would not do so when President Trump said he would be calling on the university to return the funds the day before. Even though they did not apply for the support, the university said in a statement that \u201cthe intense focus by politicians and others on Harvard in connection with this program may undermine participation in a relief effort that Congress created and the President signed into law for the purpose of helping students and institutions whose financial challenges in the coming months may be most severe.\u201d \u201cAs a result of this, and the evolving guidance being issued around use of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, Harvard has decided not to seek or accept the funds allocated to it by statute,\u201d the statement said, making it clear that the university would be asking the Department of Education to accept the return of their funds.\u00a0 Harvard's decision comes after Trump mentioned the funding during yesterday's coronavirus press briefing. \u201cI\u2019m going to request it,\u201d Trump said during the briefing. \u201cHarvard\u2019s going to pay back the money. They shouldn\u2019t be taking it.\u201d\u00a0 When Trump initially called on Harvard to return their funds, the university held their position firm, writing in a statement, \u201cHarvard did not apply for, nor has it received any funds through the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses. Reports saying otherwise are inaccurate.  The statement continued: \"President Trump is right that it would not have been appropriate for our institution to receive funds that were designated for struggling small businesses. Like most colleges and universities, Harvard has been allocated funds as part of the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. Harvard has committed that 100% of these emergency higher education funds will be used to provide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d Harvard joins Princeton and Stanford in deciding\u00a0to not accept the funds provided to them\u00a0by the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. CLARIFICATION: This posted has been updated to\u00a0clarify that Princeton and Stanford have not yet received funds. \u00a0The US Department of Health and Human Services announced the distribution of billions of dollars in additional federal coronavirus aid money to health care providers from the initial $100 billion allocation in a media briefing Wednesday. Some of the money from the CARES Act will go to reimburse caregivers who treated Covid-19 patients who had no health insurance, HHS Secretary Alex Azar told reporters. Some will also pay for testing uninsured Americans for Covid-19, said the administrator for the HHS\u2019\u00a0Health Resources and Services Administration, Thomas Engels. \u201cAs announced in early April, a portion of the $100 billion Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse health care providers generally at Medicare rates for Covid-related treatment of the uninsured. Additionally, $1 billion from the Family First Coronavirus Response Act will be used to reimburse providers for conducting coronavirus testing for the uninsured,\u201d Engels said.\u00a0 \u201cWhen an FDA-approved vaccine becomes available, it will also be covered,\u201d Engels said. But neither Azar, nor Engels, would provide any more details about the testing provisions in the giant\u00a0coronavirus relief fund or how it might work on the state or local level. A lack of testing has been a critical problem in the spread of the epidemic throughout the United States and is a major requirement for reopening society, according to top health experts. President Trump signed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act into law on March 27 to provide financial assistance to families, small businesses and industries, including health care. ##Testing## Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said that he will introduce his state's reopening plan on Friday. During a news conference today, Hogan described the plan, \"Maryland Strong Roadmap to Recovery,\" as \"a safe, effective and gradual plan, which will allow us to reopen, to rebuild and to recover just as soon as it is safe for us to do so.\" Hogan said the plan has \"four essential building blocks that are needed to be solidly in place before we can be in position to begin lifting restrictions.\" He said the four parts include: Expanding the state's testing capacity\nIncreasing hospital surge capacity\nIncreasing the supply of protective medical equipment\nDeveloping a robust contact tracing operation The state has been working hard and \"making incredible project progress\" on all four areas and as the \"numbers start to improve and look better, we will be in a position to safely reopen our state and get people back to work with these crucial components,\" Hogan said. ##Reopening## Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced that she is evaluating the state's stay-at-home order and plans to make an announcement at the end of the week.\u00a0 Speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Whitmer said the \"data we've received in the last week has shown me that it's time to reevaluate the stay home, stay safe order.\" What the numbers show: Cases in the state are up 999 over the past day and currently stand at 33,966. The state is currently reporting 2,813 deaths, Whitmer said. Hospitalizations peaked roughly 10 days ago and the state has seen a decline since then, the governor added. She also said that they have secured enough medical equipment for hospitals to last at least a week.\u00a0 \"The curve is flattening and starting to stabilize,\" Whitmer added. ##Reopening## Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0announced\u00a0more than $270 million in additional foreign assistance being provided in humanitarian aid and government assistance from the US to countries that need help responding to the Covid-19 outbreak.  This is part of the emergency supplemental funding provided by Congress for the pandemic \u2013 which totals\u00a0$2.4 billion. None of the money is currently scheduled to go to the World Health Organization, given the hold on funding while the administration carries out its review.  \u201cThis pandemic can\u2019t wait for the review,\u201d Jim Richardson, the\u00a0director of US Foreign Assistance Resources\u00a0at the State Department, told reporters today. The acting administrator of United States Agency for International Development, John Barsa, explained that even before the WHO hold, there was already an effort underway at USAID to expand new partnerships and that effort is ongoing as they identify new partners to work with amid the Covid-19 outbreak. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper clashed with Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman in a lengthy interview this afternoon after she advocated for the swift reopening of casinos, hotels and restaurants in the city. Goodman defended her desire to reopen saying, \u201cI\u2019d love everything open because I think we\u2019ve had viruses here for years.\u201d Cooper presented a graphic showing the spread of coronavirus in a restaurant in China. Goodman dismissed it saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t China, this is Las Vegas, Nevada.\u201d \"Wow, that\u2019s really ignorant,\" Cooper responded. \"That\u2019s an ignorant, ignorant\u00a0statement \u2026 yes it\u2019s in China but they are human beings, too.\u201d When pressed by Cooper on whether she\u2019d join casino workers on the casino floor if they reopened,\u00a0Goodman said, \"I don\u2019t gamble.\" ##Reopening## Watch the moment here:  \u00a0 There are at least, 6,010 cases of coronavirus in Boston, and 196 people have died from the disease, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said at a news conference Wednesday.  The city is still not at its peak of cases and the surge is going to continue, he said.\u00a0 Walsh announced a fourth round of funding through the Boston Resiliency Fund. A distribution of an additional $1.7 million in funds will be given to\u00a0at least 20 organizations that support community health centers, veterans, individuals experiencing homelessness, neighborhoods experiencing higher rates of coronavirus, and the Boston Muslim community during Ramadan, Walsh said. The money will also go towards medical equipment for frontline and essential workers.\u00a0 By the numbers: The city has added over 1,000 beds to improve spacing and provide treatment in the homeless shelter system, Walsh said. Boston Hope Medical Center has treated over 290 Covid-19 patients so far, and as of yesterday, it had 169 patients; of which 97 were on the shelter side and 72 in the hospital side, he said. Walsh said he is \u201cupset\u201d with President Trump\u2019s executive order barring new immigration.  \u201cThis would do nothing to protect people from the coronavirus and certainly do nothing to protect our economy,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt was a foolish policy only to distract people from the real issue at hand. Our immigrants need and deserve support.\u201d  Walsh noted that in Boston, 46% of accommodations and food workers are foreign born. Immigrants make up 35% of Boston\u2019s health care workers, 40% of the city\u2019s construction workers and 41% of hospitality workers, Walsh said.\u00a0\u00a0 Trump said Tuesday his order will apply only to people seeking green cards, last 60 days and won't affect workers entering the country on a temporary basis.\u00a0 Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman repeatedly called for the city's businesses to reopen while refusing to provide any social distancing guidelines on how to do so safely. \"I am not a private owner. That's the competition in this country. The free enterprise and to be able to make sure that what you offer the public meets the needs of the public,\" Goodman, an independent, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"Right now, we're in a crisis health-wise, and so for a restaurant to be open or a small boutique to be open, they better figure it out. That's their job. That's not the mayor's job.\" Watch the moment here:  California Gov. Gavin Newsom said there \"is no date\" for when\u00a0the state could reopen and residents could return to normalcy. \u201cNo one wants to share the timeline for the return to normalcy than I do,\u201d Newsom said at his daily press conference. However, \u201cThere is no date,\" he said. \u201cI wish I could prescribe a specific date ... and go back to normalcy,\u201d he said. \u201cI know so many of you demand and deserve clarity.\u201d\u00a0 Newsom warned, \u201cYou will be left wanting.\u201d About lifting restrictions, the governor said, \u201cWe are not prepared to do that today. We won\u2019t wait week to week, when we\u2019re ready, we will make those announcements in real time.\u201d California is looking closely at six key indicators based on health science, not politics, the governor said. Those indicators are: Testing and tracking\nProtecting vulnerable populations\nHospital preparedness, including personal protective equipment\nDeveloping treatments, including vaccines\nThe ability to continue physical distancing, especially at schools and businesses\nThe ability to reinstate stay home orders if needed ##Reopening## \u00a0 California Gov. Gavin Newsom detailed a call with President Trump focused on coronavirus testing materials. As the state increases testing capacity, the overwhelming need is supplies, specifically test swabs, Newsom said he told Trump during a call Wednesday. The President promised that California will receive 100,000 test swabs this week, 250,000 next week, and more the week after, Newsom said. So far, about 465,000 people have been tested for coronavirus in California. ##Testing## Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the state recorded its highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths since the pandemic began. The governor cited 19 deaths and 154 new infections. Walz went on to say it appears the state is climbing the slope. Health Secretary Jan Malcolm said the state expects to see these numbers increase. Two cats in New York have been infected with the novel coronavirus, federal officials announced Wednesday.  Both animals had mild respiratory symptoms and are expected to make a full recovery. \u201cThese are the first pets in the United States to test positive,\u201d the US Department of Agriculture said Wednesday in a joint statement with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agencies emphasized that there is no evidence pets play a role in spreading coronavirus in the United States.  \"There is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare,\" they said. The two cats were tested after they showed respiratory symptoms, according to the agencies, and they join the ranks of a lion and a tiger in New York who were previously confirmed to be infected. A veterinarian tested the first house cat after it showed mild respiratory signs, but none of the humans in its household were confirmed to have the virus. It\u2019s possible, officials said, that the cat was infected by somebody outside the home. Someone inside the house, with mild or no symptoms, could have also transmitted the virus. The second cat, in a separate area of New York, was also tested after it showed signs of respiratory illness. The owner of that cat tested positive for Covid-19 before the cat became ill, but another cat in the household has shown no signs of illness. Coronavirus and pets: Officials are still learning more about coronavirus and pets, but the CDC is recommending that people limit interactions between their pets and people or animals outside the household. Cats should be kept indoors when possible, the CDC said, and dogs should be walked on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals.\u00a0 The agency said dogs should also avoid public places where a large number of people and animals gather, such as dog parks.\u00a0 If someone is ill with Covid-19 \u2013 whether suspected or confirmed \u2013 officials recommend having another member of the household care for pets. An Interior official downplayed President Trump's comments on the reopening of National Parks this afternoon as a major new announcement \u2014 noting that space at some parks has remained open throughout the pandemic response. The official said Interior and the National Park Service will work at the state level to open parks as those individual states begin to reopen, but the expectation at the moment is that the administration won\u2019t move to open parks before the states they\u2019re located in move to at least Phase One of the federal reopening guidelines. More than 75% of hotel rooms in the United States remain empty, according to hotel data and analytics company STR.\u00a0 Nationwide hotels reported an occupancy rate of 23.4% for the week ending April 18, which represents a 64% decrease from the same week last year.\u00a0 The numbers are a slight increase from recent weeks, but STR attributes that to rooms being used by people working to respond to the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is important to state that this is not any type of early-recovery sign,\u201d Jan Freitag, STR\u2019s senior vice president of lodging insights said in a statement. \u201cRather, more demand can be attributed to frontline workers.\u201d New York City, were some medical workers are being housed in hotels, posted an occupancy rate of about 33%, up from a low of about 15% for the week ending March 28.\u00a0 Oahu Island, Hawaii, remains the market with lowest occupancy. Only 8% of the rooms there are occupied. Economists call the latest round of fiscal stimulus a step in the right direction, but warn that more money will be necessary to help both American households and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. \"This bill\u00a0will help address shortfalls,\u00a0but even more stimulus will likely be needed,\"\u00a0said economists at Bank of America in a research note.\u00a0\"We expect Congress to pass another large package worth up to $1.5 trillion that extends on provisions in the CARES Act.\"\u00a0 The US Senate passed a new $480 billion round of fiscal stimulus Tuesday in Washington's latest effort to provide economic relief, including an additional $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses.\u00a0The program ran out of funds last week. \"Demand for this program has been sky high as small businesses, which have limited capital market access, are in need of funds to survive the quarantine period,\" the note said. \"This latest round of funding should go a long way to help those businesses which missed out on the first round of funds. However, it may still fall short of what is ultimately needed, which we estimate to be $900 billion.\" The expanded program also likely won't prevent some small companies from going under. \"Many small businesses that are currently closed or operating at reduced levels could still struggle to remain financially viable, even if lockdowns are progressively lifted over the coming weeks,\" said Rebecca Karnovitz, a Moody's vice president, in emailed comments. \"A wave of small business bankruptcies would weigh on a recovery in employment and economic activity.\" ##Stimulus## Texas Gov. Greg Abbott previewed his upcoming announcement for how Texas will further reopen its economy. There are \"so many different types of businesses,\" including hair salons, that will open back up, Abbott said. Abbott also detailed a patchwork approach in which rural counties may be allowed to open up more businesses than areas that have more community spread.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It won't be fully opened but it will be opened in strategic ways, in ways that are approved by doctors to make sure that we we can contain the coronavirus,\" he said Wednesday on the\u00a0Chad Hasty radio show\u00a0based in Lubbock, Texas.\u00a0 State parks already opened up in Texas on Monday, and limited medical procedures were allowed starting today.\u00a0 On Friday, the state will begin a \"retail-to-go\" approach of allowing retail stores to sell to customers through curbside and delivery.\u00a0 ##Reopening## ##The South## \u00a0 The novel coronavirus appears to be causing sudden strokes in adults in their 30s and 40s who are not otherwise terribly ill, doctors reported Wednesday. They said patients may be unwilling to call 911 because they have heard hospitals are overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. There\u2019s growing evidence that Covid-19 infection can cause the blood to clot unnaturally, and stroke would be an expected consequence of that. Dr. Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, and colleagues gave details of five people they treated. All were under the age of 50, and all had either mild symptoms of Covid-19 infection or no symptoms at all. \u201cThe virus seems to be causing increased clotting in the large arteries, leading to severe stroke,\u201d Oxley told CNN. \u201cOur report shows a seven-fold increase in incidence of sudden stroke in young patients during the past two weeks. Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of Covid,\u201d he added. \u201cAll tested positive. Two of them delayed calling an ambulance,\u201d Oxley said. It is not common for people so young to have strokes, especially strokes in the large vessels in the brain. \u201cFor comparison, our service, over the previous 12 months, has treated on average 0.73 patients every 2 weeks under the age of 50 years with large vessel stroke,\u201d the team wrote in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. That\u2019s fewer than two people a month. A stroke in a large blood vessel causes severe damage if it is not removed right away. At least one patient has died and others are in rehabilitation facilities, intensive care or in the stroke unit. Only one went home but will require intense care, Oxley said. Oxley said his team wanted to tell people to watch themselves for symptoms of coronavirus infection and to call 911 if they have any evidence of stroke. \u201cUp until now, people have been advised to only call for an ambulance with shortness of breath or high fever,\u201d he wrote. The easy memory device for stroke, he said, is \u201cFAST\u201d:\u00a0F for face drooping, A for arm weakness, S for speech difficulty and T for time to call 911. \u201cThe most effective treatment for large\u00a0vessel stroke is clot retrieval, but this must be performed within 6 hours, and sometimes within 24 hours,\u201d Oxley wrote. Federal authorities have flagged hundreds of phony websites related to coronavirus relief to internet domain hosts that are taking them down, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. Bogus charity drives, websites advertising fake vaccines and pages posing as stimulus applications from the Internal Revenue Service have all been busted as part of the effort, DOJ said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cThe department will continue to collaborate with our law enforcement and private sector partners to combat online COVID-19 related crime,\u201d said Brian Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cWe commend the responsible internet companies that are taking swift action to prevent their resources from being used to exploit this pandemic.\u201d As of Tuesday, the FBI tip line for internet crime, known as IC3, has received and reviewed more than 3,600 complaints related to coronavirus scams, DOJ said.\u00a0 Federal law enforcement agencies analyzed the complaints and referred many of them to the private-sector website hosts who then took them down, according to the statement.\u00a0 Last week, the head of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, Tonya Ugoretz, said that IC3 was seeing a surge in reported incidents \u2014 marking 3,000 to 4,000 complaints per day in recent months, up from typical levels of 1,000 per day. \u00a0 A new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that coronavirus can spread quickly in homeless shelters once a cluster of cases occurs. The research, published today, adds to a growing body of evidence showing how certain environments \u2013 including nursing homes and prisons \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus outbreaks. \u201cHomelessness poses multiple challenges that can exacerbate and amplify the spread of COVID-19,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study. Many people experiencing homelessness are older or have underlying medical conditions, they said, and \u201cshelters are often crowded, making social distancing difficult.\u201d Here are some examples: In one San Francisco shelter with a cluster of cases, for example, at least 95 residents had the virus out of 143 people tested \u2013 about 66%. Out of 63 staff members tested, about 16% had the virus.\nIn a Boston shelter that also had a cluster of cases, a smaller but still significant proportion of residents tested positive: 147 out of 408 tested, or 36%. About 30% of staff members tested at the shelter had the virus.\nAmong three Seattle shelters with coronavirus clusters, residents and staff members had a similar rate of infection: 17% of those tested. When shelters had just one reported case \u2013 or none at all \u2013 researchers found a much lower prevalence of infection. Looking at a dozen Seattle shelters with just one case, for example, the study found that 5% of residents tested positive for the virus. And in Atlanta shelters that had reported no cases, researchers found a similarly low \u2013 but still problematic \u2013 rate of infection: 4% of those tested. The study did have some limitations. Namely, testing reflected a single time point, meaning residents could have been infected without yet testing positive. And some residents were not available for \u2013 or declined \u2013 testing. Those factors could mean the true infection rate in homeless shelters is higher or lower than the researchers reported. Still, given that people can spread coronavirus before showing symptoms, researchers said that \u201ctesting of all residents and staff members regardless of symptoms at shelters where clusters have been detected should be considered.\u201d\u00a0 And if testing is easily accessible, they said tests should be offered regularly at shelters \u2013 even before any clusters are identified. ##Testing## Man installs portable sinks to protect homeless on Atlanta streets:  US government employees have been targeted by hackers exploiting the coronavirus outbreak, according to\u00a0new data from Google\u2019s security team\u00a0released Wednesday.\u00a0 The hackers posed as American fast food franchises and offered free meals in response to the coronavirus crisis. The hackers were part of a group that are government-backed, Google said, but the company did not specify what country the hackers were working for. \u201cOne notable campaign attempted to target personal accounts of U.S. government employees with phishing lures using American fast food franchises and COVID-19 messaging. Some messages offered free meals and coupons in response to COVID-19, others suggested recipients visit sites disguised as online ordering and delivery options. Once people clicked on the emails, they were presented with phishing pages designed to trick them into providing their Google account credentials,\u201d Shane Huntley, from Google\u2019s threat analysis group, wrote in a post published Wednesday. Huntely said the vast majority of the messages had been detected by Google\u2019s systems and sent to spam folders, \u201cWe\u2019re not aware of any user having their account compromised by this campaign, but as usual, we notify all targeted users with a \u2018government-backed attacker\u2019\u00a0warning,\u201d he added. \u00a0 The World Health Organization raised global alarm about the coronavirus outbreak \"at the right time,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva on Wednesday. WHO on January 30 declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus to be a public health emergency of international\u00a0concern.\u00a0WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as \"an extraordinary event\" that constitutes a \"public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and \"to potentially require a coordinated international response.\" Previous emergencies have included Ebola, Zika and H1N1. During that time in January, \"outside China we had only 82 cases,\" Tedros said during Wednesday briefing. \"Looking back, I think we declared the emergency at the right time and when the world had enough time to respond,\" Tedros said. \"There were only 82 cases and no deaths. That was enough time. \u2026 This was more than two months and 21 days ago, close to three months now.\" On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Dr. Mike Ryan,\u00a0executive director of WHO\u2019s health emergencies program, said during Wednesday's briefing that \"the\u00a0characterization of the disease as a pandemic in itself has no basis other than a description of the event at that time in regards to how many countries are affected.\" Some background: President Trump announced he is\u00a0halting funding\u00a0to the organization earlier this month while a review is conducted.\u00a0 The US funds $400 million to $500 million to WHO each year, Trump said while announcing the funding freeze, noting that China \"contributes roughly $40 million.\" \"Had WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,\" he said. \u00a0 As governments consider loosening various social distancing measures, such decisions should be made at the \"lowest administrative level,\"\u00a0Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove,\u00a0a World Health Organization infectious disease epidemiologist, said during a media briefing in Geneva on Wednesday. \"It\u2019s not a one size fits all, and what countries need to do \u2013 and what decision makers need to do \u2013 is to evaluate the situation in their countries at the lowest administrative\u00a0level as they can to determine what can be lifted where and when,\" Van Kerkhove said. She continued: \"First and foremost, is to really understand where this virus is, how far it\u2019s being transmitted and if it is controlled. Countries need sufficient systems in place in order to detect any new cases that come up. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t see your families for long periods of time. There may be situations\u00a0where these measures can be lifted, but it has to be done in a controlled way.\" ##Reopening## National Parks will begin reopening, President Trump announced today, as he urged states to reopen after coronavirus closures.  The President made the remarks on the South Lawn of the White House during a ceremony marking Earth Day and Arbor Day. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to open our country again,\u201d the President said, \u201cthanks to our significant progress against the invisible enemy, I\u2019m pleased to announced that in line with my administration\u2019s guidelines for opening up America again, we will begin to reopen our National Parks and public lands for the American people to enjoy.\u201d He then called on Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to comment with more details, but Bernhardt did not come to the podium or have a microphone, so his comments were inaudible. Vice President Mike Pence later commented that the administration would \u201cwork closely with governors\u201d to reopen parks and public lands, \u201cso that the American people can enjoy the blessings of those extraordinary places.\u201d Pence told the Trump that the American people are, \u201canxious to get back to enjoying all those public parks, and will greatly welcome your leadership.\u201d It's unclear the degree to which the President's announcement will affect states and other localities.\u00a0 ##Reopening## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said President Trump agreed to waive the state match for the costs related to using the Federal Emergency Management Agency during their meeting yesterday. \u201cNormally, a state has to pay 25%\u00a0of the FEMA cost.\u00a0That would be a cruel irony for\u00a0New York and adding insult to\u00a0injury,\u201d Cuomo explained. \u201cNew York had the highest number\u00a0of coronavirus cases in the\u00a0country.\u00a0Therefore, our cost of FEMA was\u00a0the highest cost in the nation.\u201d \u201cYou're going to penalize us for\u00a0having the highest number of\u00a0coronavirus cases in the\u00a0country.\u00a0And at the same time, the\u00a0Congress passed a piece of\u00a0legislation not even funding the\u00a0states,\u201d Cuomo said.\u00a0 He said it\u2019ll save the state hundreds of millions of dollars.\u00a0Cuomo also said he talked to Trump about getting more state funding into the next stimulus bill.\u00a0 \u201cThis was not the time for\u00a0baby steps.\u00a0This is when you should be\u00a0taking bold action,\u201d he said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he understands that local officials may feel political pressure to reopen their economies. \"We can't make a bad decision,\" he said. \"Frankly, this is no time to act stupidly, period. I don't know how else to say it.\" Cuomo said reopening prematurely would set back the progress that has been made flattening the curve. He warned communities that have not been hard-hit by coronavirus to keep certain restrictions in place, saying a second wave could \"knock you down.\" Hear what he said: ##New York## ##Reopening## New York will work with New Jersey and Connecticut to launch a \"nation-leading contact-tracing program,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced this morning. \"This is going to be a massive undertaking,\" he said. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg will help develop the first-ever testing/tracing/isolation programs, Cuomo said. John\u2019s Hopkins University and Vital Strategies will help with the tracing operation, he added. Contact tracing is a virus containment strategy that involves finding sick people, isolating them and then tracing everyone with whom they've been in contact with. Those contacts are then put into quarantine. ##New York## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had a \u201cproductive\u201d meeting with President Trump yesterday at the White House. \u201cTo me, a productive visit means\u00a0we spoke truth.\u00a0We spoke facts.\u00a0We made decisions, and we have a\u00a0plan going forward.\u00a0And that was accomplished\u00a0yesterday.\u00a0And I feel good about it\u00a0personally,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor said political differences were placed on the back burner during the meeting.\u00a0 \u201cBy the way, these are people\u00a0in the White House who, politically, don't like me.\u00a0You know, that's the fact,\u00a0right?\u00a0You see the President's tweets.\u00a0He's often tweeted very unkind\u00a0things about me and my brother.\u00a0\u2026 We\u2019ve had conflicts back and\u00a0forth.\u00a0But we sat with him.\u00a0We sat with his team.\u00a0And that was put aside.\u00a0Because who really cares how I\u00a0feel or how he feels?\u00a0Who cares?\u00a0Get the job done,\u201d he said. Cuomo referred to his call to keep politics out of the health pandemic: \u201cWhen you're at war, you're in a\u00a0foxhole.\u00a0\u2026 I don't care what your politics\u00a0are.\u00a0I don't care what you think\u00a0about my politics.\u00a0It doesn't matter.\u00a0We both have a job to do.\u00a0Let's do the job.\u00a0That was the spirit of the\u00a0meeting yesterday,\u201d Cuomo said. Watch the moment: ##New York## Vermont is reporting a downward slope of coronavirus cases and less Vermonters are going into the urgent care or hospital emergency settings with symptoms that might sound like Covid-19, officials said today. \"As you\u2019ve been hearing, our efforts to flatten the curve are starting to make a difference, but this isn\u2019t over yet, and continuing to take action to protect yourself and those around you is really still critical,\" said Vermont Commissioner of Health Dr. Mark Levine said.\u00a0 A month ago, 6% of urgent care or ER visits were for Covid-19 type-symptoms. Now those visits are in the 1% to 2% range, Levine said. There have been approximately 40 coronavirus deaths in Vermont, Levine said, and they have assessed the first 29 deaths. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at least 474 people died across the state from coronavirus yesterday. That is down from 481 deaths in the state on Monday. The governor said the death toll updates are \"the worst news that I have to deliver every day, and the worst news that I've ever had to deal with as governor as New York.\" However, he said death rates are no longer increasing every day and the toll \"seems to be on a gentle decline.\" ##New York## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that, while it feels like the state has been under restrictions for \"terribly long,\" New York is now \"in a much better place.\" \"When you look at the reality of the situation, We are actually in a much better place,\" he said. \"We're at a relatively good place,\" he added. Hospitalization and intubation rates are down. However, the number of new people going into the hospital each day is still \"troublingly high,\" Cuomo said. ##New York## A Tyson Fresh Meats plant in Washington state is now linked to 91 cases of Covid-19, a local health department reports. The beef plant, located in\u00a0Wallula, had their first case of the disease on April 1, Walla Walla County health officials said in a statement. Tyson began to put mitigation efforts in place 5 days later, on April 6, the statement added. The cases are now spread out over the two-county Benton-Franklin Health District and Walla Walla County, officials for both areas said. The Walla Walla County health department, the agency that oversees the plant, said they have \"been in daily communication with Tyson to ensure the required mitigation measures are put in place\" since April 6. \"In addition to the prevention measures we have required Tyson to implement, we are also requiring Tyson to allow the DCH to test all employees for COVID-19,\u201d said Meghan DeBolt, Director of the department, in the later statement. The plant remains open at this time. Earlier, today, Tyson said it will suspend operations at its Waterloo, Iowa, pork plant after nearly 200 coronavirus cases were linked to the plant.  Detroit bus driver Jason Hargrove died from Covid-19 just days after posting an impassioned video plea to warn residents about the seriousness of coronavirus.  His wife, Desha Johnson-Hargrove, described him as a \u201cgentle giant,\u201d an \u201camazing father\u201d and an \u201call-around great man.\u201d \u201cHe proudly put that uniform on\u00a0every day.\u00a0Even after he was sick, not even\u00a0understanding how sick, not even\u00a0understanding that he had\u00a0actually had the virus at the\u00a0time \u2026 but his\u00a0mind was still on going to work\u00a0every day and transporting the\u00a0people of Detroit,\u201d Johnson-Hargrove told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow.\u00a0 Johnson-Hargrove said her message to people is to just stay home while coronavirus continues to affect the US.\u00a0 \u201cThis is real.\u00a0We are not actors.\u00a0We are real people.\u00a0We are real hurting people that\u00a0have suffered a tremendous loss.\u00a0And all I can ask is that\u00a0everyone follow and\u00a0obey the orders of your state,\u00a0of your county, of your cities, whatever they may be.\u00a0Stay home.\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s that simple \u2014 just stay home.\u201d\u00a0 Eric Colts, his best friend and fellow bus driver, said he is still uneasy about going to work, even with personal protective equipment, including and masks. \u201cIn my line of work, you\u00a0never know who you're picking up\u00a0from the next stop to the next\u00a0stop.\u00a0That's something we don't know.\u00a0So to say I feel safe, I\u00a0can't really say that, because\u00a0we're just not sure,\u201d he said.

Tyson said it will suspend operations at its Waterloo, Iowa, pork plant after nearly 200 coronavirus cases were linked to the plant.  Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart said while he\u2019s happy the plant \u2014 which is the the company\u2019s largest pork plant \u2014 is closing temporarily, he\u2019s afraid it may be too late to stop the spread.\u00a0 \u201cAt this particular\u00a0point, we believe that it was too\u00a0late.\u00a0We went from 21 cases of Covid\u00a0on April 9 to about 380\u00a0yesterday, and we even doubled\u00a0that number in two days from 191\u00a0to 380.\u00a0So at this point, closing,\u00a0cleaning, testing people, is the\u00a0best scenario for it,\u201d Hart said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow.  \u201cAnd I understand the impact that\u00a0this has on our national food\u00a0chain, but in order to be able\u00a0to stop the spread, this was the\u00a0best course of action to support\u00a0the workers that prepare our\u00a0food.\u201d\u00a0 Hart previously told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that he was concerned about frontline workers at the plant, many of whom are minorities and immigrants. The plant is one of the city's\u00a0largest\u00a0employers, with some 3,000 workers. Tyson now says all workers will be able to get testing. \u201cIt hurts when it feels like your\u00a0pleas to people falls on deaf\u00a0ears.\u00a0This isn't a political issue.\u00a0It's not a Republican, not a\u00a0Democrat [issue].\u00a0This is a humanitarian issue.\u00a0And we needed proactive steps\u00a0to be able to squash this\u00a0spread,\u201d he said. \u00a0 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says there will be a Macy\u2019s July 4th\u00a0celebration with fireworks, though no details have been hashed out yet.\u00a0 De Blasio said he spoke with Macy\u2019s CEO Jeff Gennette. who agreed that the company wanted to celebrate in some way.\u00a0 \u201cOne way or another, the show will go on,\u201d de Blasio said, adding that fireworks will be a part of the plan.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a day we cannot miss,\" de Blasio said. \"There\u2019s no day like the Fourth of July.\" The mayor said there are a lot of questions that need to be answered between now and the celebration, but that the city will conduct the celebration \u201cin a way that\u2019s safe and smart.\u201d Earlier this week, de Blasio announced that New York City has canceled all non-essential permitted events in June. ##New York## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said there will be increased coronavirus testing to serve the estimated 400,000 people live in public housing locations around the city. Six new testing sites with the priority for NYC Housing Authority (NYCHA) residents will be opened over the next two weeks he said. Three sites \u2013 in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Manhattan \u2013 will open Friday. Three others \u2013 in Brooklyn, Queens and Harlem \u2013 will open next week. Hand sanitizer will be given to thousands of seniors in NYCHA facilities, and all public housing residents will receive face coverings and gloves. The mayor also discussed an expanded free door-to-door meal distribution to NYCHA building seniors so no one will \u201cmiss out on the food they need,\u201d and a $5 million investment for free tablets and internet service to 10,000 NYCHA seniors \u201cso they can stay in touch with family and loved ones and access the services they need.\u201d ##New York## ##Testing## Both Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Tuesday night to express support for the governor\u2019s decision to reopen his state, offering praise and complimenting him on the job he\u2019s doing, according to a source familiar with the call. Another person familiar with the call said it went well. The governor, who made the announcement on reopening his state Monday, did not inform White House beforehand, according to a source familiar with the decision. The source added that Kemp made the decision at least a day before the announcement. Kemp's decision has drawn criticism from\u00a0public health experts who have repeatedly stressed the dangers of relaxing social distancing measures too early. Georgia hit its projected peak for daily deaths on April 7, according to an influential model often cited by the White House.\u00a0 But that same model, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, says that Georgia shouldn't start relaxing social distancing until after June 15 -- when the state can begin considering other measures to contain the virus, such as contact tracing and isolation.\u00a0 CNN's Nick Valencia reported that Candice Broce, Gov. Kemp\u2019s communications and deputy executive counsel, defended the governor\u2019s announcement, saying the state has satisfied all criteria required by the White House to reopen.\u00a0 She called any suggestion otherwise \"inaccurate.\" ##Reopening## ##The South## New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled details on a new initiative called \"test and trace,\" the steps and measures he says would get the city to a low-level transmission phase. \"This is how we ultimately defeat this disease,\" de Blasio said this morning. The mayor gave what he called broad strokes to the approach to the plan, which is based on widespread testing for the disease. If a patient is found to be Covid-19 positive,\u00a0determining who they have been in contact with and testing those people.\u00a0 \"Plenty of sites and plenty of tests,\" de Blasio said.\u00a0 The goal is to make testing available in every community, provide immediate assessment isolation and support, rapidly trace contacts and have more testing available in May. People who test positive will be immediately assessed, isolated, monitored and supported at home or in a hotel or hospital, the mayor said.\u00a0 De Blasio said he would like to identify widespread collection sites to minimize the burden on hospitals and the health care system. The city will also conduct interviews with positive patients to determine who they have been in close contact with.\u00a0 \"If you were in close contact with your cousin, then we want to talk to your cousin,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to take thousands and thousands of people to do this right and we\u2019re putting those people together now.\" ##New York## ##Testing## Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said Monday that \"there are more important things than living\" during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing for a reopening opening of the state\u2019s economy.  But Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner thinks that could upend progress that the state has made in fighting the virus. \"I don't think it's an\u00a0either/or, and I don't think you have to\u00a0provide those type of choices.\u00a0I simply think you just have to\u00a0listen to what the doctors are\u00a0saying, take their advice. \u2026 You don't have to sacrifice\u00a0one group in order to save\u00a0another,\" Turner said.\u00a0 Turner said he agrees that some hospitals can start performing elective surgeries, but reopening shouldn\u2019t go further than that.\u00a0 \"We shut down early in this city.\u00a0So the things that have been put\u00a0in place are working.\u00a0But you have to be very careful\u00a0if you open up too soon.\u00a0You will undo all the sacrifices\u00a0people made.\" Turner also stressed that this health crisis should not be made political. \"It has no respect of persons or\u00a0parties or social or economic\u00a0status,\" he said, adding that 70% of the deaths in the city have been people of color.\u00a0Turner also reiterated that his city needs more widespread testing in order to gauge the reopening of the economy, referring to the response when Hurricane Harvey hit the area in 2017.\u00a0 \"You can look on the radar and\u00a0you knew where the storm was, when\u00a0it was going to hit, when it was\u00a0going to exit.\u00a0For us with this particular\u00a0challenge, the radar happens to\u00a0be testing.\u00a0And it needs to be widespread and it\u00a0needs to be robust,\" he said. ##Reopening## US stocks opened higher today, rebounding after two days of losses brought on by the collapse of oil prices. The oil market continues to be in distress, as global benchmark prices fall to their lowest level since 1999. US oil remains around $14.

The announcement comes as local officials in Black Hawk County, Iowa, had urged the plant to close voluntarily after a suspected outbreak of Covid-19. \u201cProtecting our team members is our top priority and the reason we\u2019ve implemented numerous safety measures during this challenging and unprecedented time,\u201d Steve Stouffer, group president of Tyson Fresh Meats\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cDespite our continued efforts to keep our people safe while fulfilling our critical role of feeding American families, the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns has resulted in our decision to stop production.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Black Hawk County health department announced Tuesday that 182 of the county's 374 cases are linked to the Tyson Waterloo plant.\u00a0 The Board of Health voted yesterday to pass a proclamation urging Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Tyson Foods to temporarily close the Waterloo plant for deep cleaning and to test employees.  Last week, two dozen local and state elected officials \u2014 including Waterloo's Mayor \u2014 sent a letter formally requesting Tyson shut down the plant due to the outbreak.\u00a0Mayor Quentin Hart told CNN he was afraid if action wasn't taken soon, his city could be the \"next hot spot.\" Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the US needs to focus on its lack of testing in the country \u2014 not on how we compare to other countries.\u00a0 While answering viewers' questions this morning, he was asked about the US's testing numbers. \u201cAt the White House briefings, it\u2019s often mentioned that the US has\u00a0done more testing than any other\u00a0country.\u00a0Is that true?\u00a0Wouldn't it be more accurate to\u00a0compare testing numbers by the\u00a0amount of tests administered per\u00a0million people?\u201d the viewer asked. Here's how Gupta answered: \"The answer is yes \u2026 You want to basically get a\u00a0large enough sample size for the\u00a0data to be meaningful.\u00a0And you know what? I don't care about other\u00a0countries, frankly.\u00a0We keep saying, but we're doing more\u00a0than other countries. It doesn't\u00a0matter.\u00a0That doesn't matter.\u00a0There are countries doing better\u00a0than us and there are countries doing\u00a0worse than us in terms of\u00a0testing.\u00a0What matters right now here is here.\u00a0And what we know is we need to be\u00a0doing way more testing than\u00a0we're doing.\u00a0Maybe a million or so tests a\u00a0day; I think we're around 150,\u00a0160,000 a day. And the reason you want to do\u00a0that much testing is you get a\u00a0better idea of where the virus\u00a0is, how it\u2019s spreading and how\u00a0to contain it.\" Gupta said the US has the \"strategies to be\u00a0able to contain this virus.\" \"This is a solvable problem.\u00a0I want to make this clear.\u00a0We have the strategies to be\u00a0able to contain this virus.\u00a0It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u00a0But we know how to do it,\" he added.

That means a vaccine would not be available until around March 2021. \"It's still the case that the estimate is March,\"\u00a0Hahn told CBS' Tony Dokoupil. \"But we're really trying to accelerate the efforts,\" Hahn said. \"And we will try for sooner.\" \u00a0 Coronavirus continues to spread in the US: As of this morning, there are more than 825,000 cases across the country, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. Lawmakers are working on financial relief for small businesses, health experts are warning of another outbreak wave, and the timeline of the spread of the virus in the US could be shifting. Here's where things stand this morning: The possible second wave: The CDC director warned there could be a second coronavirus outbreak this winter, and it could be \"even more difficult\" as it may run in conjunction with the flu season.\nWas coronavirus spreading in the US earlier? New autopsy results show\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0killed two Californians in early and mid-February \u2014 up to three weeks before\u00a0the previously known first US death from the virus. The development may change the understanding of how early the virus was spreading in the country, health experts said.\nAnother stimulus bill: The Senate passed $480 billion relief package yesterday, which includes hundreds of billions of dollars in new funding for small businesses. The bill now goes to the House for a vote.\nAbout hydroxychloroquine: Coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine, a treatment touted by President Trump, had higher deaths rates compared to those who did not take the drug, according to a study of hundreds of patients.\nTests give false negatives: Medical device company\u00a0Abbott\u00a0Laboratories\u00a0has warned\u00a0that its rapid coronavirus test can produce false negatives \u2013 where results suggest patients are not infected when in fact they are.\nTrump on testing: President\u00a0Trump, after a meeting with the New York governor, said that while states will control\u00a0testing, the federal government will work along with the state on the national manufacturers and distributors. The President has previously said testing \"is a local thing.\"\nNew York no longer needs hospital ship: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he told President Trump the US Navy Ship\u00a0Comfort \u2014deployed to New York City to serve as a hospital during the pandemic \u2014\u00a0is no longer needed. ##Stimulus## ##Testing## ##New York## Data suggests that people have dramatically reduced their time in public places and are largely staying at home \u2014 but easing social distancing restrictions could change the forecast, according to researchers.\u00a0 Lauren Ancel Meyers, who is leading researchers at the University of Texas-Austin, explained her team\u2019s model with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota.\u00a0 \u201cWe are using data from cell\u00a0phones...of tens\u00a0of millions of people that tell\u00a0us actually on a daily basis how much\u00a0time are people staying at\u00a0home, how often are they ending up in grocery\u00a0stores or in pharmacies or in other\u00a0places where they could have\u00a0contact that leads to disease\u00a0transmission,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Ancel Meyers said that Americans are largely staying at home and away from common places, which is why deaths are not continuing to skyrocket. \u201cThat is the secret to success.\u00a0That is why we have seen a\u00a0trailing off of mortality in\u00a0this country.\u00a0And that is why it's going to be\u00a0important going forward that we\u00a0continue to take measures to\u00a0prevent transmission by just\u00a0keeping out of contact with each\u00a0other or reducing the likelihood\u00a0of transmission when we do have to\u00a0come in contact with each other,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Ancel Meyers said her team\u2019s model builds on the one from IHME, which is frequently cited by the White House. Both models predict near-future coronavirus cases based on the current strict social distancing guidelines, but cases and deaths could increase again as state economies start reopening, she said. \u201cOne of the things we can't\u00a0predict at this point is how behavior is going\u00a0to change in the next week or\u00a0two or month or two.\u00a0To the extent that changes, the\u00a0forecasts may look very\u00a0different,\u201d she said.\u00a0 President Trump tweeted that states are \u201csafely coming back,\u201d this morning, days before Georgia\u2019s aggressive reopening plan begins and as his own health experts warn of a possible second wave of coronavirus infections.\u00a0 Some background: The President has been pressuring governors to reopen their states,\u00a0including sending tweets that seemed to encourage protests\u00a0in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, as Jeff Zeleny and Kaitlan Collins reported last week. Remember: A second coronavirus outbreak could emerge this winter in conjunction with the flu season to make for an even more dire health crisis, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0told The Washington Post in an interview. \"There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield said. \"And when I've said this to others, they kind of put their head back, they don't understand what I mean.\" Moments ago, Dr. Stephen Hahn, the US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, responded to Redfield's comments, saying, \"It's certainly a possibility\" there will be a second wave of coronavirus next winter.\u00a0 \u00a0##Reopening## Dr. Stephen Hahn, the US Food and Drug Administration's commissioner, said \"it's certainly a possibility\" there will be a second wave of coronavirus next winter.\u00a0 Appearing this morning on \"CBS This Morning,\" Hahn responded to remarks made by Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said the there could be a second, possibly worse coronavirus outbreak this winter. \"The whole task force set of doctors is concerned about the second wave,\" Hahn told CBS. \"That's why we have built into the plan the surveillance mechanisms to look for the respiratory illnesses and then to do the appropriate testing at that time.\"\u00a0 Hahn added surveillance and testing will be \"a critical part of the reopening plan to allow us to move forward.\"\u00a0 A section-by-section analysis of the relief package says that the $25 billion amount for testing will go toward \"necessary expenses to research, develop, validate, manufacture, purchase, administer and expand capacity for COVID-19 tests.\" Of the total amount dedicated to testing, there will be $11 billion given to states and localities \"to develop, purchase, administer, process and analyze COVID-19 tests.\" The rest of the money will be given to other entities, including federal agencies, to invest in promising new technologies and to distribute to labs. According to the analysis, the bill \"requires (a) strategic plan to related to providing assistance to states for testing and increasing testing capacity\" and it requires a plan for states and localities on how the money will be used for testing. This language had been a big sticking point in negotiations over a deal as President Trump has pushed for states to be responsible for expanding testing capacity while as Democrats had pushed for the federal government to take on a larger role in it. ##Stimulus## Two coronavirus-related deaths confirmed in Northern California's Santa Clara County\u00a0from early February are the earliest known deaths from the virus in the US. The deaths were from February 6 and February 17 -- up to three weeks before the first known US death in Kirkland, Washington, on February 29. A third death in early March was also confirmed to be virus-related, the statement said. \"Testing criteria set by the CDC at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms,\" a spokesperson for the county said. Further details on the victims were not provided. Read more here. The House\u00a0is expected to vote on a relief package that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in new funding for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus outbreak along with other priorities like money for hospitals and expanded Covid-19 testing. The Senate passed the relief package by a voice vote, meaning most senators would not need to return to Washington, DC, during the pandemic. The bill goes to the House, which is expected to vote on the package Thursday. The total price tag of the bill is approximately $484 billion. The full legislative text has not been formally released, but CNN obtained a copy of the bill, which runs 25 pages long. A section-by-section analysis obtained by CNN shows the deal will authorize the Paycheck Protection Program to spend an additional $310 billion.
