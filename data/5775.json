Normally $129.99, Amazon's true wireless earbuds are just $89.99 with free Prime shipping. The Echo Buds are true wireless earbuds that feature Alexa and noise reduction modes. There's also a custom app that helps you decide which one of the three ear tips is just right for you.  When it comes to battery life, these performed decently at up to five hours, or up to about 20 with the charging case in our testing. You won't be disappointed by the sound quality, either. They have a solid range, strong bass and crisp sound across most volumes. They also sport respectable noise-canceling capabilities and even a passthrough mode, so you can still hear the world around you without compromising your music. Of course, the flagship feature is Alexa. It takes seconds to sync your phone's Alexa App with the buds, and then you're good to go. From there, you can call upon her to your heart's content for playing music, making calls and all the rest.  You can see our thoughts in more detail in our Echo Buds review here. Simply put, Echo Buds are a strong value at $129.99, but at $89.99 they're even better.  Note: The prices above reflect the retailer's listed price at the time of publication."], "Language": false}
