A 20-year-old who recently traveled to Italy has tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Mexico -- bringing the national total to four cases, said Coahuila Governor\u00a0Miguel \u00c1ngel Riquelme on Saturday.\u00a0 The Mexican foreign ministry added that it had not received official word from Washington regarding possible transit restrictions over the US-Mexico border. \u201cThe Secretary\u00a0of Health implements mitigation measures, in accordance with those recommended by WHO and similar to those of countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom, staying alert at points of entry into the country, in order to inform and assist people who manifest symptoms related to COVID-19 and come from countries with local community transmission of this new disease,\" the ministry said. Hong Kong has confirmed one more case of the novel coronavirus, bringing the city-wide total to 95, according to a government statement.\u00a0 The case is associated with the Fook Wai Ching Buddhist temple cluster, the statement said. Numerous cases in the city have been linked to the temple.  The latest case is a 46-year-old woman, who is being treated in hospital. She is related to the 92nd confirmed case, and her family members are under quarantine.\u00a0 Among the 95 total confirmed cases, 60 remain in hospital. Another 33 have been discharged, and two patients have died.\u00a0 ##Asia## A fourth case of novel coronavirus was reported in Santa Clara County, California, according to the county's Public Health Department. The case involves an adult woman who was in contact with another coronavirus patient in the county, the department said in statement on Saturday. She is not ill or hospitalized and is isolated at home, the statement said. More on this: This means there are\u00a070\u00a0confirmed and presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus in the United States. A presumptive positive case has tested positive by a public health lab and is pending confirmation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These include 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and\u00a0three people repatriated from China, according to the CDC. With the new Santa Clara County case,\u00a0there are 23 US cases in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington state and Wisconsin. Thirteen of these cases are travel-related and 10 are linked to person-to-person spread. Cases are cumulative from January 21. Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced the country\u2019s second confirmed case of the novel coronavirus on Saturday. The patient had been in Italy and traveled from Milan to Sao Paulo on Feb. 27, according to the ministry, which added that \u201cthere are no elements that indicate that the virus has circulated in the country.\u201d ##Americas## A man in the eastern part of Ireland has contracted coronavirus, according to a statement from Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team, Saturday. The case is associated with travel from an affected area in Northern Italy. ##Italy## There are now\u00a069\u00a0confirmed and presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus in the United States,\u00a0according to an update Saturday by the US Centers for Disease Control and\u00a0Prevention. These include 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship,\u00a0three people repatriated from China and 22 US cases, according to CDC.

Thirteen of these cases are travel-related and nine are linked to person-to-person spread, according to the CDC. Cases are cumulative from January 21 through Saturday. ##United States## US health officials told reporters Saturday that reinfection with the novel coronavirus is unlikely. \"We have not seen any sign yet of the phenomenon\" of reinfection, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Messonnier suggested any reports suggesting otherwise may be indicative of doctors and scientists jumping the gun, skirting around proper scientific review. \"It is really important for the global community to get access to scientific information as quickly as possible and in real time,\" she said. \" But in the rush to push out information quickly, there have been some instances already where there hasn't been appropriate\u00a0scientific review of some of the data that's coming out. And that is an essential part of any investigation.\" She said the CDC has been following US cases closely, including \"whether or not they continue to harbor the virus in their nose and throat.\" Thus far, reinfection is \"not something that we're seeing here, and it has not changed our clinical practice,\" she said. Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made similar comments earlier Saturday at a White House briefing. \"There's no indication that that's going on at all. If this virus acts like other viruses \u2014 which I have no reason to believe it won't \u2014 once you've gotten\u00a0infected and recovered, you're not going to get infected with the same virus,\" Fauci said. ##United States## Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tweeted that the agency gave incorrect information about the Washington coronavirus patient who died to President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday. \u201cCDC erroneously identified the patient as a female in a briefing earlier today with the President and Vice President,\u201d Redfield tweeted from the verified Twitter account @CDCDirector. The patient who died was a man in his 50s in Washington state. This was the first death from the novel coronavirus in the United States. Trump and other officials, including Redfield, identified the patient as a woman in her 50s during a press briefing on Saturday. A Seattle and King County health official later said the patient was a man. ##United States## More than 50 residents and staff from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, will be tested for the novel coronavirus because they\u2019re experiencing symptoms,\u00a0said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington. Duchin said there are \"approximately 108 residents at the facility and about 180 staff. And among the residents, we've had reports that approximately 27 have some sort of symptoms and among the staff, approximately 25. We're going to be working in collaboration with a CDC team, which will be arriving tonight, to assess each and every one of these people and provide the appropriate guidance around isolating. And all of these people will be tested, and we'll take every step to minimize any potential for exposure of others. But at this point the investigation is just getting started.\" So far, there are two cases of the virus linked to the skilled nursing facility, Duchin said during a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention briefing on Saturday.  More on the cases: One case is in a health care worker, a woman in her 40s who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition. She had no relevant history of travel. The other case is a woman in her 70s who was a resident of the center. She is in serious condition in another hospital.\u00a0 ##United States## One in 10 confirmed coronavirus cases in Lombardy \u2013 the northern Italian region at the center of the country's outbreak \u2013 involve medical personnel, according to Paola Stringa, a spokesperson for Lombardy regional government. Giulio Gallera, the welfare assessor in charge of regional healthcare in Lombardy, told reporters on Saturday that the Lombardy region is evaluating and following the advice of the World Health Organization, and deciding whether to dedicate an entire Hospital to coronavirus patients.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s important to preserve the well-being of medical personnel, which today represents the 10% of the infected,\u201d Gallera said.\u00a0 \u00a0##Europe## Asked about why President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence described the Washington patient who died from the novel coronavirus as a woman when in reality the patient was a man, a senior administration official placed the blame on the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cDr. (Robert) Redfield briefed the VP and POTUS after speaking with Washington State health officials that it was a woman. Washington State has since corrected,\" the official said. CNN Health is reaching out to the CDC for reaction. ##United States## The Washington patient who died from the novel coronavirus was a man in his 50s, Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington, said during a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention news conference on Saturday. This is the first death linked to the novel coronavirus in the United States.\u00a0 Duchin said county health officials were made aware of the case on Friday. The patient had underlying health conditions. \u201cIt was a male,\u201d Duchin said. \u201cThis case was reported to us yesterday from the Washington State Public Health Laboratories as a presumptive positive, confirmation pending.\u201d\u00a0 President Trump and other health officials speaking at a White House press conference on Saturday said the person who died was a woman. ##United States## Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued a state of emergency in response to the new cases of coronavirus that were announced in the state late Friday night. \u201cThis is a time to take common-sense, proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of those who live in Washington state. Our state agency directors have been actively preparing since the nation\u2019s first case appeared in Snohomish County. Washingtonians can be assured we\u2019ve taken this threat seriously and have been working in collaboration with our health care partners to develop plans and procedures to prepare for what could likely be a world-wide pandemic,\u201d Inslee said. The proclamation directs state agencies and departments to utilize state resources and do everything necessary to assist affected communities responding to and recovering from coronavirus, according to the emergency order. President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar say Americans should not panic in the wake of the first US death from coronavirus. They noted that additional cases of coronavirus in the US are likely but that, for the average American, the risk is low.  \"Healthy individuals should be able to fully recover, and we think that will be a statement that we can make with great surety now that we've gotten familiar with this problem,\" Trump said. Azar added: \u201cIt's important to remember,\u00a0for the vast majority of\u00a0individuals who contract the\u00a0novel coronavirus, they will\u00a0experience mild to moderate\u00a0symptoms, and their treatment\u00a0will be to remain at home,\u00a0treating their symptoms, the way\u00a0they would a severe cold, or the\u00a0flu.\u201d ##United States## The Washington woman who died from the novel coronavirus appears to have become ill through community spread, says Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThe investigation at this time shows no evidence of link to travel or a known contact,\u201d Redfield told reporters at the White House on Saturday. Trump said there are now 22 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States. That number does not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those cases have been counted separately by the CDC. More from Washington:\u00a0There are three new novel coronavirus cases in people who tested presumptive positive in Washington, health officials said during a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention news briefing on Saturday. This includes the first reported death, as well as the first reported case in a US health care worker and the first reported outbreak in a skilled nursing facility, according to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\u00a0 Two cases are associated with Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington. One case is in a health care worker, a woman in her 40s who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition. She had no relevant history of travel. The other case is a woman in her 70s who was a resident of the center. She is in serious condition in another hospital. The death was not associated with a long-term care facility. ##United States## Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg will speak about the coronavirus in a taped address on Sunday night. \u00a0 The taped address, entitled \"Leadership In Crisis,\" will air during commercial airtime on CBS and NBC at approximately 8:30 p.m. ET.\u00a0 Here are the full remarks he will deliver: Good evening. I know this has been a very worrisome week for many Americans. The Coronavirus is spreading, and the economy is taking a hit. Markets have fallen because of uncertainty. At times like this it is the job of the President to reassure the public that he or she is taking all the necessary steps to protect the health and well-being of every citizen.\u00a0 The public wants to know their leader is trained, informed and respected. When a problem arises, they want someone in charge who can marshal facts and expertise to confront the problem. They want him or her to prepare for events like these in advance with teams of experts. Communications must be honest and transparent, so people can be confident that professionals are in charge. Trust is essential. Government\u2019s resources must be focused and priorities clear and consistent. Presidents have vast tools at their disposal \u2014 and they must be used effectively and decisively. This includes building strong, cooperative relationships with nations around the world to prevent and prepare for pandemics and other global emergencies that cross borders. The Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health must be given all of the resources necessary to do their job free of political interference. Decisions must be based on data and must empower the doctors and scientists whose job it is to keep us safe.\u00a0 As the former mayor of New York City, I know it is critical that the federal government work in close partnership with state and local leaders who administer services and deploy first responders. That requires putting politics and partisanship aside. I was first elected just weeks after the attack on 9/11 \u2014 a massive rebuilding, security and health challenge. In my 12 years in office I dealt with a hurricane, a blackout, attempted terror attacks, the West Nile virus and swine flu. My method of leadership was to plan ahead before the problem arrived \u2013 we worked with hospitals and first responders to develop plans in advance, to improve communication and to invest in preparedness.\u00a0 Through the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins, I understood the challenges hospitals and medical professionals face and we worked as a team to upgrade readiness.\u00a0 Each crisis is different, but they all require steady leadership, team building and preparation. As Americans we have faced many challenges before, and we have overcome them together by looking out for one another \u2014 and I am confident that is how we will get through this one as well. I\u2019m Mike Bloomberg and I approve this message. ##United States## President Trump says his use of the word \"hoax\" does not refer to the coronavirus itself but to criticism of his administration's handling of the crisis.  Asked if he regretted calling the virus spread a hoax during a rally in South Carolina Friday night, Trump insisted that he didn\u2019t. \u00a0\u201cHoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody,\u201d Trump said of administration critics. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here, I\u2019m talking about what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Trump said the criticism was a \u201ccontinuation of the hoax,\u201d and mentioned the Russia investigation and his impeachment. He then said he doesn\u2019t like when his officials on the virus response are criticized. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when they are criticizing these people and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hoax I\u2019m talking about.\u201d More on this: The President said at the rally in South Carolina Friday that Democrats are now \"politicizing\" the virus. \"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,\" Trump said. \"They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.\" \"This is their new hoax,\" Trump added. ##United States## President Trump said Saturday the administration was considering additional travel restrictions to deal with coronavirus.\u00a0 Asked if he was considering closing the southern border due to coronavirus, Trump said \u201cyes\u201d and later said \u201cvery strongly.\u201d Later, he seemed to indicate he was walking it back. \u201cWe are looking also at the southern border. In fact, some of the folks are here right now, Ken (Cuccinelli) is here some place, and yes, we are thinking about the southern border,\u201d the President said. \u201cWe have received a lot of power over the southern border over the last couple of years from the courts but we are looking at that very strongly.\u201d When confronted with the fact that Mexico has far fewer cases than the US, Trump seemed to contradict himself. \u201cWe're not talking about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to think all borders, we have to think about, as it pertain to what we're talking about here, this is not a border that seems to be much of a problem right now. We hope we won't have to do that.\u201d \u00a0##United States## The coronavirus patient who died in Washington state went to the hospital \"with serious respiratory issues,\" according to an EvergreenHealth Medical Center statement. EvergreenHealth received two patients who tested positive for Covid-19. the statement says. The surviving patient \"remains in isolation and continues to receive appropriate treatment,\" according to the statement.\u00a0\u00a0 Mark Senis of Life Care Center of Kirkland told CNN they currently don't have Covid-19 patients in their facility but they did at one point, and later transferred that patient to EvergreenHealth. It's not clear which patient that was. ##United States## Vice President Mike Pence announced new travel restrictions Saturday in response to the spread of coronavirus. Pence announced more restrictions on travel from Iran. The administration is \u201cexpanding existing\u00a0travel restrictions to include\u00a0any foreign national who has\u00a0visited Iran within the last 14\u00a0days,\u201d the vice president said. Pence said the administration, through the US State Department, would increase the travel advisory for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level, advising American not to travel to specific regions in those countries. \u201cWe are urging Americans to not\u00a0travel to the areas in Italy and\u00a0the areas in South Korea that\u00a0are most affected by the\u00a0coronavirus,\u201d Pence said. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the goal is to lower the travel to and from the most impacted areas in an attempt to control the spread of the virus. SEE PENCE'S REMARKS: ##United States## The first US coronavirus fatality was a \"medically high-risk patient in her late 50s,\" President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday.  \"She was a wonderful woman,\u201d he said.  Earlier, Washington Gov. Jan Inslee referred to the patient as male. CNN has reached out to Inslee's office for clarification. Trump discussed the latest novel coronavirus developments after a briefing from his coronavirus task force earlier in the day. Less than an hour before Trump's news conference, Washington state officials confirmed the death. WATCH HERE: ##United States## The number of coronavirus cases in Italy climbed by 307 on Saturday, with 1,128 diagnoses of the virus confirmed, civil protection officials say. Fifty-two percent of the cases are in house isolation, said the head of the Civil Protection Department, Angelo Borrelli. Another 101 people are in intensive care units, and 401 people are hospitalized with mild symptoms. A total of 18,500 samples have been taken in Italy.

Of the eight dead on Saturday, all were elderly -- six were in Lombardy and two in Emilia Romagna. Twenty-nine people in all have died in Italy. ##Europe## Gov. Jay Inslee's statement confirming death of a Washington state man from the coronavirus: \"It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"In partnership with the Washington State Department of Health, the Washington State Department of Emergency Management and local and community health partners, we are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts. I am committed to keeping Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.\" ##United States## One person with coronavirus residing in King County, Washington, has died, says state Health Department spokesperson Jamie Nixon.  No further details were provided. A news conference is set for 1 p.m. local time. ##United States## Iraq reports five new positive cases of coronavirus, the Health Ministry says. That brings the country's total to 13.  Four new cases were in Baghdad and one in Babil Province, south of the capital,\u00a0according to a statement Friday from the Iraqi Health Ministry. The five new patients are under quarantine.\u00a0 ##Middle East## Nine new cases of novel coronavirus were confirmed Saturday by Japan's Health Ministry, bringing the total number of cases nationwide to 944.\u00a0 One recent case includes a man in his 70s who was a Diamond Princess cruise ship passenger.

Here's the breakdown: The cases include 239 people on land and 705 from the Diamond Princess, the health ministry says. At least 11 deaths -- six from the Diamond Princess and five on land -- have been attributed to the virus, according Japanese health officials. ##Asia## The US Food and Drug Administration announced on Saturday a policy allowing certain US labs to test for the novel coronavirus using diagnostics the labs developed and validated, even before the agency has reviewed them. The policy will enable more rapid testing capacity, the agency says. \u201cWe believe this policy strikes the right balance during this public health emergency,\u201d FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to help to ensure sound science prior to clinical testing and follow-up with the critical independent review from the FDA, while quickly expanding testing capabilities in the US.\u201d The guidance goes into effect immediately: Once labs have validated a test, they must notify the FDA and should submit a request for an emergency use authorization within 15 business days. This policy applies only to labs certified to perform high-complexity testing. Local and state labs\u2019 ability to test for the novel coronavirus was delayed because test kits previously developed by the US Centers for Disease Control were flawed.  The CDC said Friday that US labs were able to start testing for coronavirus using revised instructions for kits previously sent out. CDC also has manufactured brand new test kits that are available for order.

The health authorities added that they will distribute 100,000 face masks daily \u2013 three per person. ##Asia## The Australian government is warning citizens not to travel to Iran -- one of the hardest hit countries in the coronavirus outbreak. The government has increased its warning level to \"do not travel,\" with the government travel advice website Smart Traveller warning that Iran will struggle to cope with a large outbreak. Iran has reported 388 cases and 34 deaths, but there is concern that the numbers could be higher.  Australia's Chief Medical Officer has advised that there is a high level of concern about widespread community transmission of the coronavirus in Iran.  Here's what the Smart Traveller website says: There have been many deaths. The health care system will likely struggle to cope with a large outbreak. Airlines are reducing or stopping flights into and out of Iran. Medical evacuation is not likely to be possible.\" Starting from Sunday, March 1, Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family who are traveling from Iran to Australia will need to self isolate for 14 days. Japan's cherry blossoms are a huge tourist draw -- and a source of national pride.  But this year, at least two cherry blossom festivals won't be going ahead. The Osaka Mint cherry blossom festival in Japan has been cancelled over coronavirus outbreak concerns, according to a statement from the organizers.\u00a0 In Tokyo, the Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival also announced it would cancel its event this year, including its main attraction of lighting up trees along the river.\u00a0 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is donating cash to help support the fight against coronavirus. The stock exchange is donating HK$10 million (US$1.28 million), the listed company said in a tweet on Saturday.\u00a0 The donation will be allocated to several welfare organizations that \u201cprovide relief and support to those in need.\u201d HKEX did not specify which organizations the funds will be donated to, or provide a timeline for the distribution.  President Donald Trump\u00a0is hoping for a \"miracle\" that\u00a0will make the coronavirus disappear. But\u00a0tanking stock markets\u00a0and signs\u00a0the disease is stalking America\u00a0are delivering their verdict on his scattershot management of the crisis. A historic Wall Street sell off, the first case on US soil that could not be traced to travel to countries battling the virus, and news of drug shortages outpaced White House efforts to show everything was under control. \"It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear,\" Trump said at the White House Thursday as the virus marched across Asia and Europe after US officials said the US should brace for severe disruption to everyday life. The President also warned that things could \"get worse before it gets better,\" but he added it could \"maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows.\" The President's comments, which seemed divorced from the gravity of the situation, followed\u00a0CNN reporting that raised new questions about Trump's capacity to handle the crisis. For weeks, aides and allies have tried to impress upon him the seriousness of the coronavirus situation, warning him of the threat to the global economy and -- by proxy -- his own reelection prospects, according to people familiar with the conversations. Devastating losses in Wall Street that finally convinced him to put a face on the crisis on Wednesday. But his erratic news conference only fanned the impression of a leadership vacuum.

At least 11 people have died from the virus in the country, according to Japanese health officials. Of the 935 cases, 705 are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama. The American-owned cruise ship was put under quarantine by Japanese authorities for two weeks in February after a coronavirus outbreak was detected on board. Six people from the ship have died from coronavirus.  Last week, a top Japanese government adviser admitted that the quarantine measures enacted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship may have allowed additional infections to spread among the ship's crew and passengers. But by failing to isolate the crew of the Diamond Princess from the beginning of the quarantine, infected workers may have passed on \"secondary or tertiary\" infections to their fellow crew members and passengers, thereby exacerbating the deadly outbreak, according to Dr. Norio Ohmagari, the director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center at the government-funded National Center for Global Health and Medicine. Read more about the Diamond Princess cruise ship here.  Hakone is a resort town in Japan just outside of Tokyo -- and normally at this time of the year, it would be bustling with visitors. It's a place with hot springs and mountain views. But as Japan tried to battle the coronavirus outbreak that's infected more than 900 people in the country alone, the town is eerily quiet. Hotels, restaurants and tourist sites are unusually empty, with few foreign visitors in sight.  Hear more about what the town is like from CNN correspondent Will Ripley: Over half of all confirmed cases in South Korea are connected to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji religious group, according to South Korean authorities. In total, 1,557 cases -- or 53.1% of South Korea's total cases -- are connected to the group. The vast majority of those are in the city of Daegu.  There are 2,931 total coronavirus cases in South Korea, and 2,055 of them in Daegu. Of the cases in Daegu, 1,356 are connected with the group.  What is the Shincheonji religious group? Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony was established on March 14, 1984, by Lee and is centered around the personality of its founder. Little is known about his past. The group -- which is an offshoot of Christianity -- says it has about 245,000 members more than 31,000 of them from overseas. Why would the virus have spread through the group? According to former member Duhyen Kim, attendance at services was mandatory. Members need to swipe in and out of services with a special card, and any absence was followed up on. Sickness was not a reason to miss services. He describes how, when he was a member, followers would sit on the floor during hours-long services \"packed together like sardines.\" And according to Kim, attendees are not allowed to wear anything on their faces -- even glasses -- during prayer time. How has the group handled the outbreak? There's been heavy criticism of the group's level of transparency. South Korea's Gyeonggi provincial governor, Lee Jae-myung, said in a radio interview with Korean station TBS, that the Shincheonji group had not initially cooperated with officials as promised.  Daegu police deployed 600 officers to find hundreds of members, knocking on doors, tracking phones and scouring security camera footage to find them, and asking them to self-isolate. Members of the public signed an online petition filed to the president's office calling for Shincheonji to be dissolved.  But Shincheonji says it has close to 1,100 buildings and is disinfecting them to try to stem the spread of the virus. It also says it is cooperating with local authorities, and has shut down all church services and gatherings. Read more about how the virus spread through the group here.  Taiwan confirmed five additional coronavirus cases on Saturday, raising the total tally to 38, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The cases include a cleaner and three medical staff who had contact with a person before they tested positive for coronavirus. The four all developed a cough, runny nose and fever between February 18 to 25, the statement said.  Authorities have shut down the room the previous case stayed in before testing positive. The fifth new case is a woman in her 60s. She toured Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt from January 29 to February 21, and developed a sore throat and cough on February 20.  The UAE has 19 confirmed cases, while Egypt has one confirmed case. An Icelandic man in his 40s who recently traveled to Italy has been infected with the coronavirus, according to Icelandic authorities. The man traveled to Northern Italy -- where most of the coronavirus cases are centered -- but he didn't go to what authorities have termed the \"designated risk zone,\" according to Iceland\u2019s Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management.\u00a0 He's now in isolation at Landspitali National University Hospital in the country's capital, Reykjavik. He is not considered severely ill but is showing common symptoms of the virus. The government is working to trace the man\u2019s path to see who else may be at risk of exposure.\u00a0 In a striking contradiction to White House assertions that the coronavirus is under control, the Pentagon's chief of personnel is sharply warning that the virus poses an increased \"threat\" in areas where US troops and defense personnel are located around the globe.\u00a0\u00a0 In a February 25 memo, Matthew Donovan, who is filling the top personnel job on a temporary basis, informed the military's most senior leaders that as the novel coronavirus continues to spread, it is \"an increasing force health protection (FHP) threat in areas where Department of Defense (DoD) personnel live and work.\" CNN has learned that top US commanders around the globe are increasingly concerned that as allies shut down borders and travel in response to the virus' spread, there's a risk that by the end of March, US military readiness may start degrading, according to several defense officials. The military leaders' concerns and Donovan's memo are the latest signs that the virus is becoming a national security challenge. It is affecting the military, curtailing diplomats' movements, straining global supply chains and shaking the US economy, which saw stock markets drop more in the past week than they have since the economic crisis of 2008.

Macao has imposed a compulsory quarantine on people who have traveled to Italy or Iran in the past 14 days before entry from Saturday noon local time, according to a government statement. The travelers will have to undergo medical observation in isolation for 14 days at a designated venue in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\u00a0 Macao residents can stay at a domestic venue approved by the health authorities, while non-Macao residents will be placed at a designated hotel at their own expense. Separately, the city\u2019s public services will resume on Monday, after government departments provided only basic or emergency services, according to a government report. North Korean leader\u00a0Kim\u00a0Jong\u00a0Un\u00a0announced steps to prevent coronavirus from spreading into North Korea during a meeting with his Workers' Party of Korea Saturday, according to state-run\u00a0KCNA.\u00a0 \"In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,\" KNCA reported Kim as saying,\u00a0\"noting that the strong measures taken by our Party and the government from the beginning have been the surest and highly reliable, preemptive and decisive preventive measures as this viral infection spreads so rapidly, its incubation period is\u00a0uncertain and its contagion route is also scientifically\u00a0uncertain.\" North Korea has not confirmed a single case of the virus\u00a0inside its borders, but global health experts have warned the country is highly susceptible to an outbreak given its close proximity to China and limited medical capabilities. Every other country in East Asia has confirmed numerous cases. On Thursday, a United Nations sanctions committee announced it had given approval for diagnostic equipment to enter North Korea to combat a potential outbreak. A high school student who has no history of traveling to infected areas has been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to Washington State Department of Health.\u00a0 The student is one of two new presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus in the state of Washington.\u00a0The second presumptive case is a female in her 50's from Snohomish County who recently traveled to South Korea.\u00a0 Presumptively positive means the tests have come back positive from the public health laboratory in Washington and are pending confirmation at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0 The boy -- who is a high school student in Washington state -- visited two different clinics in Snohomish County this week, according to Snohomish\u00a0Health District interim health officer Dr. Chris Spitters.\u00a0 The student planned to go to school on Friday morning, but was notified of his test results and returned home before attending any classes.  The boy's school, Jackson High School, will be closed on Monday for three days to allow for deep cleaning.  The student who tested positive is currently in home isolation and doing well.\u00a0A small number of students that\u00a0came into close contact with the student were notified by\u00a0local health officials, and will stay home for the next 14 days. Health\u00a0officials\u00a0are also\u00a0working to notify any health care workers and patients that may have come into contact with the student. The boy's sibling, who attends Gateway Middle School, is being tested and will remain out of school in quarantine until his test results are back, according to a letter to families from Everett Public Schools, which runs Jackson High School. According to the letter, the sibling is not currently symptomatic. For 18-year-old Huang Yiyang, school starts when she opens up her laptop. Over the past two weeks, there have been no school bells, bustling corridors, busy canteens or uniforms. Instead of physically traveling to her public school in Shanghai, Huang sits at her laptop from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. often in her pajamas, watching\u00a0livestreamed\u00a0class after livestreamed class. For physical education class, her teacher performs exercises for students to follow. For English, she sits silently through lectures to virtual classrooms of 20 to 30 students. She puts stickers or tissues over her webcam, so\u00a0her classmates can't see her if a teacher calls on her to answer a question. \"We're at home, so we don't look so good,\" she says. Huang barely leaves the house, and she hasn't seen her friends for a month. But while she is isolated, she's also part of what may be the world's largest remote learning experiment. In a bid to stop the spread of the disease, schools across China are closed, leaving about\u00a0180 million\u00a0school-aged children stuck at home. And mainland China is just the start. Millions of students in Hong Kong, Macao, Vietnam, Mongolia, Japan, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq and Italy have been affected by school closures. For some, that means missing class altogether, while others are trialing online learning. Authorities in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom have indicated that, if the outbreak gets worse, they could shut schools, too. But while online learning is allowing children to keep up their education in the time of the coronavirus, it's also come with a raft of other problems. For some students, the issues are minor -- shaky internet connections or trouble staying motivated. For others, the remote learning experiment could come at a cost of their mental health -- or even their academic future. Read more about the world's largest remote learning experiment here.  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Friday called the coronavirus a \"pandemic,\" using a term that has not been used by the White House or government health agencies as the Trump administration struggles to stay on message in response to the virus' outbreak. \"Hopefully we can get past this coronavirus pandemic very quickly and get back to the trade,\" Perdue said while speaking to farmers at the Commodity Classic conference in San Antonio, according to audio of his remarks obtained by CNN. The secretary's use of the word is out of sync with the official message from the Trump administration, which has sought to downplay fears of a pandemic. Global health officials have not labeled the virus' outbreak a pandemic, either. All public messaging on the coronavirus is supposed to be cleared by Vice President Mike Pence's office, an attempt to get the Trump administration on the same page after administration officials blamed a series of mixed messages from senior officials earlier in the week for critical media coverage. Pence is leading the administration's efforts to combat the coronavirus. The basis for Perdue's use of the term is unclear.\u00a0 CNN has reached out to the Department of Agriculture for clarification but has not yet heard back. The White House is declining to comment. Read the full story here. Over the past week, the coronavirus outbreak has shaken stock markets and prompted concern from US politicians. The country has 64 confirmed cases and no deaths -- still relatively small numbers compared to mainland China, where 79,251 people have been infected, and other more recent hotspots, such as South Korea, Iran and Italy, where outbreaks are expanding rapidly.  But concern over coronavirus is certainly leaving its mark.  Preparation concerns After a briefing Friday, Democrats said that the country is not prepared to deal with the public health threat, while Republicans were less critical but still said that more needs to be done to combat the spread of the disease. \"This is potentially an enormous issue for the country and I do not think we're prepared,\" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic Judiciary Committee member, said. Panicked markets The three major stock indexes posted their worst weekly percentage drops since the 2008 financial crisis. Trillions of dollars have been wiped out of the stock market in a week. Spiking demand for hand sanitizer US drug stores, retailers and suppliers are racing to keep up with surging interest for cleaning products as\u00a0fears over coronavirus\u00a0intensify. Pharmacy CVS has warned that the demand for those products could cause supply shortages.   Cancellations The fears are also impacting the entertainment industry. Production for the upcoming season of hit show \"The Amazing Race\" has been temporarily suspended, and California punk rockers Green Day suspended concerts in Asia over the virus.  Community spread Several people are believed to have become infected despite not traveling to an infected area, or having come into contact with a person known to be infected with the virus.  Less obvious impacts Companies such as footwear manufacturer Crocs, which has a large retail presence and consumer base in Asia, have been hit hard. In the case of Crocs, the company relies solely on non-US third party manufacturers, and says it expects a considerable sales hit this year because of the coronavirus. There are already more than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the South Korean city of Daegu -- but South Korea\u2019s Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip warned that number will continue to rise. In a daily briefing Saturday, Kim said the confirmed cases would rise as tests on the Shincheonji religious group members continue.\u00a0 The religious group is now at the heart of South Korea's\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0outbreak, particularly in the city of Daegu. In total, South Korea has 2,931 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 2,055 of them in Daegu.  \u201cThe proportion of confirmed cases among them (Shincheonji religious group) is considerably high. As a result, over the next few days when tests on the Shincheonji religious group are being completed, confirmed cases in Daegu are expected to continue to rise at a substantial level,\u201d Kim said.\u00a0 He also said that this weekend will be a crucial moment in preventing additional spread of the virus and\u00a0urged citizens to avoid going to events where many people gather in enclosed spaces. Canada has 16 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The latest case is an 80-year-old man with a travel history to Egypt, according to a statement from Dr David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health. Egypt only has one reported coronavirus case. The man arrived in Toronto on February 20, and went to the Scarborough Health Network\u2019s emergency hospital on February 27.  The patient was cared for at the hospital and was tested and isolated while there. He was discharged home the same day and went into self-isolation, where he remains. Most of Canada's cases are in British Columbia or Ontario, with one case in Quebec.  A University of California Davis student is being tested for coronavirus following potential exposure, Dr. Cindy Schorzman announced in a press call. That person is being isolated at home, and two other students are being isolated off campus as well, Schorzman said. All three are roommates at a UC Davis residence hall, according to Schorzman. Test results for the student under investigation are not expected for a few days, as the nasal and orals swabs were sent to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, which is processing hundreds of tests from around the country, Yolo County health officer Dr. Ron Chapman said. The other two students are asymptomatic. Citing privacy laws, health officials would not say whether the student was potentially exposed to someone with the virus or if they had recently traveled to a suspect location. A Solano County woman is being treated at UC Davis Medical Center for what might be the first \u2018community spread\u2019 case of coronavirus. The UC Davis Medical Center is not on campus, but is about 17-miles away in Sacramento. At the start of February, mainland Chinese authorities were reporting over 1,000 new coronavirus cases each day. This week, confirmed new coronavirus cases increased by the hundreds.  On Friday, for instance, there were 427 new confirmed cases, with almost all of them in Hubei province where the outbreak is believed to have started, according to China\u2019s\u00a0National\u00a0Health\u00a0Commission. Since the start of the outbreak, 79,251 have been infected with coronavirus and 39,002\u00a0patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, the commission said. The recent numbers suggest that the outbreak may be stabilizing on the mainland. That's how state media China Daily is presenting it -- in a report Saturday, the paper ran the headline: \"Epidemic easing at its epicenter.\" How China is reacting to the drop in numbers Some parts of China have lowered travel restrictions and began the slow process of getting back to work. Liaoning, a province in northeastern China that borders North Korea, was the first to\u00a0downgrade the coronavirus emergency response\u00a0level from the highest level -- Level 1 -- to Level 3 on Saturday, according to a statement by the provincial government.  This was followed by Shanxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Gansu and Guizhou, accounting for some 305 million people. Why that could be an issue The problem is, the danger may be far from over. Outside of the epicenter in Hubei province, where a huge amount of resources and emergency staff have been deployed, there are fears that cases may have been missed or gone undiagnosed. Similarly, it may be weeks before it is safe for people to begin moving around freely again or gathering in large numbers. We know that the virus can lie dormant and there is strong evidence that it is spread while people are asymptomatic. Read more about how China is handling the outbreak here.  Chinese manufacturing activity slowed at record pace in February, confirming the impact of the novel coronavirus on the world\u2019s second largest economy. The official\u00a0manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) was 35.7 in February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Saturday. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. This is the lowest reading since January\u00a02005 when it was first released. The second lowest was 38.8 in November 2008, during the global financial crisis.\u00a0 Since the outbreak began in December last year, more than 78,000 cases have been confirmed inside of Mainland China, with the death toll rising to more than 2,700.\u00a0 China's leaders have taken dramatic steps to rein in the virus, quarantining millions of people and putting much of the country on lockdown. Over 120 health care workers from one hospital in California have been asked to stay home over fears they may have been exposed to a coronavirus patient. A woman is currently being treated at\u00a0the University of California\u00a0Davis\u00a0Medical Center for confirmed case of COVID-19. The patient didn't have any relevant travel history or any exposure to another known patient. A total of 124 health care workers -- including at least 36 nurses -- have been forced to self-quarantine after possible exposure to the coronavirus patient, the\u00a0National Nurses United union announced Friday.  The health care workers have been asked to stay home, according to a press release from the union. \"Despite University of California medical facilities being generally better prepared and equipped to treat challenging medical cases, the recent UC Davis Medical Center COVID-19 case highlights the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s hospitals to this virus and the insufficiency of current Centers for Disease Control guidelines,\" the union said in the press release. A spokesman at UC Davis Health tells CNN they do not have a comment at this time.\u00a0 The spouse of the United States Forces Korea service member who recently tested positive for coronavirus has also tested positive. The patient is the fourth\u00a0USFK-related person who has been confirmed with the virus. In a statement, the United States Forces Command\u00a0said that the woman has been in self-quarantine since February 26 following her husband's positive test \"She is currently being transported to a US military hospital where she'll be in isolation under direct medical care and supervision from US military medical providers. \nThe patient has not been in contact with any other USFK or USFK affiliated personnel since going into quarantine, and KCDC (Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and USFK health professionals determined contact tracing was not necessary due to her quarantine measures and lack of interaction with others.\" US Forces Korea announced Wednesday that a US service member stationed in South Korea tested positive for the virus. The 23-year-old soldier, stationed at Camp Carroll which is approximately 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the city of Daegu, was the first US service member to test positive for the novel coronavirus. A South\u00a0Korean employee at Camp Carroll and his wife have also tested positive and are now receiving treatment.  Following the outbreak, US Forces Korea has moved to implement measures to stop the potential spread.  The US and\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0agreed to postpone\u00a0joint military\u00a0drills Thursday, and approximately 70 additional US military medical personnel will be deployed to US installations in South Korea.  South Korea now has 2,931 confirmed coronavirus cases, after reporting an additional 594 cases overnight, the\u00a0South\u00a0Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement Saturday. Three new deaths were reported on Saturday, bringing the country wide death toll at 16. All three new deaths occurred in the Daegu region, and the deceased are identified as women born in 1926, 1950, and 1957. South Korea has the highest number of confirmed cases of any country besides mainland China, where a total of 79,251 have been infected. The death toll in China is 2,835. A person in Oregon diagnosed with a presumptive case of the novel coronavirus had no known travel exposure and is believed to have contracted the disease through the community, according to Oregon Health Authority Director Pat Allen. A presumptive case means that a test at a state, county or city lab shows that someone has tested positive for coronavirus, but that result has not yet been confirmed by the CDC\u2019s lab in Atlanta. This case is the third in the US where the person is believed to have contracted the disease through the community -- meaning they haven't traveled to an infected area or had contact with a person known to be infected with the virus.  \u201cThere was no known travel exposure for this individual, so this is a case of community spread of the disease, much like the case from California earlier this week,\u201d Allen said. The person is from Washington County and is being treated at a Kaiser Permanente hospital. The patient spent time at the Forest Hills Elementary School in Lake Oswego School District and the Oregon Health Authority is working with school officials and the Oregon Department of Education in the response, Allen said.\u00a0 The case tested positive for coronavirus in Oregon, but the results need to be confirmed by the CDC in Atlanta, Allen said.\u00a0\u00a0 The first case of \"community spread\" occurred in California. The person did not have any relevant travel history or known\u00a0contact with another infected person. Malaysia has confirmed two new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total tally up to 25 on Friday, according to a report from state media Bernama. The two new cases are a 41-year-old female Japanese citizen and a 54-year-old male Italian national.\u00a0 The woman traveled to Japan in January and to Indonesia in early February. She developed a fever on February 17. The man traveled to Italy from Februray 15 to 21, and started having a fever, cough, and joint and body pains on Februray 22.\u00a0 The country has imposed restrictions on travelers from the South Korean cities of Daegu and Cheongdo -- current virus hotspots, according to the report. Malaysian nationals, permanent residents and students returning to Malaysia from these two locations will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\u00a0 The Australian Department of Health has confirmed that 25 people have been infected with coronavirus -- up on the previous 22 cases. Of those 25, 15 people have reportedly recovered and the rest are in stable condition.  Nine cases are associated with the repatriation flight to bring passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship home from Japan, according to the country's health department.  President Donald Trump's meeting with Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) leaders has been postponed, a senior administration official told CNN.  The meeting was due to take place in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 14, but was postponed Friday.  As the international community works together to defeat the novel coronavirus, the United States, in consultation with ASEAN partners, has made the difficult decision to postpone the ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Nations)\u00a0leaders meeting previously scheduled for mid-March.\nThe United States values our relationships with the nations of this critical region, and looks forward to future meetings,\u201d\u00a0a senior administration official told CNN. Exact plans for the meeting had not been announced, but administration officials said they expected President Trump to attend and to have bilateral meetings while there. The global death toll from coronavirus has reached 2,922. On Friday, 47 more people died in mainland China from coronavirus, according to China\u2019s National Health Commission (NHC). All but two of those deaths were in Hubei province, where the outbreak is believed to have started. That brings mainland China's total death toll to 2,835 since the start of the outbreak in December last year. Another 87 people have died of coronavirus outside of China.  Iran: 34 deaths\nItaly: 21 deaths\nSouth Korea: 16 deaths\nJapan: 10 deaths\nHong Kong: 2 deaths\nFrance: 2 deaths\nPhilippines: 1 death\nTaiwan: 1 death The situation in mainland China: Confirmed cases in mainland China increased by 427 on Friday, with 423 in Hubei province. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China is now\u00a079,251. China's NHC added that a total of\u00a039,002\u00a0patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital. At the start of February, China reported thousands of new cases each day. Now, the number of new cases reported have appear to have stabilized. On Wednesday, for the first time during the outbreak, the number of\u00a0new\u00a0cases\u00a0reported outside of China in a single day was larger than those reported\u00a0inside\u00a0China, the World Health Organization said.  Hospitals battling Italy's growing coronavirus outbreak are facing a \"crisis,\" according to health officials in the southern European nation. Italy now has over 820 cases, making it one of the worst hit countries in the world. Lombardy, in northern Italy, has 531 confirmed cases and a death toll of 17, the region's health secretary Giulio Gallera said Friday.  And hospitals are struggling to cope. If the (coronavirus) keeps spreading, there will be a crisis of the\u00a0hospitals, not only for those infected, but for all patients,\u201d Gallera said. Professor Massimo Galli, head of the department of infectious diseases at Sacco\u00a0Hospital\u00a0in Milan, said that some hospitals were already facing an overcrowding crisis.   The strain on health care infrastructure has long been a concern attached to the outbreak. In the Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus is thought to have originated, hospitals were initially unable to cope with the influx of new patients, a situation that is thought to have helped accelerate the spread of the virus during the early stages of the outbreak. If you're just joining us, here's what's been happening over the last few hours. Highest level of alert: The World Health Organization increased the global risk from the outbreak from high to very high. \u201cThis thing can go in any direction. We\u2019re not undermining the risk, it\u2019s there,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said during a press briefing in Geneva on Friday.\u00a0 Global spread: The total number of confirmed cases now stands at more than 84,000, with more than 5,000 cases outside of mainland China.
