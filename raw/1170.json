This time, though, officials say they'll be better prepared.\u00a0 A flurry of images on Saturday showed passengers squeezed together and waiting to get through US customs, after returning from overseas. Passengers shared stories of hours-long backups, inconsistent screenings, and waiting shoulder-to-shoulder to be processed through.\u00a0\u00a0 Wait times have since decreased. But as the Trump administration remedies the issues raised over the weekend, it's on the cusp of putting in place more restrictions that could also sow confusion. What we know: To avoid the backups that occurred over the weekend, US Customs and Border Protection is upping its staff at airports and adding more people on shifts. CBP has also streamlined the process, in coordination with others involved in screening, in order to expedite the processing and screening capacity to avoid long wait times. The enhanced screenings are part of an administration effort to handle the coronavirus pandemic. Countries around the world have shut down their borders and placed increased restrictions on movement and social gatherings.\u00a0 The Trump administration began by restricting travel from China, then Iran. Last week, Trump extended those restrictions to include certain European countries, effective Friday night. The United Kingdom and Ireland were initially excluded, but limits for those countries take effect Monday at midnight. US citizens, green card holders and their family members are exempt from the restrictions. What's happening Monday night: Starting at 11:59 p.m. ET Monday, people returning home from Ireland and the United Kingdom will also undergo enhanced entry at the same 13 airports, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Passengers coming in from Europe's Schengen Area\u201426 countries stretching from Iceland to Greece\u2014have been funneled to the airports where they undergo enhanced screening. They first go through customs, then are screened by Homeland Security medical contractors, and in the event, someone exhibits symptoms or other red flags, passengers will be referred to CDC personnel on site. Officials expect changes made to the system and collaboration with the airline industry will put CBP, and the agencies working alongside them, in a position to respond to new arrivals.\u00a0\u00a0 The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. ##Travel## New York Gov.

Watch: ##Business## \u00a0President Trump said he\u2019s offered a grim assessment of the coronavirus outbreak with his 13-year-old son. \u201cIt's bad, it's bad,\u201d Trump said in describing his conversations about the crisis with his youngest son Barron. \u201cBut we're going to hopefully be a best case, not a worst case.\u201d That outlook is markedly different in tone than Trump has offered previously on the outbreak, which he\u2019s attempted to minimize.

Eric Holcomb announced the state\u2019s first death due to novel coronavirus.\u00a0 The patient had health issues and was in the high-risk category of being over 60, according to Dr. Ram Yeleti, the chief physician executive with Community Health Network. The patient\u2019s significant other is also infected, Yeleti said, so the two could not be together when the patient passed away. The hospital had to use iPad conferencing so the two could see each other, Yeleti said. One nurse stayed in the room, so the patient didn\u2019t have to die alone, the doctor said.\u00a0 Several healthcare workers have now been quarantined, Yeleti said. There are not enough beds, so hospitals stopped all elective surgeries this past weekend. The Indiana State Department of Health reported that there are at least 24 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus. ##Health## Ohio\u00a0Gov.

Mike DeWine announced on Monday that he is recommending moving the primary election that was slated to take place on Tuesday to June over fears around the spread of the novel coronavirus. \u201cIt is clear that tomorrow\u2019s in person voting does not conform, and cannot conform with these CDC guidelines. We cannot conduct this election tomorrow, the in person voting for 13 hours tomorrow and conform to these guidelines,\u201d DeWine said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe should not be in a situation where the votes of these individuals, who are conflicted, are suppressed. It is therefore my recommendation after talking with the secretary of state, talking with the attorney general, talking with the lieutenant governor, that voting be extended until June 2nd. That no in person voting occur today, but rather that in person voting occur on June 2nd, but between now and then that absentee ballot voting be permitted.\u201d Important to note: DeWine, however, said he does not have the power to move the primary unilaterally and will now go to court to move the primary. The move is a complicated one for Ohio officials, as voters have already started voting in the state where 136 pledged delegates are at stake. The spread of the coronavirus has effectively stopped in person campaigning in the Democratic primary, forcing Biden and Sanders to cancel rallies and town halls. It has also had significant implications on down ballot races. Ohio is now the latest state to move elections based on the spread of the coronavirus, joining Louisiana, where state officials moved the presidential primary to June, and Georgia, where elections officials will postpone the March 24 presidential primary to May 19.\u00a0Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Joe Barbuto also announced Friday that \"the in-person portion\" of their state's caucuses were \"suspended due to growing concern\" over the virus. But Ohio\u2019s move is the most significant, given voting had already begun in the state and that it is a sizable delegate prize in the nomination fight.

As the coronavirus spreads, so do bogus claims and conspiracy theories.\u202fIn today's episode, Gupta sets the record straight on some of the most inaccurate information floating around. You can listen to the episode here. A lead investor in a German biotech company that is working on a coronavirus vaccine has issued a statement saying that it should be available anywhere, without mentioning US President Donald Trump. The comments by Dietmar Hopp, the main investor in CureVac, come after the company denied a report that Trump was trying to lure its scientists to the US in a statement Sunday. It did not deny being in touch with the President or US government, but rejected rumors of an acquisition. Hopp said: \u201cI am equally committed to the goal of protecting all people from infections and improving therapies for patients worldwide, ideally curing them, as well as to my intention of creating sustainable innovative infrastructure and jobs in Germany.  \"Hopefully, we will soon succeed in developing an effective vaccine against the coronavirus.

The source familiar tells CNN that a curfew\u00a0could\u00a0be strongly encouraged at the state level. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s spokeswoman Katie Miller strongly disputed that a curfew was under discussions. \u201cA curfew is not on the table,\u201d she said.

The Trump campaign depends on the trove of data produced by his \"Keep America Great\" arena rallies to target and engage potential voters, and without regular rallies in key states, they are being forced to improvise. Trump's team is now touting its unique preparedness through \"unprecedented virtual and digital campaign tools.\"\u00a0 We\u2019re better positioned to virtually engage voters than any other campaign,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.\u00a0 According to a campaign press release, those tools are expected to include: \"holding virtual events with top surrogates, utilizing online platforms to train thousands of members of the Trump Neighborhood Team, activating the massive volunteer network to make calls to rally support for the President in states voting soon, and increasing online voter registration efforts of Trump rally attendees identified as not currently registered to vote.\"  The events currently\u00a0scheduled\u00a0on the campaign\u2019s website are \u201cin the process of being turned into virtual seminars and a Trump Victory Organizer will contact attendees with more details,\u201d the website says.  Trump has a key advantage over his Democratic opponent during the public health crisis: incumbent status.\u00a0 \"Americans want to see their President, their elected officials, their government acting in ways that protect the safety of the citizens and the national security of this country,\" campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CNN.\u00a0 The Trump campaign is currently requiring all staffers at its Northern Virginia headquarters to work from home through Monday while the office undergoes a deep clean. It's unclear if the office will reopen on Tuesday.\u00a0 Trump initially pushed his campaign not to cancel any events in light of the coronavirus outbreak, and aides fear a restless President if he's unable to hold rallies, something he's done continuously throughout his time in office.\u00a0 The risk of holding campaign events came to light this week after a donor who attended a Trump Victory event, which raises money for the campaign and Republican National Commitee, tested positive for coronavirus. ##Daily Life## A federal pilot program to implement drive-up testing sites will be operational by midweek, according to a news release.

Gretchen Whitmer will order all bars and restaurants to close at 3 p.m. ET today, according to her spokeswoman Tiffany Brown.  Restaurants will be be allowed to serve takeout and delivery only, Brown said.  ##Daily Life## The UK government is walking a tightrope in its response to the coronavirus outbreak\u00a0 On one hand, it is doing everything it can to keep the public calm, and delay taking the most drastic measures to prevent the spread until absolutely necessary.\u00a0 On the other, it is scrambling to let the British public know that it's taking this pandemic seriously.\u00a0 Over the weekend, public criticism that the government's response had been less drastic than that of other countries -- and accusations that it was playing roulette with the nation's health -- led to confusing briefings from government officials. And those briefings in some cases seemed to directly contradict what Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told the nation in a high-profile press conference days earlier.  Over the weekend, suggestions that over-70s would be placed in lengthy quarantine and that public gatherings could soon be banned caused confusion among the public, soon after the prime minister had urged the public to remain calm and explained why these measures were not being taken immediately.\u00a0 Last Thursday, flanked by the UK's chief medical officer and chief scientific advisor, Johnson explained that even as the nation upped its response to the virus, it would not be shutting schools or banning mass gatherings. Johnson explained that the scientific evidence suggested that doing so would not do anything to prevent the spread and could have a negative impact on the National Health Service.\u00a0 This slow approach made the UK an outlier, as its response was less strict than its European counterparts. It didn't take long for Johnson's critics to accuse him of playing roulette with the nation's health. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the respected medical journal The Lancet, tweeted: \"What is happening in Italy is real and taking place now. Our government is not preparing us for that reality. We need immediate and assertive social distancing and closure policies. We need to prepare the NHS. This is a serious plea.\" Government sources acknowledged to CNN on Monday that the longer-term scenario was moving faster than initially expected. They explained that the number of confirmed cases had grown quicker than planned and that the number of elderly people testing positive had caused the government to move faster than they'd have initially liked to. \"There is an approach that hasn\u2019t changed but might have accelerated depending on the evidence,\" said one government minister.\u00a0 Impartial civil servants working directly on the government's response to Covid-19 are less generous, claiming that Johnson's inner circle was caught off guard. \"I don't think Number 10 are taking it seriously enough. Lots of people are very lax ... Number 10 are taking the approach of being the last people standing,\" one civil servant told CNN.\u00a0 Downing Street was approached for comment on not taking it seriously enough but had declined to respond at time of publication However, for all the noise over the weekend, very little has actually so far changed in terms of policy. For the time being, this is more government officials putting out fires than anything else.\u00a0 Downing Street is being uncharacteristically helpful and responsive to journalist questions over its Covid-19 response and has committed to giving daily press briefings.  Johnson will give the first of these later today. It will be the first indication of whether or not this flurry of activity over the weekend actually marks a serious change in government policy, or if the Johnson is happy that the UK remains a global outlier. Ukraine\u00a0International Airlines has suspended all international scheduled flights starting tomorrow through March 31, based on the decision of the country's government to temporarily ban foreigners from entering\u00a0Ukraine.

The website was supposed to direct Californians\u00a0who live in the wider San Francisco area\u00a0to one of two locations in the state where they could be tested for the novel coronavirus, if they met certain criteria established in an online questionnaire.  At first, users who reported they were suffering from symptoms such as \u201csevere cough, shortness of breath, fever or other conceding symptoms\" were advised they were not eligible for testing.\u00a0If\u00a0you went to the tool and answered \u201cyes\u201d to the symptoms question, the tool told you \u201cbased on your symptoms, in-person COVID-19 testing through this program is not the right fit.\u201d\u00a0 When asked why those with symptoms were being advised not to receive testing, Verily spokeswoman Carolyn Wang told CNN that the tool is meant for those who are unsure if they are infected.\u00a0 \"The\u00a0initial question is meant to ensure that anyone who is seriously ill does not come\u00a0to our sites because they are not prepared to provide medical attention,\u201d she said in a statement. \"We are early in this pilot and are going to be learning more that will help us refine this COVID-9 risk screening and testing.\u201d Verily later updated the questionnaire\u00a0to ask\u00a0if users are experiencing \u201csevere symptoms,\u201d and to emphasize that the tool is not for those with severe symptoms.\u00a0 The tool still advises those who report severe symptoms to\u00a0\u201cseek medical attention\u201d and refers those visitors to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.\u00a0 However, in testing the website, CNN also discovered that answering the questionnaire correctly \u2014 meaning responding in ways that met the site\u2019s criteria for coronavirus testing \u2014 led to\u00a0another error message\u00a0The message said: \u201cUnfortunately, we are unable to schedule more appointments at this time,\u201d suggesting that there aren\u2019t enough testing appointments available even for those who warrant testing.\u00a0 The Verily website launch follows a series of announcements from the Trump\u00a0administration in recent days that Google was developing a large scale testing website. On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence promised that\u00a0\u201cfor Americans looking on \u2026 we\u2019ll be able to give specific guidance on when the website will be available, you can go to the website, as the President said, you type in your symptoms and be given direction whether or not a test is indicated.\u201d\u00a0 But only Verily, not Google, appears ready with a testing website at this time, and it is limited in scope to California. Google is developing an\u00a0educational site to provide\u00a0information about the coronavirus, but the company\u2019s announcement stopped short of describing it as a website connecting users to test locations.\u00a0 Remember: Verily\u2019s site is distinct from a nationwide\u00a0informational website\u00a0Google is building to address the coronavirus.\u00a0 Verily and Google are both owned by the same parent company, Alphabet, but Verily is a different business from Google.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## ##Health## Simon Crow is not a professional athlete.

The EOIR said in a tweet late on Sunday all non-detained master calendar hearings -- cases of immigrants who are not in detention and are just beginning immigration proceedings -- will be postponed. Last Friday, the federal agency said those hearings would only be postponed at select immigration courts.\u00a0 Master calendar hearings often bring large groups of people to the courtroom, raising concern while the country tries to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The move to extend the postponing of these hearings came hours after immigration judges, lawyers and ICE prosecutors called for courts to be closed altogether. EOIR has not gone that far yet, saying that all other hearings will proceed. The Seattle immigration court will be closed through April 10. ##Daily Life## The European Union launched measures to support its member states in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said Monday.\u00a0 As of today, we will be launching joint procurements for protective equipment, testing kits and ventilators,\u201d Kyriakides tweeted after a video conference with European counterparts. \"Essential goods and medicines must be able to cross borders as smoothly as possible,\u201d the European health commissioner added, calling for \u201csolidarity and cooperation\u201d across the EU.

The alliances warned that the forecasted revenue loss does not include travel restrictions recently imposed by the US and other countries. European low-cost carrier Ryanair said that it could not rule out the full grounding of its aircraft fleet as a result of the coronavirus. The airline said in a press release Monday that travel restrictions \u201cmany of which have been imposed without notice\u201d have had a significant negative impact, and it expected the result would be the grounding of the majority of its aircraft across Europe over the next seven to 10 days. \"We are working with our people and our unions across all EU countries to address this extraordinary and unprecedented Covid-19 event,\" the company said.

Iran is one of the countries with the highest number of coronavirus cases outside mainland China. \u201cRefugees, most of whom live side-by-side with host communities in villages, towns and cities, are at the same risk of catching and transmitting the new coronavirus as Iranians,\u201d the statement added. ##Health## The German state of Bavaria has declared a state of emergency as the country's economics ministry issued a stark warning. Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state bordering Switzerland and Austria, said on Monday in Munich that \u201cthe situation is very serious and changing every day, unfortunately not for the better.\u201d Meanwhile, in a statement released Monday, the German Ministry for Economics said that the coronavirus outbreak was affecting the country's economy. \"How strong and for how long cannot yet be reliably assessed because no meaningful economic data are available yet,\" read the statement. \u201cIt is also still too uncertain how fast and how much the coronavirus will spread. Due to the very dynamic development, however, relevant economic effects must be expected.  \"The German economy was in the process of overcoming the phase of weakness which had persisted since the beginning of 2018, related to the global industrial recession and the trade conflicts ... This is no longer expected.\u201d ##Business## WATCH: NBA star Karl-Anthony Towns announced Sunday that he is donating $100,000 to the Mayo Clinic to assist with coronavirus testing. \"My hope is that we can fight this virus quicker and more efficiently by increasing the testing capabilities and availability and Mayo Clinic\u2019s overall Covid-19 response,\"\u00a0the Minnesota Timberwolves center wrote on Twitter.

His daughter, whose husband had tested positive for coronavirus on March 12,\u00a0evaded testing in the southern city of Bengaluru and fled to her parents home in Agra. When health authorities began reaching out to close contacts of the husband, the woman's father said she had already left the city for New Delhi. Later police discovered the woman was still in Agra and has since tested positive for coronavirus,\u00a0according to Prabhu N. Singh, the city's district magistrate. A case was registered against the father for \u201ca malignant act likely to spread\u00a0infection of\u00a0disease.\" The woman's husband arrived in India from Greece on March 6, according to B. Sriramulu,\u00a0Minister of Health and Family Welfare for Karnataka state. Global stock markets plunged Monday as investors were unnerved by drastic action from the US Federal Reserve to cushion the blow from coronavirus and data showed the outbreak has caused an unprecedented economic collapse in China. Markets were battered across Asia, with Australia's benchmark index crashing nearly 10% in its worst day on record. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 fell 7% in early trading, while France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX dropped roughly 9%.\u00a0 US markets were poised to suffer heavy losses. Dow futures were last down 1,041 points, or about 4.5%. S&P 500 futures slumped 4.8%, while Nasdaq futures shed 4.5%. There are now more than 3,000 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to government agencies and the CDC. Investors bailed out of stocks despite a major intervention by the US Federal Reserve on Sunday. The central bank slashed rates to close to zero at an emergency meeting, and said it would purchase another $700 billion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The rate cut is designed to prevent the economic shock leading to the kind of credit crunch and financial market disruptions that occurred during the global financial crisis -- the last time the Fed cut rates all the way to the bottom.\u00a0 \"I don't think [the Fed] would have done this unless they felt the financial markets were at significant risk of freezing up tomorrow. They're very concerned the financial markets won't work. So I don't know how the markets take solace in this,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CNN Business. On Monday, airline stocks were badly hit as they announced waves of flight cancellations in response to global travel restrictions. Air France KLM opened 12% lower and IAG, owner of British Airways, fell 16%. Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil, declined 6% to $31.83 per barrel.

Mishustin said in a meeting that the decision to prevent the movement of people across the border was one of several \u201cproactive steps\u201d the Russian government was taking to combat the spread of the virus. \u201cPeople all over the world are being forced to change their usual way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proactive measures that we took back in February of this year allowed us to seriously limit the spread of coronavirus in Russia. We must do everything so the situation does not develop as it has in other countries, and we are consistently, depending on the spread of the pandemic, closing our borders.\u201d Russia moved to close its lengthy border with China as coronavirus spread in Asia.

One doctor is in his 40s in the state of Washington, the second is a 70-year-old from New Jersey. The physician in Paterson, NJ, leads his institution\u2019s emergency preparedness and was admitted to the hospital several days ago with upper respiratory problems.

As emergency physicians, we know the risks of our calling. We stand united with our colleagues and our thoughts and prayers for a full and speedy recovery are with each of them and their families. \"It is my hope that these colleagues and their cases serve as a reminder to each of us to stay vigilant. This virus is dangerous, and its impact is still unfolding,\" Jaquis added.  \"As emergency physicians, we answer the call to care for our most vulnerable, even at great personal risk. Knowing that, I urge each of you to meticulously follow the recommended precautions to protect yourself.\" ##Health## The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida has temporarily closed following the novel coronavirus outbreak, the complex announced on its website.  No reservations or bookings will be accepted while the center is closed, but daily admission tickets for dates from March 16 until the facility reopens will be refunded.\u00a0 Chief Operating Officer Therrin Protze said in an accompanying letter: \"When it is deemed safe for guests to return, the entire facility will be cleaned and sanitized prior to re-opening. This will include Kennedy Space Center Tour buses, all attractions, eateries and theaters at the main campus and at the Apollo/Saturn V Center.\" No reopening date was provided.\u00a0 ##Travel## Chinese state media has criticized the UK and other Western nations' response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, alleging they have adopted a policy of \"total surrender.\"  In several articles over the weekend, Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times questioned the UK's decision to not introduce stricter social distancing measures -- unlike Italy, France, Germany and Spain.  UK government ministers estimate that the outbreak may not peak until 14 weeks from now and have argued that it would be detrimental to implement such measures at this stage of the outbreak. \"Such a laissez-faire mindset and lax measures are considered extremely irresponsible and risk causing a rebound in China due to the growing number of imported infections,\" one article in Global Times said.  Second wave: There are growing fears in Asia of the possibility of a second wave of infections from imported cases.  Undoing the work: Asian countries including China, South Korea, and Singapore have seen caseloads stabilize in recent weeks, thanks largely to a combination of aggressive containment and social distancing measures. But a rise in infections linked to overseas travel has led to concerns that those sacrifices could be undone.  Stricter measures: Governments across the region are now stepping up quarantine and travel restrictions. From Monday, all overseas travelers arriving in the Chinese capital Beijing will be sent to quarantine facilities for 14 days at their own cost, according to state media. And from March 19, Hong Kong will expand it 14-day mandatory self-quarantine to include the UK, alongside 30 other countries and regions.  Singapore has also had success at containing the virus. Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Singapore\u2019s Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said the city state's concern with cases in countries such as the UK and Switzerland is that it \"isn\u2019t just about the numbers.\"  \"It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,\u201d\u00a0Wong said. \u201cIf there\u2019s no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.\u201d  On Friday, the World Health Organization's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Europe had become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. \"More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,\" he said. Read more here As the number of coronavirus cases grows globally, many people will be concerned that they or their family members may have caught the disease. In most cases, the coronavirus\u00a0makes people sick, usually with a mild\u00a0to moderate\u00a0upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold.  Its symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days. For those\u00a0with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis. If you want to protect yourself, there's no vaccine yet and may not be for many months. In the meantime, you may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Awareness is also key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be coronavirus, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early. ##Health## ##Your Questions## Chick-fil-a is temporarily closing its dining room seating to help limit person-to-person contact amid the coronavirus pandemic, the restaurant chain announced in a post on its website today.

Golpayegani was hospitalized in Qom on Saturday. Several political and religious figures have been infected by the coronavirus in Iran. Some have died, including newly-elected female politician Fatemeh Rahbar. Iran has recorded nearly 14,000 infections and 724 deaths from the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization.  Xiong Qingzhen, a drone engineer in the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan, spent more than two weeks in a makeshift hospital in February receiving treatment for Covid-19, the respiratory disease causing a global health crisis. Every morning and evening, the 38-year-old was handed a bag of brown soup -- a traditional Chinese remedy blended from over 20 herbs, including ephedra, cinnamon twigs and licorice root. But unlike most patients around him, Xiong was skeptical of its efficacy and refused to drink it. \"In my opinion, it is a sheer placebo,\"\u00a0Xiong said. The \"lung-clearing and detoxing soup,\" as the herbal compound he was given is called, was part of the Chinese government's push to use Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak. As scientists race to find a cure and vaccine, China is increasingly turning to its traditional remedies. As of late last month, more than 85% of all coronavirus patients in China -- about 60,000 people -- had received herbal remedies alongside mainstream antiviral drugs, according to the\u00a0Ministry of Science and Technology.

Jerome Salomon said that the coronavirus epidemic was \"very quick,\" with the number of cases currently doubling \"every three days.\" \"The epidemic in France is very worrying,\" he said. \"The situation concerns children as well as elders.\u201d  Salomon did specify that there were relatively few cases concerning children. \"We can all counter the epidemic by respecting the measures, the barrier measures that French people know but that they\u2019re not applying now,\" he said. French measures: France has closed restaurants, cafes, cinemas and clubs, and issued a ban on large gatherings to contain the spread of the virus. More than half of the country's 300 coronavirus patients in intensive care are under the age of 60, Salomon said on Saturday. There are more than 5,300 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in France, including 127 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Some of the EU's top leaders will be holding a meeting today about the coronavirus pandemic that is spreading rapidly across Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron will be discussing the coronavirus outbreak with German chancellor Angela Merkel, European Council President Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen on Monday at 5 a.m. ET, the Elysee Palace announced.\u00a0 France and Germany have both seen large outbreaks of the coronavirus, with more than 5,000 people infected in each country. In total, six of the 10 countries worst affected by the pandemic are in Europe. President Donald Trump has repeatedly described the coronavirus outbreak in the United States as\u00a0a problem\u00a0that nobody anticipated. The crisis is \"an unforeseen problem\" that \"came out of nowhere,\" Trump\u00a0said\u00a0on March 6. \n\"We're having to fix a problem that, four weeks ago, nobody ever thought would be a problem,\" he\u00a0said\u00a0on March 11. \"It's something that nobody expected,\" he\u00a0said\u00a0again on March 14. Trump's attempt to improve perceptions of his response by depicting the pandemic as a shock to everyone is just one of\u00a0numerous ways\u00a0he has dishonestly described the crisis. Trump claimed Saturday that the situation has been \"urgent for me\" from the very beginning, citing his late-January\u00a0decision\u00a0to restrict travel from China. But Trump\u00a0downplayed\u00a0the severity of the issues facing the US long after that -- even as experts were issuing the warnings Trump is now suggesting did not happen.

The provinces listed are: Tibet autonomous regions \nXinjiang autonomous region \nQinghai\nFujian\nAnhui\nJiangxi\nShanxi \nHunan\nJiangsu\nChongqing \nGuizhou\nJilin\nTianjin municipality But the news comes as Wuhan -- the capital of Hubei province where the virus was first identified -- warned it is still facing a \"severe\" epidemic amid a continuation of locally transmitted cases. ##Daily Life## ##Health## As of this morning, Germany has shut its borders with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark, as the coronavirus spreads across Europe. Anyone wishing to enter from those countries after 3 a.m. ET Monday will need a good reason to do so, German interior minister Horst Seehofer said in Berlin Sunday. Goods and commuters will be exempt from the ban, he said. ##Travel## New studies in several countries and a large coronavirus outbreak in Massachusetts are bringing into question reassurances by US officials about the way the coronavirus is spreading. Previously, officials have emphasized that the virus is spread mainly by people who are already showing symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing.  If that's true, it's good news -- people who are obviously ill can be identified and isolated, making it easier to control an outbreak. But it appears that a Massachusetts coronavirus cluster with at least 82 cases was started by people who were not yet showing symptoms, and more than half a dozen studies have shown that people without symptoms are causing substantial amounts of infection. During a press briefing at the White House on Saturday, the administration's coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, seemed to strike a somewhat different note on asymptomatic transmission. \"Until you really understand how many people are asymptomatic and asymptomatically passing the virus on, we think it's better for the entire American public to know that the risk of serious illness may be low, but they could be potentially spreading the virus to others.\" Read the full article here. ##Health## Fears of imported infections: As cases blow up in Europe and North America, fear is growing in Asia of the possibility of a second wave of infections from imported cases.

All European travelers will need to go through temperature checks, a medical survey, and monitor their temperature daily.

On Monday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also warned of a \"significant\" economic impact from the novel coronavirus outbreak during a press conference. \"The preliminary advice I have received from the Treasury this weekend is that the economic impact of the virus on New Zealand could be greater than the impact of the global financial crisis,\" she said. As a precautionary measure, New Zealand will also cancel all public gatherings involving 500 or more people, with the exception of schools or universities, she announced. ##Business## Wuhan, the Chinese city where the novel coronavirus was first identified, is still facing a \"severe\" epidemic, amid a continuation of locally transmitted cases, the city's municipal health commission said in a press conference Sunday.
