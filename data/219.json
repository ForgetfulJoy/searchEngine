Follow the latest developments from around the globe here. Some antibody tests, which check for prior Covid-19 infection, had high rates of false positives in screenings performed by a consortium of California laboratories,\u00a0according to a recently released report.\u00a0\u00a0 A false positive means someone would be told they\u2019d already had coronavirus when they had not \u2013 a potential danger as people could then think they were immune to the virus when they\u2019re actually\u00a0still\u00a0vulnerable.\u00a0\u00a0 Of the 12 antibody tests that were studied by the COVID-19 Testing Project, one of the tests gave false positives more than 15% of the time, or in about one out of seven samples. Three other tests gave false positives more than 10% of the time.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. That\u2019s really terrible,\u201d said Dr. Caryn Bern, one of the authors of the study that looked at the 12 tests.\u00a0\u00a0She said while it\u2019s unrealistic to think all tests will be 100% accurate all the time, their false positive rates should be 5% or lower, or ideally 2% or lower.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis was a real wake up call for me. We\u2019re not at the point where any of these tests can be used reliably,\u201d added study coauthor Dr. Alexander Marson. \u201cThere\u2019s a big danger in relying on them at all, but we hope we get to a point soon where we can rely on these tests.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 The COVID-19 Testing Project is a consortium of researchers and physicians at the University of California San Francisco, the University of California Berkeley, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, and the Innovative Genomics Institute.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Testing## America\u2019s largest meatpacking union warned that without increased safety measures for workers, food supply itself is at risk. The union's warning comes after news that President Trump is expected to order meat processing plants to\u00a0stay open. Marc Perrone, the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said the union wants daily testing for both workers and their communities, access to the federal stockpile of personal protective equipment, enforcement of physical distancing at plants, and paid sick leave for infected workers to keep employees safe. The union urged the Trump administration to lay out \u201cclear and enforceable safety standards,\" including constant monitoring by federal inspectors and ensuring worker access to representation. These workers \u201cput their lives at risk daily to keep us fed,\u201d the UFCW said. \u201cSimply put, we cannot have a secure food supply without the safety of these workers,\u201d Perrone said. \u201cWe share the concern over the food supply,\u201d he said, ending with a call to leaders at all levels: \u201cAll of our country\u2019s elected leaders \u2014 federal and state \u2014 must work together to ensure that we keep these essential workers safe and our country\u2019s food supply secure.\u201d ##Food Supply## Three meatpacking facilities in the Green Bay, Wisconsin, area now account for over half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases in that county.\u00a0 Of the total 920 confirmed positives in Brown County, 503 of them are either employees at or linked to JBS USA, American Foods Group, or Salm Partners, according to the county health department.  At least 255 employees at JBS USA tested positive and 79 cases were linked to them \u2014 meaning more positive cases could be traced to spouses, friends or other close contacts.\nAt least 145 employees at American Foods Group tested positive with seven linked cases. \nAt least 17 employees at Salm Partners tested positive based on latest available data from the county. All three facilities were inspected by county, state, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials, and passed inspections, according to the Brown County Health Department. JBS chose to voluntarily shut down their Green Bay plant on Sunday prior to President Trump\u2019s executive order. The Brown County Health Department said they are not able to prove these outbreaks are a result of conditions at the facilities and said they cannot prove that is where the spread is occurring.  ##Food Safety## US officials\u00a0were part of the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0delegation that traveled to China in the early weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak, but\u00a0they\u00a0were not part of the group that traveled to Wuhan, a State Department spokesperson said. According to the spokesperson, \u201cupon arrival, the delegation traveled in groups to several locations, but Americans were not among those who traveled to Wuhan.\u201d It is unclear\u00a0why the\u00a0US officials did not travel to the city at the center of the outbreak.\u00a0CNN has reached out to\u00a0the State Department\u00a0for\u00a0clarity.\u00a0 While in Wuhan, the\u00a0WHO delegation visited the airport, a hospital, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, including one of their labs.  They did not visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to a WHO visit summary.\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in mid-April that \u201cwe still have not had Western access to that facility so that we can properly evaluate what really has taken off all across the world and how that began.\u201d Although the State Department acknowledged that Americans were part of the WHO delegation, Pompeo has repeatedly called out China for denying requests\u00a0from the Trump administration to\u00a0allow\u00a0American scientists on the ground.\u00a0 \u201cThis President and this administration worked diligently to work to get Americans on the ground there in China, to help to the World Health Organization try to get in there as well. We were rebuffed,\u201d Pompeo said on\u00a0Thursday. \u201cThe Chinese Government wouldn\u2019t let it happen, indeed just the opposite of transparency.\u201d\u00a0 In less than three months, more Americans have died from coronavirus than the number of US service members killed in the Vietnam War, according to updated numbers from Johns Hopkins University on Tuesday afternoon. The American death toll in the Vietnam War was 58,220, with the fighting stretching out for more than 10 years.  According\u00a0to Johns Hopkins\u2019 tally of cases in the United States, at least\u00a058,365\u00a0people have died in the US from coronavirus in just 82 days.  The first known US coronavirus-related fatality was Feb. 6. Hear more: Minnesota's Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen said he wasn\u2019t surprised by President Trump\u2019s proposed executive order to work to keep meat processing plants open. Petersen said Minnesota farmers are facing a \u201cvery sobering situation\u201d as they try to keep their plants open. Minnesota started \u201cdepopulating\u201d its hog and turkey populations \u2014 about 70,000 animals each week, he said. Petersen said the state is open to anything that would get processing plants running again, but it has to be done in a way that makes workers feel safe. \u201cOur plants in Minnesota want to run, they don\u2019t want to start and stop, but they (the companies) want to do it right,\" Petersen said. Out of the 24 hog, poultry and turkey plants operating in Minnesota, only four of them have been closed, according to Petersen. The problem is that most of their hogs go to two of the plants that were closed in South Dakota, he said. ##Food Supply## Wyoming will allow gyms and personal services business like hair and nail salons to reopen Friday under tight restrictions. \"These new orders start our process of getting this part of Wyoming\u2019s economy up and running again,\u201d Gov. Mark Gordon said. Under the new rules taking effect May 1, gyms and salons will have to maintain social distancing and also keep contact information of all their customers to allow for contact tracing in case of a future outbreak.\u00a0Gatherings of 10 or more people are prohibited, including inside businesses. In-person dining will continue to be prohibited and restaurants can only allow up to five people at a time indoors to wait for their food to be picked up.\u00a0All employees in a retail businesses must wear masks. ##Reopening## Some businesses in North Dakota are set to reopen on Friday, Gov. Doug Burgum announced today. Qualifying businesses, such as bars and restaurants, recreational facilities, health clubs and athletic facilities, cosmetologists, salons, barber shops, tattoo studios, tanning and massage facilities, will be asked to adhere to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and recommendation from the North Dakota Department of Health. These guidelines include maintaining 6 feet of distance, providing contactless payment systems and informing all employees and customers that they should avoid entering the facility if they have a cough or fever. ##Reopening## A Turkish military plane carrying thousands of donated medical supplies landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Tuesday evening. The plane was met by Turkish Ambassador to the US Serdar K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Reeker. In remarks on the tarmac, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 said he would deliver a letter from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to President Trump. He said the shipment was dispatched upon Erdogan\u2019s instruction and \u201ctestifies to the Turkish people\u2019s will to support our longstanding ally, United States, in its ongoing difficult fight against Covid-19.\u201d \u201cWe hope that this aid will help alleviate the enormous burden shouldered by the devoted health workers in the United States who work day and night to save lives of the others at the expense of risking their own life,\u201d he said. Reeker said the shipment was \u201can important demonstration of NATO unity and the strength of US-Turkey ties and our strong historic relationship.\u201d \u201cOn behalf of the Secretary, the President and the people of the United States of America, thank you for this generous gift to the United States,\u201d he said. According to the Turkish Presidency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the cargo contains 500,000 surgical masks, protective coveralls, 1,500 goggles, 400 N95 masks and 500 face shields. The Turkish Presidency said that there were 2,000 liters of disinfectant also on board. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said gyms in 89 of Tennessee's 95 counties will be allowed to reopen on Friday, May 1.\u00a0 \"Restaurants are beginning to open. Retail outlets are set to open tomorrow, and today we are announcing that gyms will be allowed to reopen on Friday,\" Lee said.\u00a0 Gyms must reduce capacity to 50%, utilize social distancing, and remove shared equipment, he said.  Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey also spoke at the news conference announcing the state has met the White House's new testing guidance. \"President Trump asked last night for states to do 2% of their population of testing each month. We have already done that in the month of April, and we are making plans to do that going forward,\" Piercey said. \"About 135,000 tests have been done this month. That's about 2% of our state's population,\" she added.\u00a0 ##Reopening## South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said she worked with President Trump and the Department of Interior to ensure that a July 3 fireworks display at Mt. Rushmore National Memorial would happen. \"We\u2019re excited that this will be happening at Mount Rushmore. We\u2019ve been working on this for quite some time,\" Noem said. \"I want to thank the President and the Department of Interior for working with us to make it happen,\" she added. When asked about implications of a large gathering during the nationwide Covid-19 pandemic, Noem was unconcerned. \"We\u2019ll continue to evaluate what the crowd looks like and how we'll be able to facilitate that event but regardless of how many people will be there, the fireworks will go off and I can't think of a better way for us to celebrate America\u2019s birthday,\" Noem said. The White House coronavirus task force did not meet for a third day in a row, a source familiar with the schedule tells CNN.  This is rare given that until this weekend, the task force had met nearly every day since it was assembled, though there was a brief break on Easter weekend.\u00a0 This change could be an indication of what's to come.  CNN reported Monday that White House intends to scale back the large meetings.\u00a0Smaller groups of members on the task force are still meeting, the source added.\u00a0 The task force has its first meeting this week scheduled tomorrow.\u00a0 Major League Baseball will\u00a0allow teams to offer refunds on tickets for missed games beginning Wednesday, a source familiar with the league's decision tells CNN.  This is not a league mandate, and each team will be free to make its own decision regarding ticket refunds.\u00a0 MLB still considers all games missed so far this season as being postponed, not canceled. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned Americans could be in for \"a bad fall and a bad winter\"\u00a0if the United States isn\u2019t prepared for the return of the coronavirus. \u201cIf by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures that you need to address this, we should do reasonably well.\u00a0If we don't do that successfully, we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter,\u201d Fauci said on Tuesday\u00a0during an Economic Club of Washington webinar.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged tonight a lack of coronavirus testing needed in order to safely reopen businesses across the country. \u201cWe are not there yet on testing,\u201d McConnell said in a phone interview on Fox News. \u201cNot only what kind of test but how many of them actually will tell you something other than you don't have it at the moment.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have treatment, and we don\u2019t yet have a vaccine. We've allocated $25 billion at that whole area of testing and treatment and vaccine in the bill that we just passed last week. That's all part of reassuring everyone that they can safely go back to work.\u201d \u00a0 There are at least 1,008,066 coronavirus cases in the US, and at least 58,126 people have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said businesses must continue to try to telework where possible as part of a list of rules they must follow if they plan to reopen in the weeks to come. He said there must be a phased return to work for businesses and they must be able to provide onsite temperature or health checks. Masks and any other necessary personal protective equipment will also be mandatory. Beshear said businesses must close common areas such waiting rooms, cafeterias and break rooms, and will need to enforce social distancing, limit face-to-face meetings, and provide sanitizer or hand washing stations. Businesses will be required to make special accommodations for those especially at risk and there will need to be testing plans in place if an employee starts showing symptoms, he added. Bank of America sent 184,000 Payroll Protection Applications to the Small Business Administration on behalf of clients, but only 1,000 of those loans have been approved so far, according to a letter the bank shared with CNN. Although the SBA didn\u2019t immediately return CNN\u2019s request for comment, a senior administration official defended the agency by citing the number of applications approved across all lenders.\u00a0 The SBA has approved over 500,000\u00a0loans valued at over $55 billion as of Tuesday afternoon, the official told CNN. \u201cTo keep our clients informed and up to date, we have sent over 10 million emails to them. Today, we will communicate to each client whose application has been submitted to the SBA, advising them the loan application has been submitted, and we will notify each client promptly when the SBA has acted on the application,\" wrote\u00a0Dean Athanasia, who is president Consumer and Small Business at Bank of America,\u00a0in a memo to his senior leadership staff. Bank of America has \u201canother 48,000 client applications ready for the SBA,\u201d Athanasia wrote in the memo. \u201cOn Monday \u2013 after a 10-day delay waiting for additional funding from Congress, and then developing the additional guidelines for the program \u2013 the SBA began accepting PPP applications again,\u201d Athanasia wrote. The memo added, \u201csince they reopened at 10:30 am on Monday, we have been uploading these to the SBA through their slower, more manual process.\" ##Stimulus## The board of governors for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences issued new guidelines on Tuesday to make films that are only distributed digitally or on streaming platforms eligible for Academy Awards for the first time.  The change will apply to the 93rd Academy Awards, scheduled for\u00a0February 27, 2021, only. Previously, the Academy has required films to have a commercial theatrical run in order to be eligible for Oscars. \u201cThe Academy firmly believes there is no greater way to experience the magic of movies than to see them in a theater.\u00a0Our commitment to that is unchanged and unwavering. Nonetheless, the historically tragic COVID-19 pandemic necessitates this temporary exception to our awards eligibility rules,\"\u00a0Academy President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement.  \"The Academy supports our members and colleagues during this time of uncertainty. We recognize the importance of their work being seen and also celebrated, especially now, when audiences appreciate movies more than ever,\" the statement continued. Dr. Anthony\u00a0Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he\u2019s skeptical of the testing timeline which lays out ramping up test production as the summer starts.\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper,\u00a0Fauci\u00a0said, \u201cThe issue about tests is that as we get into the next weeks to several weeks to a month, as we get into May and June, from what we're hearing and I'm telling you, Jake what we're hearing from the people in the task force who deal directly with the companies, namely the major firms that make the test, this is predominantly Admiral Brett Giroir, is telling us that we will have a very, very increased production, so that by the time we get to those months, we should have what we need.\u201d \u201cBut you know my I'm always the skeptic in the group,\u201d\u00a0Fauci\u00a0added. \u201cAnd I always say OK, I hear you, I believe you. But let's see what happens. Let's see what happens.\u201d\u00a0 ##Testing## The head of Missouri\u2019s Chamber of Commerce says his group expects thousands of businesses in the state to close permanently because of the economic hit caused by the coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cAccording to our research, Missouri businesses are expected to lose a quarter of their revenue this year, and 15% of businesses \u2013 primarily small employers \u2013 are going out of business,\u201d Chamber President Dan Mehan said at a news conference Tuesday. Missouri is set to remove its statewide business restrictions on Monday, May 4.\u00a0 All businesses will be allowed to reopen on that date if they choose, but they still must continue to follow social distancing rules. Gov. Mike Parson said they can issue citations to businesses that aren\u2019t following the rules, but he thinks peer pressure will be the driving force for enforcement.\u00a0 \u201cI think demand is going to take care of a lot of this because people are going to want to go where they feel safe,\u201d Parson said. ##Reopening## California Gov. Gavin\u00a0Newsom\u00a0said allowing child care centers to operate will be part of the first phase of reopening for the state, but cautioned life will not return to normal in the state without a vaccine. \u201cWe are not going back to the way things were until we get to immunity or a vaccine,\u201d\u00a0Newsom\u00a0said in a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWe will base reopening plans on facts and data, not on ideology. Not what we want. Not what we hope.\u201d He said retail businesses and schools are \"weeks away\" from reopening based on an apparent stabilization in both the numbers of confirmed cases and of deaths due to coronavirus. Newsom added he believes workers and consumers must both be protected in order to lift restrictions.  Retail will gradually begin reopening with adaptations like curbside pickup, California Health Director Sonia Angell said. Some businesses where telework is not an option, such as public relations firms or consultants, may also be included if a lower risk is determined. Angell said parks and trails may reopen soon. The next phase is \u201cmonths not weeks away,\" Newsom said. He said the next phase will include personal care businesses such gyms, spas and salons, where workers come in close contact with customers. He added the final phase will allow the reopening of the highest risk events, such as concerts and conventions. Comparing research on the coronavirus to the early days of research on HIV/AIDs, Dr. Anthony Fauci today said researchers continue to make unexpected discoveries on how the infection damages the human body that could yield new avenues of treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing things that weren\u2019t quite noticed in the big chaos of the explosion of cases, first in China, then Europe, and now in the United States,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cNow we\u2019re starting to see things that on the one hand are puzzling but on the other hand are enlightening.\u201d Fauci said autopsies of the lungs of those who have died from the virus, in particular are revealing \u201cthings we didn\u2019t expect\u201d that are both \u201cfascinating and informative.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot to learn,\" Fauci told Tapper. \u201cIt\u2019s opening up the door, I believe, to some interventions that might be helpful.\u201d Fauci was a leading government researcher during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and has advised six presidents on HIV/AIDS, according to his official bio Watch: New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said canceling the 2021 Mardi Gras festivities is \"something we have to think about.\" Cantrell said that one of the factors she needs to consider is when the city reopens and the steps that are taken to make that happen. She said she wants the city's reopening to be slow and steady. \"It will give me great pause right now before I commit to saying we are moving forward with Mardi Gras 2021,\" Cantrell said in a broadcasted interview with The Washington Post. \"We will let the data dictate the dates.\"\u00a0 Asked during his daily press briefing about the mayor's comments, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who had not listened to the interview, said that Mardi Gras 2021 is far enough out that \"we don't know enough today to hazard a guess as to what the circumstances are going to be at that point and time.\" Mardi Gras begins on January 6 and Fat Tuesday in 2021 is February 16. Dr. Anthony Fauci said everyone who needs a test will be able to get a test by the end of May or beginning of June. \"Everyone who needs a test, according to the way we're approaching the identification, isolation, contact tracing, keeping the country safe and healthy, that hopefully we should see that as we get towards the end of May, the beginning of June,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. He said that timeline was given to him by the groups responsible for the testing. \u201cI take them for their word. If that doesn\u2019t happen, I am going to go to them and say, 'What happened? Why didn\u2019t it happen? How could we fix it?'\" Fauci said. He said needing a test is much different than just wanting a test. \"A lot of times\u00a0people say, I want a test, and\u00a0it\u2019s not part of a strategic\u00a0approach.\u00a0But needing is important,\" he said. \u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence told reporters Tuesday that he didn\u2019t wear a face mask while touring the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota because he\u2019s tested for coronavirus regularly. \u201cAs Vice President of the United States, I\u2019m tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus. And when the CDC issued guidelines about wearing a mask, it was their recognition that people that may have the coronavirus could prevent the possibility of conveying the virus to someone else by wearing a mask,\u201d Pence said. \u201cSince I don\u2019t have the coronavirus, I thought it\u2019d be a good opportunity for me to be here \u2026 and look (personnel) in the eye and say thank you,\u201d he continued. CNN previously reported\u00a0that while Pence didn\u2019t wear a mask, everyone around him did. Pence was told of the new rules before he visited, the clinic said on Twitter, a post that was subsequently deleted. Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper today that there needs to be a \u201cproductive partnership\u201d between the federal government and states on testing. \u201cThe federal government has to provide strategic guidance as well as technical assistance,\u201d Fauci said. He added that one of the problems has been getting the test to people who need them, \u201cwe\u2019re not connecting the dots.\u201d He said states can\u2019t be left on their own on the one hand and on the other hand \u201cthe federal government can\u2019t do it by its self.\u201d Watch: ##Testing## Connecticut reported an increase of 315 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the lowest number of new infections reported \u201cin weeks,\u201d Gov. Ned Lamont said in a news conference. There are at least 26,312 cases of Covid-19 in the state. Hospitalizations were slightly down on Tuesday. There were 1,732 hospitalizations in the state, a decrease of 26 since Monday.  The big curves in the state \u2014 which occurred mostly in the southern portion \u2014 are continuing to \u201cbend down,\u201d the governor said, though he, and the state's Public Health Department\u2019s top epidemiologist, Dr. Matthew Carter, stressed that the numbers are still high.\u00a0 Lamont also noted that the unemployment rate in Connecticut is currently north of 20% \u2014 the likes of which the state hasn\u2019t seen \u201csince the Great Depression.\u201d President Trump said the worst of the coronavirus is over in the United States during an event at the White House Tuesday, and when pressed by reporters, once again said he thinks the virus is going to \u201cgo away.\u201d In remarks at an event celebrating the second round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, the President said, \u201cour experts believe the worst days of our pandemic are behind us.\u201d  He was asked later how he could be so sure when the country is only beginning to reopen.\u00a0 \u201cI think what happens is it\u2019s going to go away. This is going to go away,\u201d the President responded, \u201cand whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall we\u2019ll be able to handle it. We\u2019ll be able to put out spurts. And we\u2019re very prepared to handle it.\u201d Trump significantly walked back his certainty that a vaccine would be developed quickly. \u201cI think that like other things, we\u2019re going to hopefully we\u2019re going to come up with a vaccine. You never know about a vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cTremendous progress has been made we think on a vaccine. You always have to say think, and then you have to test it, and that takes a period of time.\u201d\u00a0 Watch: A new program would provide masks to as many Utah residents as possible, the state's Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said at a news conference today. The \u201cmask for every Utahan\u201d program will allow residents to request a mask from the state free of charge. The masks will be manufactured by Utah-based businesses, according to Cox. He said in addition to providing masks for residents, the program will save at least 200 jobs in the state. Cox said that once the initial mask order is placed, it could take up to three weeks to have them delivered. \u00a0 President Trump said Tuesday that in addition to his friend\u00a0Stanley Chera, he\u2019s lost three other friends to coronavirus. The President also said he\u2019s spoken to at least three families of other individuals who have died from coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to three, maybe four families (of individuals who have died of coronavirus) unrelated to me. I lost a very good friend. I also lost three other friends,\u201d Trump said during an event in the East Room of the White House. He added: \u201cTwo of them I didn\u2019t know as well, but they were friends, people I did business with.\u201d Watch: The past 24 hours have seen more people in Illinois die due to Covid-19 than any other day yet, Illinois Department of Public Health Director, Dr. Ngozi Ezike announced at a news conference Tuesday. Ezike announced 144 new Covid-19 related deaths, bringing the state death total to 2,125. The state has seen 2,219 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. This brings the state total to 48,102 cases, Ezike said. US stocks lost steam after a buoyant market open, finishing the day lower. Here's what happened today: The Dow snapped a four-day winning streak, its longest since February. The index finished down 0.1%, or 32 points.\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.5%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer of the three major benchmarks as tech stocks fell. It ended down 1.4%. \u00a0 Michael Hinojosa, the superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District, said that despite the President Trump's comments suggesting schools should open for just a few weeks, \u201cwe really have to listen to our local businesses our local leaders and how we work together here in Dallas.\u00a0Every situation is different.\u201d\u00a0 He told CNN's Kate Bolduan he is grateful to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for closing schools. Hinojosa said he is very concerned about a potential spike in the virus.  \u201cParents will forgive us for a few things, but they won\u2019t forgive us if something happens to the health of their students under our care, custody and control,\" he said. The district is considering a split schedule for students, staggering arrivals and classroom lunches among the changes. Plan A is everyone shows up with no restrictions, but Hinojosa admitted, \u201cit\u2019s very unlikely that Plan A will ever happen.\u201d Requiring all students and teachers to wear masks is another option, he said.

CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta asked the President how the United States got to the grim milestone of one million coronavirus cases, from the President\u2019s prediction back in February that 15 US cases would turn to zero. \u201cIt will go down to zero, ultimately,\u201d he said Tuesday. At least 57,266 Americans have died of coronavirus. \u201cYou have to understand when it comes to cases, we do much more testing than any other country,\u201d the President said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show more cases because we\u2019re doing much more testing.\u201d He went on to repeat claims that, \u201cmany very good experts, very good people too, said this would never affect the United States.\u201d \u201cThe experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong and a lot of people didn\u2019t know it would be this serious,\u201d Trump said.

Jim Justice said in a press conference Tuesday that his administration plans to reopen local businesses Thursday. Justice announced 37 people have died due to coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic, but said the positive test result rate was under 3% Monday and today. Should the positive testing rate fall under 3% again tomorrow, certain healthcare-related businesses will be permitted to open Thursday, Justice said. Those qualifying businesses include pharmacies, chiropractors, dentists, psychologists,\u00a0physical therapists, social workers and others.\u00a0Daycare workers will be tested for the virus beginning this week and will reopen should all working personnel test negative.\u00a0 All businesses reopening will require personnel to sanitize, physically distance and wear face coverings. Phase two: If this week continues on track, more businesses will be permitted to open next Monday, Justice said. This second phase will include small businesses with less than 10 employees, outdoor dining at restaurants, salons and dog groomers.\u00a0 Places of worship are also expected to be included in that second phase but capacity will be restricted. ##Reopening## ##South## Erin Strine was flying home to be with her family after her grandmother passed away and was shocked to be on a packed American Airlines flight with people who were not wearing masks.  Strine, who took video of the packed flight, said an announcement was made after she boarded that passengers would not be able to move their seats and would not be able to social distance because the flight was full. \u201cIt was a scary thing to experience,\u201d Strine told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin. \u201cI would\u2019ve felt a little better knowing that everyone had been required to wear masks,\u201c she said. American Airlines announced today that the company would require flight attendants to wear face masks starting May 1. This comes after JetBlue became the first airline to require passengers to wear face coverings starting May 4. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said while face masks alone aren\u2019t enough, requiring them on flights does keep \u201ceveryone safer.\u201d Nelson added that coronavirus safety requirements should be consistent and that there needs to be a federal mandate for aviation policy regarding the virus across the board. She said that the rest of the world is \u201cheads above\u201d where the US currently is. \u201cCanada put this in place a week ago. Other countries around the world have had this in place for several weeks and months and we need to be leaders again among the world and take the best precautions for our health and safety,\u201d Nelson said. Brown University President Christina Paxson said opening colleges and universities in the fall is key for viability. Financial stressors existed before the pandemic during the last decade for higher education, Paxson told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. \u201cThose colleges and universities depend on tuition. If they can\u2019t bring students back safely, which is very important, then they are going to be under severe financial stress and I don\u2019t know how all of them will recover,\u201d she said. Brown is making a plan, but Paxson doesn\u2019t know if it will be implemented, echoing what she wrote in her New York Times op-ed Monday. She said it will depend on what happens with the pandemic in the coming months. Testing, tracing and separating those who are exposed or sick are all part of the plan, Paxson said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be, if we can do this, a normal academic year, it will be different. We are going to have to spend a lot of times working with our students helping them understand what they need to do to responsibly keep themselves and their community safe,\u201d she said.

Colorado received more than $10 million from the US Department of Health and Human Services to provide additional funding for epidemiological work and lab testing in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a press release from the Colorado State Joint Information Center.  The funding is part of various federal aid programs which provide assistance to states dealing with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe have our work ahead of us to slow the spread of Covid-19, and this additional funding will allow us to bolster our testing, case investigation, contact tracing, and outbreak investigation work at a critical time,\" Rachel Herlihy, the state\u2019s epidemiologist said in a statement. The CDC will provide further guidance on the specific spending parameters later this week, but generally the money is for a two-year period and is intended to go towards programs that \"enhance case investigation, contact tracing, and outbreak response, especially in high-risk settings and among at-risk populations,\" for example, the statement said. ##Testing## \u00a0\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence is touring the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, today, speaking with health care workers and plasma donors.

President Trump is expected to sign a five-page executive order under the Defense Production Act today that compels meat processing plants to remain open,\u00a0CNN has learned.\u00a0 Trump is expected to sign the order after some companies, like Tyson, were considering only keeping 20% of their facilities open. The vast majority of processing plans could have shut down, which would have reduced processing capacity in the country by as much as 80%, an official familiar says.\u00a0 By signing the order, Trump will declare these plants as a part of critical infrastructure in the US. The administration is also working with the Labor Department on issuing guidance about which employees should remain home. This is to protect facilities that are required to stay open from liability issues. Trump previewed the order earlier today during an Oval Office spray with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, saying that\u00a0he expects to sign an executive order later in the day related to the food supply chain. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that\u2019ll solve any liability problems,\u201d Trump told reporters.\u00a0 The President also underscored that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of supply. It\u2019s distribution.\u201d \u201cIt was a unique circumstance because of liability,\u201d he added. ##Food Supply## Students at the University of California and the California State University System\u00a0are suing for the balance of their campus fees, according to court papers filed in Los Angeles and Oakland yesterday. The suit filed in Los Angeles against the California State University System said: \u201cCSU's decision to transition to online classes and to instruct students to leave campus were responsible decisions to make, but it is unfair and unlawful for CSU to retain fees and costs and to pass the losses on to the students and/or their families.\u00a0Other higher education institutions across the United States that also have switched to e-learning and have requested that students leave campus have recognized the upheaval and financial harm to students and/or their families from these decisions and have provided appropriate refunds.\u201d Similarly, the Oakland filing against the University of California says it \u201chas improperly retained monies paid by Plaintiff and the other Class members for these fees for services that are no longer available,\u201d according to the filing.\u00a0 Campus fees include health facilities, health services and student activities. Most students were not eligible for stimulus funds, said the suits. Campuses have been closed to students since March and moved to distance learning platforms for over 700-thousand students. School is in session through at least May for both university systems. ##West## Alabama Gov.

The justices will ask their questions in order of seniority, with Chief Justice John Roberts going first, the court announced today. Under normal circumstances, the court is considered a \"hot bench,\" with justices frequently interrupting each other and the lawyers before them. Roberts has had to step in as a kind of traffic cop at certain times. Under the new system that will be in place for arguments beginning on Monday, a justice will get the chance to exhaust his or her line of questioning before the next justice begins.  If there is time, according to a release from Kathy Arberg, the Court's public information officer, any remaining questions can be asked after the first round is over. Arberg said the changes were made in \"keeping with public health guidance in response to Covid-19.\" In all, the court will hear 10 cases over the next two weeks. The most noteworthy cases fall on May 12 concerning President Trump's bid to shield his financial records from release. The sessions will mark the first time in history that members of the public will be able to listen in to arguments real time. Keep reading. New Jersey Gov.

Kim Reynolds said Monday her state is doing everything it can to keep the meat supply chain up and running. \u201cThis is essential, critical to keeping the food supply chain moving, \u201c she said at her daily news briefing. When asked about recent outbreaks in meat processing facilities in her state, Reynolds pointed to the fact Iowa produces 10% of nation\u2019s food supply. \u201cWe have a role and obligation from our farmers, to our processors, to our supply chain to continue to feed the world and keep food on the plate,\u201d the governor said.\u00a0 Reynolds said the meat processing plants are working with the state to ensure proper safety measures are being taken to protect both the workers and the supply chain.  She said temperature checks, mandatory face masks, partitions, new attendance policies, and social distancing are being used to keep workers safe. Reynolds issued a warning if processing plants are closed down saying, \u201cWe're going to really be dealing with some significant issues going forward not only from a food supply, protein effort, but the cost of food as well.\u201d ##Food Supply## ##Midwest## There has been at least\u00a0994,625\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

The epidemiological model provides projections for 40 countries and every US state. Out of the 12 states in the US Southeast \u2013\u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia \u2013\u2013 the model\u2019s projections for Georgia are the only projections that assume statewide social distancing will be relaxed starting on May 1 to reflect Gov. Brian Kemp's orders to reopen the state.  The projections for the state of Georgia show the highest uptick in deaths per day between May and August for the region. With the assumption of relaxed social distancing, the model predicts that the number of Covid-19 deaths per day in Georgia will jump from 32 people dying on May 1 to a projected 63 people dying per day by August 4.\u00a0 Currently, a total of 995 people have died from Covid-19 in Georgia, according to the model, and it projects that number could climb to 4,691 by August 4.\u00a0 The projection for total deaths in the state provides a range of estimates between 1,686 deaths on the lower end to up to 15,620 deaths on the higher end. ##South## President Trump said Tuesday that his administration is working with airlines to conduct temperature checks and coronavirus tests on international passengers coming into the United States. Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that the US is \u201csetting up a system where we do some testing and we\u2019re working with the airlines on that, testing on the plane, getting on the plane.\u201d The President also said his team is \u201clooking at\u201d and will \u201cprobably\u201d require testing and face masks on international flights. \u00a0 The President claimed he did that \u201cwith China\u201d and Europe, but coronavirus tests haven\u2019t necessarily been administered to passengers from those areas traveling into the US Health screenings, including temperature checks, have been conducted on international travelers. At one point, the President raised the possibility of travel restrictions on Latin America but appeared to back off. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state needs to prioritize testing for frontline essential workers for the coronavirus.  He added that New Yorkers need to \"protect and respect\" them. \u201cThey do have a higher rate of infection because they are putting themselves in harms way and we want to make sure they have the testing so we have an earlier alert system,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor said that essential workers make sure everyone is protected, \u201cthey have to be at the top of the list.\u201d Nonessential businesses in Massachusetts will stay closed until May 18, Gov. Charlie Baker announced today at a news conference. \u201cWe are extending the timeline for all nonessential businesses to keep the physical workplaces and facilities closed to all workers, customers and the public until May 18,\u00a0and the state-at-home advisory also remains in place during this time,\" Baker said. Baker said the ban on gatherings of 10 or more people will also be extended until May 18. \u201cI know pushing these dates back a couple of weeks is probably not what many people want to hear,\" he said. In the meantime, the state is forming a reopening advisory board to create a phased plan. The state's lieutenant governor and the secretary of housing and economic development will lead the board, the governor announced.\u00a0 The advisory board has been asked to produced their plan by May 18. ##Reopening## President Trump said Tuesday he would \"check\" on whether he received warnings about the coronavirus outbreak during briefings in January and February. \u201cI\u2019d have to check. I would have to check. I want to look to the exact dates of warnings,\u201d Trump said during a meeting with Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Oval Office.\u00a0 He cited the China travel ban as a sign he took the threat of the virus seriously. \u201cBut I can tell you this, when I did the ban on China, almost everybody was against me, including Republicans. They thought it was far too harsh, that it wasn\u2019t necessary. Professionals, Republicans and Democrats: almost everybody disagreed, and that was done really early,\u201d he said. Some background: The Washington Post reported Monday that Trump received more than a dozen warnings about the coronavirus outbreak in daily briefings in January and February, but continued to downplay the virus' threat and severity.\u00a0 Citing current and former US officials, the paper reported that the warnings came in the President's Daily Brief, a summary of intelligence reports from the various agencies, which tracked the virus' proliferation, highlighted China's inaccurate characterization of the disease and its death toll and warned of potential widespread ramifications related to the pandemic. Officials told the Post that the President, who frequently forgoes the briefings and has become impatient with the summaries of the brief he now receives a couple of times per week, did not seem to absorb the warnings. They added that focused efforts tracking the virus were on par with prior instances of monitoring security threats, including active terrorism and international clashes. An official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which manages the briefing, told the Post that \"the detail of this is not true\" and declined to explain or elaborate. CNN has reached out to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for comment.\u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will be measuring two key data points while reopening businesses in the coming weeks. One of the \"danger signs\" is if hospitals exceed 70% capacity. \"Don't overwhelm the\u00a0hospital system,\" Cuomo said at a news conference today. \"If you ever hit 70%, you can expect\u00a0the number to go up for the next\u00a0two weeks as people who just got\u00a0infected actually get ill and some of\u00a0them come into the hospital.\" The other sign the state will monitor during reopening is the rate of transmission of the virus. \"If the transmission rate hits\u00a01.1d that's what they call\u00a0outbreak.\u00a0That means it is going to spread\u00a0much, much faster,\" he said. Cuomo said if the transmission rate \"hits 1.1, that means you\u00a0are in trouble.\" See more: ##Northeast## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at least 335 people across the state died of coronavirus yesterday.  \"This is the worst news,\" Cuomo said of reporting the daily death count. \"Every day, I think maybe today's the day the nightmare will be over, but it's not.\" Monday's death total is down slightly from the 337 people who died on Sunday.

If you must go out, please make as few trips as possible and wear a mask to protect not only yourself, but others. We need all Pennsylvanians to continue to heed these efforts to protect our vulnerable Pennsylvanians, our health care workers and frontline responders.\u201d ##Northeast## Waffle House\u2019s CEO Walt Ehmer said that he has seen \u201ca little bit more traffic\u201d in restaurants that have opened limited in-dining operations, but people are still largely practicing social distancing guidelines.\u00a0 \u201cEven though we didn't really\u00a0reopen, we just added some\u00a0limited in-house dining to what\u00a0we were already doing, I'm\u00a0seeing so far that our\u00a0customers\u2026are\u00a0still behaving according to what\u00a0they've been instructed to do in\u00a0terms of social distancing,\u201d Ehmer told CNN\u2019s John King.\u00a0 Ehmer said Waffle House, which is headquartered in Georgia, is following CDC and state guidelines on reopening. They\u2019ve cut down capacity in restaurants so people can sit at least six feet apart, he said.\u00a0 Waffle House is famous for almost never shutting down its restaurants. It typically only closes during major disasters like hurricanes or storms. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u00a0even coined the term \"Waffle House Index\"\u00a0to measure the effect of a natural disaster on an area.\u00a0 Ehmer noted that customers have been placing to-go orders for the past six weeks. \u201cPeople do seem to value a\u00a0little bit of a sense of\u00a0normalcy and a hope that maybe\u00a0better days are ahead, but it is\u00a0definitely a gradual process\u00a0that will take us to the next\u00a0stage of this,\u201d he said.\u00a0 But Ehmer said that while he is pleased with unemployment help given to Americans so far, he is uneasy about the long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cLong-term is what we're pretty concerned\u00a0about at this time in terms of\u00a0what will the ultimate impact to\u00a0the economy be with so many\u00a0people being out of work for so\u00a0long,\u201d he said.\u00a0 As the meat supply chain and hog farmers continue to suffer from Covid-19 outbreaks in processing plants, an economist at Kerns & Associates, the firm employed by the National Pork Board, estimates more than\u00a01.5 million hogs will have to be destroyed in the coming weeks as farmers simply run out of space to maintain them.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We're going to have to destroy those pigs to get them out of the way,\" Dr. Steve Meyer told CNN Tuesday.\u00a0\"And next week we will have some more.\"\u00a0 Meyer said there were around 600,000 hogs last week that did not go to slaughter and around 900,000 this week.\u00a0Meyer estimates the cost of raising each hog is around $140, a total loss if the animal doesn't go through processing.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The real issue is that nobody wants to be here and do this,\"\u00a0Meyer said of the toll the pandemic is taking on\u00a0hog farmers.\u00a0\"There's no way to plan for something like this. You can't plan for a once in a 100 year event.\"\u00a0 CLARIFICATION: The headline has been updated to clarify that an economist from the National Pork Board estimated 1.5 million hogs will have to be killed in coming weeks. ##Food Supply##\u00a0 There are at least\u00a0989,357 cases of coronavirus in the US, and\u00a0at least\u00a056,386\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States, The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases. \u00a0 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on a phone call with reporters today that Democratic leaders came to the judgment late Monday that the House will\u00a0not come back next week, a reversal from the plan they advanced yesterday afternoon. Hoyer said the attending physician's points that the numbers in D.C. are still going up and the surrounding area is a hotspot, as well as the fact that the next coronavirus relief package will \u201cnot be definitely ready to be considered next week\u201d contributed to the decision. ##Stimulus## All New York City high school seniors are going to be celebrated in a citywide virtual graduation, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced this morning. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do one big citywide virtual graduation ceremony, we\u2019re going to do one big celebration of New York City\u2019s high school seniors.

He said that the virus has \"globally spread\" \u2014 noting that we are starting to see cases in parts of Southern Africa. \"It's not going to disappear from the planet,\" he said. Fauci said that if the virus returns later this year, \"how we handle it...will determine our fate.\"  He said that if \"countermeasures\" that are being discussed are executed, \"we should do reasonably well,\" otherwise the country could see a \"bad fall\" and \"bad winter.\" Farmers are facing a crisis as meat plants close during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Iowa pork producer and president-elect of the National Pork Producers Council Jen Sorenson.\u00a0 \u201cWe're in complete peril.\u00a0\u2026 We need help, we need direct\u00a0payments, we need support, and\u00a0we need indemnification and\u00a0support as we look to\u00a0euthanizing a large number of\u00a0hogs, which is inevitably what\u00a0we have to do if we can't keep\u00a0our plants open,\u201d Sorenson said.\u00a0 As plants producing 33% of the nation\u2019s pork supplies have closed, Sorenson said farmers are on the brink of bankruptcy. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re in a downward spiral.\u00a0If we don't do something\u00a0quickly, we'll see further\u00a0consolidation and loss of\u00a0thousands of family farms,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto.\u00a0 Three of the nation's largest pork processing plants have been temporarily shut down because of coronavirus concerns among workers. House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson said yesterday that farmers now have a huge overstock of pigs that must be euthanized \u2014 estimating that there are roughly 60,000 to 70,000 pigs a day that could be killed in order to make space at farms.\u00a0Peterson said the country could see pork shortages in grocery stores by next week, but Sorenson says the biggest crisis is on farms right now. \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe crisis is our hogs that are backing up, they have no\u00a0place to go, we have new hogs\u00a0coming into our barns. And we\u00a0need a solution, we need our\u00a0county, state and federal, local\u00a0officials to work together and\u00a0wrap our arms around the food\u00a0chain and try and keep these\u00a0plants open,\u201d she said.\u00a0 ##Food Supply## Concerns about the health of the US meat supply continue to grow, as more meat processing plants shut down due to coronavirus outbreaks.\u00a0 Hog farmers are sounding the alarm: They have too many hogs and nowhere to send to them due to the plants closing down. House Agriculture Chairman\u202fCollin\u202fPeterson\u202fsaid Monday that farmers will have to kill roughly 60,000 to 70,000 pigs a day in order to make space at farms. What this means for shoppers: Experts still tell CNN that, while the food supply chain is vulnerable, consumers will be the least impacted \u2014 a lack of variety and some temporary scarcity in certain types of meat, but do not predict not an overall \"meat shortage\" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with Occupational Safety and Health Administration, published new, interim guidelines on Sunday advising meat and poultry processing facilities to create a Covid-19 assessment and control plan, along with suggestions for what that plan should include.\u202f The CDC said that these workplaces should identify an on-site coordinator who is responsible for Covid-19 assessments and control planning, be knowledgeable in virus prevention, while also making sure all employees know how to contact them with any\u00a0concerns. \u00a0##Food Supply## The US military field hospital at the Javits Convention Center in New York City will end its mission \"on or about May 1,\" according to the Defense Department. \"The Javits Center is in the process of\u00a0transferring patients to local hospitals with an expected completion of mission\u00a0on or about May 1,\" the Pentagon said in a statement Tuesday. About the hospital: The field hospital at the Javits Center has treated 1,093 patients and is still treating 74 of last night, according to Northwell Health spokesperson Terry Lynam. The Army Corps of Engineers converted the Javits Center to treat coronavirus patients but the field hospital along with the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort have been operating significantly below capacity as the absence of hospital bed space has not been as much of a challenge as was originally anticipated.\u00a0 Hundreds of military medical personnel have been assigned to the Javits field hospital.\u00a0 The USNS Comfort has already discharged its last patient and is expected to depart New York in the coming days. \u00a0##Northeast## US stocks opened higher for a second day in a row as investor confidence remains high in this earnings-heavy week.

Steve Mnuchin criticized big companies \u2013 including the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team \u2014 taking loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, and warned that others following suit will undergo a full audit.\u00a0 \u201cI never expected in a million years that the Los Angeles Lakers, which, I\u2019m a big fan of the team, but I\u2019m not a big fan of the fact that they took a $4.6 million loan. I think that\u2019s outrageous and I\u2019m glad they returned it or they would have had liability,\u201d Mnuchin said during an appearance on CNBC.  He continued, \u201cAnd let me just say I\u2019m going to be putting out an announcement this morning that for any loan over $2 million, the SBA will\u00a0be doing a full review of that loan before there is loan forgiveness, so we will make sure that what was the intent for taxpayers is fulfilled here.\u201d He later described that review as a \u201cfull audit of every loan over $2 million,\u201d noting that the \u201ccertification was very clear in saying that if people had other sources of liquidity they could not take this loan.\u201d Mnuchin said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that a \u201csmall number of companies,\u201d including Shake Shack and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, have \u201ccreated a lot of publicity.\u201d \u201cI think it was inappropriate for most of these companies to take the loans. It was clear that there was a certification,\u201d he said, noting that Treasury is \u201cencouraged\u201d by the businesses that have paid those loans back. ##Stimulus## As of this morning, more than 988,469 coronavirus cases have been reported in the US, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. Here's the latest news on the pandemic: Texas reopening this week: Gov. Greg Abbott said yesterday he will allow\u00a0his stay-at-home order\u00a0to expire on Thursday. The move comes after other states across the country have already started reopening, including Georgia,\u00a0Michigan and Alaska.\nOther states are waiting: Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he won't lift his state's stay-at-home order until after May 15. New York state also won't lift restrictions this week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said \u2014 the earliest the state will begin its first phase of reopening is May 15, but only in places that have seen a 14-day decline in hospitalizations.\nNew York cancels election: New York has become the\u00a0first state to outright cancel its presidential primary\u00a0due to the pandemic. The state's board of elections says, with the candidates basically already set, it would be nothing more than a risky \"beauty contest.\"\nWhere the US stands on testing: The White House has\u00a0released new guidelines on coronavirus testing, but they\u00a0appear to fall short of the level recommended\u00a0by the nation's top disease experts. The goal of the initiative is to help each state reach the ability to test at least 2% of its residents, with a focus on vulnerable populations and emergency workers. However, experts have said the\u00a0US should be testing millions of people a day\u00a0in order for the country to start getting back on its feet. ##South## ##Northeast## ##Testing## ##Reopening## Personal finance journalist Jean Chatsky appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d to discuss some of viewers\u2019 most pressing financial concerns during the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of her answers: Q: Do you have a choice between PPP [Paycheck Protection Program]\u00a0and unemployment wages? Are\u00a0you allowed to receive both?\u00a0 A: You can't double dip.\u00a0You can't take both, so it\u2019s up\u00a0to you whether you want to go\u00a0back to work if your employer\u00a0receives PPP and offers you your\u00a0job back. But from the\u00a0employer's perspective, they\u00a0need to use this money for\u00a0payroll. And so if you're not going to come back\u00a0to work, they can use that money\u00a0to hire somebody else.\u00a0 Q: I have a retirement pension from\u00a0the state that I applied for due to\u00a0start next month.\u00a0Since my retirement is tied to\u00a0the market, am I in danger of\u00a0losing it?\u00a0 A: It is definitely a concern,\u00a0however, these pension plans\u00a0have other ways of meeting their\u00a0obligations.\u00a0They will either increase\u00a0contributions or they'll reduce\u00a0spending in other ways. Q: Are businesses that\u00a0reopen in Georgia and other\u00a0states still entitled to those\u00a0PPP funds?\u00a0Are they going to generate\u00a0enough business considering the\u00a0new spacing rules and the fact\u00a0that the majority of us won't\u00a0venture into their businesses\u00a0until science says it is safe? A: The purpose of this PPP\u00a0money is to sort of bridge the\u00a0employers through this time\u00a0period. \u2026 So they are still eligible. \u2026 If you're a business that\u00a0has not been able to put your\u00a0application through, don't wait.\u00a0We do expect that this money\u00a0will go quickly.\u00a0 Q: What rights do landlords have\u00a0during this pandemic? A:\u00a0If your mortgage is backed by\u00a0Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you\u00a0are eligible for several months\u00a0of forbearance, several months\u00a0of pushed- off payments during\u00a0this period of time.\u00a0If you're not backed by Fannie\u00a0or Freddie, talk to your lender.\u00a0\u2026 Your tenants still owe you this\u00a0money.\u00a0They may need some sort of\u00a0payment plan, they may need some\u00a0sort of leniency, but they do\u00a0owe you the money and you should\u00a0try to work out the terms under\u00a0which they're able to pay it.

Birx said the White House is working \"to ensure that we are ready for anything that happens in the fall. Whether it's testing, whether it's PPE, whether it's ventilators, whether it's a complete surveillance system that understands that we have to track for asymptomatics as well as symptomatic individuals. All of those pieces need to accelerate -- expand to be ready for the fall.\" \u00a0Let\u2019s just say it: The second launch of the Paycheck Protection Program didn\u2019t go smoothly\u00a0yesterday.  In fact, lenders and small business owners who had hoped the kinks had finally been worked out in the intervening weeks since PPP ran out of money, ended the day exasperated.  System-wide slowdowns left lenders taking to Twitter to vent frustrations. Small business owners who have been waiting weeks to get their applications approved, may still be in the queue after some small lenders failed to get even a few dozen applications uploaded.\u00a0 The Scene:\u00a0Within minutes of the program launching, sources were sending screenshots of errors received by lenders trying to upload applications to the E-TRAN system. The system kept freezing.\u00a0 \u201cIt seems like the pace of this is slower than the last time around,\u201d one industry source said.\u00a0 The numbers:\u00a0The Small Business administration touted yesterday afternoon that it\u00a0\u201cprocessed more than 100,000 PPP loans\u201d and those loans came from \u201cmore than 4,000 lenders.\u201d So what happened? By the end of the day, SBA argued \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d was responsible for glitches to the system lenders use to upload applications. The agency also noted that unlike the last time they launched PPP, this time they set a pacing mechanism in the system to ensure that no one lender \u2013 especially larger institutions\u2013 could enter thousands of applications within an hour and outpace smaller banks.\u00a0What that meant was if a bank was trying to enter more than 350 applications within an hour, the system would time out.\u00a0 But even smaller banks said they were struggling to get in many applications at all.\u00a0 One source who represents community banks said they heard from bankers around the country who\u2019d spent weeks getting their files ready for the relaunch only to be stalled at the start.\u00a0 Several industry sources pushed back that the pacing mechanism was the sole reason the system was unreliable. Instead, arguing the issue was that SBA\u2019s system was simply not equipped to handle the volume despite multiple promises to congressional aides and industry that the system would be ready to go this time. A reminder about SBA:\u00a0It is worth repeating, SBA has never in the history of the agency lent the kind of money they are responsible for getting out the door right now.  It would normally take SBA\u00a0years\u00a0to lend\u00a0the more than $660 billion they are kicking out right now. Aides on the hill hearing about frustrations from constituents and bankers are keenly aware of the fact that the system has not worked smoothly, but at the end of the day, the entire U.S. Senate present to vote for the program, did. ##Stimulus## Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that while the nation's capital is not ready to open businesses yet, she supports members of Congress returning to DC because they are essential workers. \u201cWe know essential workers and\u00a0hospitals and grocery stores,\u00a0our sanitation workers are all\u00a0reporting to work because they\u00a0have essential jobs to do.\u00a0And the work of the Congress is\u00a0essential, especially now,\u201d Bowser told CNN\u2019s John Berman. \u201cWhen workers need relief, when\u00a0small business need relief, and\u00a0when state and local governments\u00a0need relief.\u00a0So the Congress has to get to\u00a0work.\u201d\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate would reconvene on May 4. Nearly a third of senators are age 70 or older.  In March, when House members were required to return to Washington in person for the historic stimulus bill vote, many expressed concerns over traveling. Bowser said she assumes some congressional employees will be able to telework from home.  Having private retailers such as CVS and Walgreens offer Covid-19 testing will help\u00a0bring\u00a0more tests to communities across the United States,\u00a0White House coronavirus task force response coordinator Dr. Deborah\u00a0Birx said during an appearance on Fox & Friends this morning. \"We've really understood that you've got to bring the tests to the community \u2014 whether it's drive-thru, whether it's walk-thru \u2014 the community has to feel like tests are available to them,\" Birx said. \"Just having it at hospitals or clinics was not going to be enough and so that part of this is critically important to expand community testing.\" Some background: On Monday,\u00a0CVS\u00a0Health announced plans\u00a0to offer drive-thru testing at up to 1,000 locations across the country by the end of May, with the goal of processing up to 1.5 million tests per month.\u00a0 Walgreens on Monday announced plans to expand its drive-thru testing locations to 49 states and Puerto Rico.\u00a0Walgreens has already opened 18 drive-thru testing locations across 11 states. \u00a0##Testing## Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said people should wear masks during social gatherings to avoid the spread of coronavirus. \"If there is virus in the community, or you are gathering people from different areas of a state where there may be still residual virus and no virus, if everybody wears a face mask, then you are protecting the other person,\" Birx said during an appearance on Fox & Friends this morning. \u00a0She added: \u201cWe know that talking, singing, certainly sneezing and coughing can pass the virus onto others. And because you can pass it when you are asymptomatic, people don't know that they are infected.\" \"Since you don't know if you are one of those, really everyone needs to in those kind of social gathering situations, as long as there is virus still in the community,\" Birx said.\u00a0 Black barbers across America are engaging in a heated debate over whether cities and states should lift coronavirus social distancing mandates that have forced many of their businesses to close indefinitely. African Americans as a group are\u00a0suffering the most\u00a0during the Covid-19 pandemic, with\u00a0higher infection and mortality rates\u00a0than the general population. Barbers say black business owners, like many of them, are also disproportionately hurting financially from government shutdowns meant to stem the virus' spread. Several shop owners said they can't afford to remain closed much longer.\u00a0 In African-American culture, barbershops are much more than places to get a haircut. Many are marketplaces where local vendors sell their wares and community centers where people gather for hours to discuss\u00a0politics,\u00a0sports\u00a0and the news of the day. The unique folkways and stature of black barbershops have been the subject of\u00a0iconic movie scenes,\u00a0Hollywood film franchises, even an\u00a0HBO television series. \"There's probably all kinds of barbershops talking about what's going on with our government right now,\" Mike Knuckles, 45, a barber at Select Cutz in Grand Prairie, Texas, told CNN Business. \"If you lose a barbershop that's been in the community 30 years and has a tradition and respect in the community, that's huge.\" Damon Dorsey, 59, president of the American Barber Association, a barber advocacy group whose estimated membership of 3,000 is about 30% black, said he has spent weeks talking with worried barbers nationwide since the pandemic began. They're concerned about limiting the spread of Covid-19, but also want to \"get back to making money,\" Dorsey told CNN Business. \"All are struggling with the uncertainty of the moment,\" he said.

Hoping to get a better idea of how many people have previously been infected with the virus, officials in the US have begun asking asymptomatic residents to test for antibodies. Los Angeles County will expand coronavirus testing Tuesday to include delivery drivers, rideshare drivers, and taxi drivers even if they're asymptomatic, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. \"These are folks that are on the frontlines, helping us get to where we need to go, helping us have food delivered to our homes,\" he said. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said 1,000 asymptomatic residents will undergo diagnostic and antibody testing by Friday to evaluate exposure to the virus in the city.\u00a0 And beginning Tuesday, health workers will start visiting randomly selected homes in two of Georgia's largest counties to conduct antibody testing through blood samples. \"This investigation will help us estimate the percentage of people in the community who have been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19,\" the Georgia health department said. In New York, about 15% of the 7,500 people who have been tested in the state's antibody study have tested positive, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.\u00a0 But the former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told medical news website Stat on Monday those tests are \"not ready for prime time.\" \"As we learn whether that means you are protected in the future, there could be value in that,\" Dr. Richard Besser told Stat reporter Helen Branswell about the tests, but \"the science isn't there yet to be able to say what those tests mean.\" \"I worry that people will get a false sense of security and they can change their behavior based on the results of that test, or have a false sense of concern if it's a test that isn't detecting protections that they may actually have,\" Besser said. Read the full story here. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state will begin to reopen Friday,\u00a0but a Texas judge hopes residents will not take him up on it. \"Just because something can be open doesn't mean it should be open,\" Dallas County\u00a0Judge Clay Jenkins\u00a0told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"Burnett Outfront.\"  \"And just because something is open doesn't mean you should go there.\" Abbott issued an executive order Monday allowing businesses like retail stores, malls, restaurants and theaters to reopen Friday with occupancy limited to 25%. The order supersedes local orders.\u00a0 \"Now it's time to set a new course, a course that responsibly opens up business in Texas,\" Abbott said. \"We will open in a way that uses safe standards -- safe standards for businesses, for their employees as well as for their customers. Standards based upon data and on doctors.\" But Jenkins said the best way to open the state's economy was to keep residents safe -- and that the order went against safest practices advised by scientist and experts. \"What we know is that when you look at other science-based plans, movie theaters are not one of the first things that open,\" Jenkins said. \"And so, I think it's going to be incumbent on the residents here to use good, smart decision-making.\" Though Jenkins and local politicians cannot override Abbott's order, the judge's said he will look for ways to institute rules to keep residents and employees safe within the reopening.

He was wrong. \"We have a wily little girl,\" said Kaplan, who lives in Washington, D.C. \"At 9 months old, she managed to open a childproof \u2014 in air quotes \u2014 bottle of acetaminophen.\" When Kaplan found her, she was smeared in a sticky mess from putting the gel caps in her mouth. \"Acetaminophen, we came to learn, is very dangerous and dose-dependent,\" said Kaplan, who called poison control then headed to the closest emergency room. Kaplan's daughter was fine, but accidental poisoning is a serious problem for American kids.\u00a0 More than 300 children\u00a0are treated for poisoning each day in emergency departments across the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On average, two of those kids will die.\u00a0 As Americans spend more time at home trying to safeguard their families against Covid-19, accidental poisonings are on the rise. And some experts believe the spike is due to the very same cleaning products parents are using to protect their families from infection. Read the full story here. Contact tracing has helped slow or stop previous epidemics, such as the SARS and Ebola outbreaks. But it's never been more critical \u2014 or more challenging \u2014 than in this fight against coronavirus.\u00a0 Here's what we know about contact tracing: What is contact tracing? It tracks down anyone who might have been infected by a person who was recently diagnosed so those contacts can quarantine themselves and prevent further spread.\u00a0\nWhy it matters: Researchers say the US -- or really any country -- can't safely reopen without significant amounts of contact tracing and testing.\u00a0\nHow it works: Contact tracers use a variety of methods, including phone calls, emails and social media messaging to reach out to people who might have been in contact with someone infected with Covid-19. When contacts are notified, they aren't told who was diagnosed with coronavirus. \"To protect patient privacy,\u00a0contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed to a patient\u00a0with the infection,\" the CDC says. \"They are not told the identity of the patient who may have exposed them.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday he will allow\u00a0his stay-at-home order for the Lone Star State\u00a0to expire on Thursday. The new order,\u00a0which supersedes local orders,\u00a0will allow businesses like retail stores, malls, restaurants and theaters to reopen Friday but limits occupancy to 25%. The order will also allow libraries and museums to open. Abbott noted that he wants barbershops, salons, gyms and bars open \"as soon as possible\" and expects them to open no later than mid-May. Touting Texas' plan as the \"result of tremendous input,\" Abbott said the state will not mandate but \"strongly recommend\" that everyone wear a mask as businesses reopen. \"Now more than ever, Texans must remain committed to safe distancing practices that reduce the spread of Covid-19, and we must continue to rely on doctors and data to provide us with the safest strategies to restore Texans' livelihoods,\" he said. \"We must also focus on protecting the most vulnerable Texans from exposure to Covid-19. If we remain focused on protecting the lives of our fellow Texans, we can continue to open the Lone Star State.\" ##South##"], "Language": false}
