That praise came nearly a month after the country informed the World Health Organization about the virus. When asked by CNN's Jeremy Diamond on Saturday about his previous praise, Trump said he thought the country could have warned other nations sooner than it did. \"Because China has worked very hard,\" he said. \"China was transparent at that time but when we saw what happened, they could have been transparent much earlier than they were.\" He went on to criticize what he said was China's waiting to tell the US. \"They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could have said that,\" he said. Trump said that when he first realized how bad the virus could be he \"started doing the closings,\" referring to the country's denying entry to people who had visited China in the two weeks before they sought entry into the United States in early February."], "Language": false}
