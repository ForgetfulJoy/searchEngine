Coronavirus\u00a0 The US now has the most recorded coronavirus cases of any country, surpassing Italy, China and other hard-hit nations. At least 82,100 people have been sickened in the US, and global cases have surpassed the 500,000 mark. In New York City, makeshift morgues have been set up outside hospitals for the first time since 9/11 in anticipation of more coronavirus deaths. However, in a White House briefing, President Trump touted the US' alleged success at battling\u00a0the outbreak and contradicted advice and warnings from top doctors and state leaders. Meantime, other countries are bracing for the next wave of the crisis. Ethiopia has released 4,000 prisoners to prevent the spread of the virus. Doctors in Venezuela, which has been largely spared so far, are preparing for the worst because of the country's vulnerable economic and political state. And\u00a0China is closing its borders to most foreigners as it attempts to recover from the outbreak and prevent a second one from starting.\u00a0 2. Health\u00a0 Doctors are learning more about what the coronavirus does to patients, and it's not good. Lung damage from inflammation caused by the virus could be permanent, even in relatively healthy patients. A new study also revealed heart injury\u00a0among coronavirus patients is linked to a higher risk of death, though it's not clear if the virus causes such damage. With\u00a0the onslaught of illnesses, some hospitals are considering making\u00a0changes to do-not-resuscitate policies. The concern is that performing CPR on a Covid-19 patient could\u00a0expose health care workers to the virus. Meanwhile, doctors are railing against a statement from\u00a0White House trade adviser Peter Navarro\u00a0that the media is overhyping the need for personal protective equipment in hospitals. A shortage of masks and\u00a0other supplies\u00a0has been a huge concern for health care workers as they look to protect themselves and other patients from the outbreak.\u00a0 3. Israel\u00a0 Israel's political deadlock may be coming to an end. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political rival, Benny Gantz, has been elected speaker of the Israeli Parliament and voiced his desire\u00a0to form an emergency national government.\u00a0The surprise move suggests Gantz is willing to serve in a government led by\u00a0Netanyahu, who has faced numerous political and legal challenges in the last few months. It\u00a0has also prompted outrage from some of Gantz's followers, who feel betrayed. Israel has had three general elections in the span of a year, but\u00a0attempts to form a majority government have all fallen short. But with Gantz's decision, there's a possibility his political following could unite with Netanyahu's Likud party to get the job done.\u00a0 4. Venezuela The Trump administration has taken\u00a0sweeping actions against Venezuela's top leaders that are sure to mark a low point in relations between the US and the ailing socialist state. The Justice Department announced narco-terrorism and other criminal charges against Venezuelan President\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and senior leaders of his government, and the State Department\u00a0designated Maduro and top current and former officials of Venezuela's military, parliament and judiciary under its Narcotics Rewards Program, offering multimillion-dollar bounties. US prosecutors say Venezuela's leaders enabled the trafficking of cocaine to the United States. Venezuelan leaders say\u00a0the Trump administration's actions are a political distraction from the US coronavirus crisis.\u00a0 5. Russia\u00a0 Mild tensions have been simmering\u00a0on the high seas between Russia and the United Kingdom. The British Royal Navy said it's seen an unusual amount of activity from Russian warships in the English Channel and North Sea. In response,\u00a0nine Royal Navy ships were charged with shadowing seven Russian ships for more than a week\u00a0as they passed by the British Isles. This kind of thing happens occasionally, and British forces are sometimes forced to respond to Russian aircraft or ships as they get near the UK's borders.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE If you wear contact lenses, you should probably switch to glasses to reduce virus transmission risk You know how you're not supposed to be touching your face right now?
