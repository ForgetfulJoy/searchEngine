We had some lovely tributes and history was made\u00a0with \"Parasite's\" big win. The celebration of actors by their peers puts us one step closer to the biggie - the Academy Awards. Way to go \"Parasite!\" The South Korean movie became the first foreign language film to ever win the statue for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture. The film has been garnering tons of buzz and accolades this awards season. Could this be a foreshadow of the Oscars? \u00a0 Ren\u00e9e Zellweger won the outstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role for her portrayal of Judy Garland in the biopic \u201cJudy.\u201d The actress offered words of gratitude for being an actor. \u201cAnd to this community, y'all have taught me so much along the way and I am so grateful to you,\" she said. Finally she paid tribute to Garland. \"Judy Garland, 50 years later your community is thinking of you tonight,\" she said. \"This is for you.\"  The \"Joker\" magic continued Sunday night. Joaquin Phoenix won outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role for his performance as the villain. He used his acceptance speech to pay tribute to his fellow nominees, Christian Bale, Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver and Taron Egerton. It gave Phoenix a chance to joke about constantly losing out on roles years ago to DiCaprio when they both were young actors.  Peter Dinklage thanked his wife and the people of Northern Ireland during his acceptance speech for best male actor in a drama series. The \"Game of Thrones\" actor was up against Sterling K. Brown in \"This Is Us,\" Steve Carell in \"The Morning Show,\" Billy Crudup in \"The Morning Show,\" and David Harbour in \"Stranger Things. \"I would like to thank the people of Northern Ireland, who put up with us for nine years,\" he said about the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d filming location. \"I would also like to thank everyone at table nine and ten and beyond cause we put up with each other for nine years.\" Lastly, he thanked his wife. \"Finally and most importantly I would like to thank my wife, who put up with me for more than nine years, but lived in a place far away from home, but made it home cause we were together,\" he said.  Sam Rockwell won as lead actor in a limited series for his role as Bob Fosse in\u00a0\"Fosse/Verdon.\" He thanked his costar, Michelle Williams, along with the rest of the cast and crew for being extraordinary.

The actress, who played Rachel Berry on the show, tweeted a pic of herself cradling her actor trophy.  \"Watching the #SAGawards like.....,\" she wrote.  When Leonardo DiCaprio was 13 years old, his father took him to see \"Midnight Run,\" starring Robert De Niro. \"As the lights went down he looked at me and said, 'If you really want to be an actor and get into this profession, if you want to understand what great acting, is watch that man on screen,'\" DiCaprio recalled before presenting De Niro with the 2020 SAG Life Achievement Award. The room erupted into cheers and a standing ovation as DeNiro took the stage. \"We as actors don't do it all alone,\" De Niro said. \"We can't do it all alone. We depend on each other for collaboration in our work and support and fellowship both on screen and off. And for that I am so grateful.\" De Niro got a bit political. \"There's right and there's wrong and there's common sense and there's abuse of power,\" DeNiro said, quoting himself from a recent interview. \"And as a citizen I have as much right as anybody - an actor, an athlete a musician or anybody else -- to voice my opinion. And if I have a bigger voice I'm going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power.\" The prolific actor has been\u00a0outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump. He also said he would treasure the award because it comes from his fellow actors. \u00a0 Jennifer Aniston won a statuette for her starring role in \"The Morning Show.\" \"You know, I was thinking back to when I was a little girl. ... I would tape 'Laverne & Shirley,' 'Happy Days' and others. I would listen to them. I would think one day I am going to do that,\" she said as she accepted her trophy. Aniston said she was \"grateful,\" and went on to thank \"every actor in this room.\" She also thanked Reese Witherspoon with an \"I love you girl,\" and said even though her Hollywood career had been long, she felt \"special to be up here.\" At the end of her speech, Aniston recognized her sometime co-star Adam Sandler, who stars in the film \"Uncut Gems:\" \"Adam Sandler, your performance is extraordinary, your performance is real.\" Michelle Williams has had seven nominations over the years, and Sunday night she won her first award. She took home the outstanding performance by a female actor in a television movie or miniseries for her role as Gwen Verdon in \"Fosse/Verdon.\" Among her thank you's included her daughter, Matilda, whose father is the late actor, Heath Ledger. \"Matilda, it's one thing to be completely honest as an actor,\" Williams said. \"It's another thing to be completely honest as a human being. And that's who you are and how you live. You teach me just by being you. I love you and I'm coming home.\" \"Parasite\" is red-hot this awards season. The cast appeared at the SAG Awards to introduce their movie as one of the nominees for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture.

Brad Pitt is getting more lovable as awards season goes on.  \"Have to add this to my Tinder profile,\" he said, accepting the award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role in a motion picture. Pitt's charm was on full display.  \"A guy who gets to get high, take his shirt off, and doesn\u2019t get on with his wife, it was a big stretch,\" he joked. Pitt then seriously thanked the crowd, saying \"I love our community so much.\" \"We know pain, loneliness, grace,\" he said, adding that he's been \"banging away at this thing for 30 years.\" It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. The cast of the hit Amazon series took home the award for the second time and one of its stars, Alex Borstein, was shocked. According to her, she voted for the cast of \"Fleabag\" to take home the trophy. \"Honestly, this makes no sense,\" said Borstein, before dropping an \"F-bomb\" which was barely bleeped out.

It's been the most beautiful dream.\"  \"Well, thanks,\" is how Tony Shalhoub kicked off his SAG Awards speech for winning outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series. He thanked his fellow nominees, saying, it's \"a joy to know you, a privilege to work alongside you.\" Shalhoub, who won for \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" was nominated along with Alan Arkin and Michael Douglas for \u201cThe Kominsky Method,\" Bill Hader for \u201cBarry\" and Andrew Scott for \u201cFleabag.\" This year's Screen Actors Guild Awards began as they do every year, with actors sharing  memories of their career ending with \"My name is (fill in the blank) and I am an actor.\" Christina Applegate\u00a0started with a story about how she got her SAG card in the 1970s for an independent film. \"I don't remember what it was, but it was the '70s and everyone was really, really high,\" she said.
