Speaking to lawmakers on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the 2020 Summer Olympics is a possibility. This is the first time Abe has changed his staunch public position that the Olympics will start July 24 as scheduled. In recent days, a growing number of countries and athletes have called for the games to be postponed, while Canada said today it will not send any teams. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) responded Sunday, saying a final decision on postponement will be made within four weeks, due to the vast complexities of rescheduling a massive global sporting event like the Olympics. \u201cThe IOC\u2019s decision is along the lines of what I said before, of holding the event in its complete form. If that becomes difficult -- and thinking first about the health of the athletes -- we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games,\" Abe said, speaking at the budget committee in Japan\u2019s upper house of parliament.  \u00a0##Daily Life## ##Business## Canada won't be sending teams to the Olympics this year.

The government of Italy has made a direct appeal to Defense Secretary Mark Esper for US military aid in combating coronavirus, according to a US defense official.  Specifically, Italy's defense minister has asked Esper for critical medical equipment like masks and ventilators as Italy has nearly 60,000 confirmed cases and has had more than 5,000 deaths. The Italian government has requested that US military personnel stationed in Italy assist Italian authorities by providing medical personnel and field hospitals in support of Italian troops already responding to the crisis there. Esper recently made the Defense Department\u2019s stockpile of masks and ventilators available to civilian hospitals in the US to help respond to the pandemic. The military has activated units capable of constructing field hospitals to help relieve the burden on civilian hospitals. The Italian plea for assistance from its NATO ally comes as the Russian military has made a very public effort to provide the Italians with assistance, using military aircraft to fly in medical personnel and equipment.

A key procedural vote to advance a massive stimulus package failed Sunday afternoon as Senate Democrats lined up against it.  The vote was\u00a047-47.\u00a0Lawmakers needed to clear a 60-vote threshold to succeed. Democrats have been expressing concerns over the legislation as it stands throughout the day as talks continue and the vote, originally set for 3 p.m. ET, was delayed until 6 p.m. as Democrats dug in against it and to allow for more time for negotiations.

Jay Inslee for a federal disaster declaration Sunday, Inslee said in a tweet Sunday. Inslee asked for the declaration in a letter to President Trump Friday to unlock a host of additional federal assistance programs for Washington residents affected by coronavirus, according to a statement from Inslee's office.  \"We appreciate that the federal government has recognized the severity of the public health emergency in Washington state by declaring a major disaster and taking the first step toward additional assistance for Washingtonians,\" Inslee said. \"However, today\u2019s declaration does not unlock many forms of federal assistance we have requested to help workers and families who are badly hurting. We will continue working with our federal partners to deliver the full suite of disaster assistance that is sorely needed in our state, such as expanded unemployment benefits for workers who lose their paychecks as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.\" The declaration grants the state\u2019s request for assistance with crisis counseling and training to address the impact of the outbreak on the mental health of affected Washingtonians, Inslee's statement read. Other disaster assistance programs requested in Inslee\u2019s letter remain under review by the White House, the statement read, including expanded unemployment assistance and basic food benefits.

Canada\u2019s Health minister was more blunt and suggested the government\u00a0will use all measures in its \"tool kit,\" including fines, if returning travelers do not abide by orders to stay home. \u201cWhen we say that you must stay at home for 14 days that means you stay at home for 14 days, you do not stop for groceries, you do not go visit your neighbors or your friends, that you rest in your house for 14 days, no exceptions,\u201d said Patty Hajdu, Canada\u2019s Health Minister.

The male officer will remain at home until medically cleared, Boyle said. Public health officials are looking into contact tracing from this infected officer, Boyle said. The department, which has about 2,000 officers, continues to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first responder guidelines with regards to protocols in the wake of the virus. Boyle said the health and safety of department members is the utmost priority. A health care system in New York is no longer allowing visitors,\u00a0including partners,\u00a0for its patients about to give birth, citing coronavirus risk. \"For the time being, we really do need to exclude all visitors, including partners, for women admitted in labor,\" Dr. Dena Goffman, chief of obstetrics at Columbia University Medical Center, said Sunday during a daily leadership briefing for the NewYork-Presbyterian health care system.  Goffman described the move as a \"very difficult decision and not one taken lightly.\" NewYork-Presbyterian has also made the decision to test all women in labor who are admitted to labor and delivery units for Covid-19, regardless of symptoms.  Goffman said there had been a number of patients with little to no symptoms upon admission, and others with atypical symptoms, who were later found to test positive for the novel coronavirus. Moreover, \"many symptoms of labor and of pregnant women really mimic some of the symptoms of Covid-19,\" including fatigue and shortness of breath, she added. \"As a result, these women were not identified by our usual screening, infection prevention and control, or testing processes, and therefore our practices\u00a0for protection for Covid-19 were not implemented. In this case, many staff members were exposed,\" Goffman said.\u00a0 Testing women in labor, she added, would allow doctors to isolate newborns who may have been exposed to the virus, thus preventing outbreaks in neonatal ICUs and well-baby nurseries.\u00a0 Absent in-person visitors for these patients, Goffman said the hospital system was looking into ways to allow families to participate virtually in childbirth,\u00a0perhaps through\u00a0tablet computers. \"We recognize that we will need to provide additional support for moms, as well as mom and baby pairs, as they're in the hospital through the duration of their stay,\" she said. ##Health## The United Kingdom's 1.5 million most vulnerable citizens are being told to stay at home for the next 12 weeks to help shield them from coronavirus. Communities Minister Robert Jenrick says authorities will be writing to those who\u2019ve been identified to offer them assistance to maintain social distancing during the outbreak. This includes providing food, so they don\u2019t have to leave the house\u00a0 The announcement was made at Sunday\u2019s daily press briefing at Downing Street, alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Johnson said the measures being announced today were foreshadowed in the government\u2019s response plan. \u201cThis shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out, to save life,\u201d Johnson said. ##Daily Life## Spain\u00a0plans to extend its state of emergency for another 15 days, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced Sunday, as the number of\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0deaths soars in the country. Sanchez addressed citizens in a televised briefing on Sunday, after meeting with health and security officials. He said he expected Parliament to approve his request to lengthen the order, which has been in place for over a week. By the numbers: It comes with the country's death toll from the virus accelerating. The country's health ministry said on Sunday that another 394 had died in just the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities to 1,720. ##Health## German Chancellor Angela Merkel is going into home quarantine immediately, after a doctor who gave her a vaccination on Friday has tested positive for coronavirus, Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert announced in a press statement on Sunday. Seibert also stated that the chancellor will continuously be tested for coronavirus because a test at this early stage would not be reliable.\u00a0Merkel will continue her full workload from her quarantine, Seibert added. Earlier Sunday: Germany has implemented a \"contact ban\" rather than a full nationwide lockdown in an effort\u00a0to curb the spread\u00a0of coronavirus, Merkel said. Merkel said in a press conference Sunday that the country would\u00a0toughen measures and\u00a0\"reduce contact\u00a0with people as much as possible.\" \u00a0 NewYork-Presbyterian performed more than 500 tests for the novel coronavirus Saturday, and 50% came out positive. \"That's very high,\" Chief Operating Officer Dr. Laura L. Forese said in a leadership briefing Sunday. Forese said the hospitals had 558 Covid-19 inpatients,\u00a0and about 1 in 5 are receiving\u00a0ICU care. That number \"is a snapshot. It's changing probably as I'm speaking to you today,\" she said. \"We have many more who have been sent home, either Covid-positive tested, or presumed to have that.\" Some context: Like other health care systems around the country, NewYork-Presbyterian is not able to test every patient for Covid-19, citing a shortage of swab kits. Of nearly 30,000 cases in the United States, more than\u00a015,000 are in New York state, including more than 9,000 in New York City. \u00a0##Health## Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a tweet sent from his official account.  \u201cHe is feeling fine and is in quarantine. He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person,\" the tweet said. Sen. Paul\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff Sergio Gor expanded on the tweet saying in a statement, \u201cHe (Paul) expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time. Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Paul.\u201d More context: Paul had part of his lung removed last year as a result from the assault by his neighbor which also broke five of his ribs.

Merkel extrapolated on the ban in a\u00a0phone conversation between herself and the 16 German state premiers on Sunday, saying a contact ban will be implemented,\u00a0meaning no more than two people would be allowed to interact with each other \u2014 with the exceptions of families and people living together.  Merkel said that \"a\u00a0minimum\u00a0distance of 1.5 to 2 meters\" should\u00a0be adhered to and\u00a0meetings in groups are now unacceptable and will be sanctioned if not adhered to.\u00a0 Further, Merkel added that restaurants, as well as hair salons, and tattoo\u00a0shops will also be shut down. Merkel said these measures would be in\u00a0place\u00a0for at least two weeks. \u00a0##Daily Life## People in the United Kingdom are being told to stay at home and to not travel to remote communities, amid growing worries in the regions over the spread of coronavirus.\u00a0 Fiona Hyslop, Scotland\u2019s tourism secretary, told the BBC that tourists could \u201ccompromise the health\u201d of people living in rural areas, including the Scottish Highlands and Islands.

The Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday it had started flying 100 doctors and virologists, along with disinfection equipment, to the country. The first Il-76 aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces departed Sunday from Moscow\u2019s Chkalovsky military airfield with Russian military specialists and equipment aboard, the Russian military said in a statement.\u00a0 Nine Il-76 transport aircraft, with military doctors, special vehicles for disinfecting and other medical equipment on board, will land today at the military airport of Pratica di Mare, the Italian defense ministry added.\u00a0 Some context: This news came a day after telephone conversations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the defense ministers of both countries.  According to a Kremlin readout, Russia agreed to provide assistance on Italy\u2019s request, including protective equipment, KAMAZ truck-mounted units used for disinfection, medical and other equipment. \u201cItaly is not alone in this challenge,\u201d Italian Defense\u00a0Minister Lorenzo Guerini said after speaking with Russian Defense\u00a0Minister Sergei Shoigu by phone late Saturday, according to a readout. \u201cI want to thank Russia for the help it is giving our country to overcome this emergency.\u201d The view from Russia: Putin\u2019s move came in for some criticism at home. Russian officials have faced questions about shortages of protective equipment for medical workers, and the city of Moscow is scrambling to complete a medical facility for coronavirus patients. Anastasia Vasilyeva, a doctor for Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and leader of the Alliance of Doctors union, wrote a sardonic post on Twitter about Russia\u2019s move to help Italy.\u00a0 \u201cIs Putin our president at all?\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe have a shortage of doctors, they do not have protective equipment, they are sewing masks from gauze.

The division is setting up field hospitals in Broward and Miami-Dade counties to increase capacity. Each will be able to accommodate 250 people, according to Moskowitz.\u00a0 They have procured 3,000 beds, which includes ICU beds, in order to increase the capacity available to respond to the coronavirus, Moskowitz said. There are also 300 nurses on standby and 300 medics with the National Guard available to respond as needed, Moskowitz said. ##Health## House Speaker Nancy Pelosi departed the a meeting in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office and said there is no deal yet on the coronavirus economic stimulus bill, adding that the House will introduce its own bill \u2014 something that could significantly draw out the process to finalize the legislation.

It lists 18 doctors who have passed away since March 11; of those, 15 are from Lombardy, the hardest-hit region and the epicenter of\u00a0Italy\u2019s outbreak.  It is unclear if each of the doctors listed was directly battling the coronavirus outbreak and treating the infected. Among those doctors who have died is Marcello Natali, 57, who died on March 18, according to the federation website.\u00a0\u00a0 Natali, as reported by local media, had been a vocal critic of the initial Italian government response to the outbreak, and also sounded the alarm on the dearth of medical supplies. Also among the doctors who have died is Francesco Foltrani, 67, who died on March 19. The federation says Foltrani had in-person contact with a local retirement home where many of the elderly residents were known to have contracted coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0 By the numbers: There are approximately 53,578 confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy, according to\u00a0the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center.\u00a0 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert,\u00a0said\u00a0there is a problem with people trying to separate himself and President Trump when it comes to their approaches to the coronavirus crisis, but that \u201cthere isn\u2019t, fundamentally, a difference there.\u201d\u00a0 Fauci,\u00a0in an interview on CBS \"Face the Nation,\" was asked about\u00a0the President\u2019s tweet on Saturday in which he stated that a mixture of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin could help people suffering from Covid-19.\u00a0 \"HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine ...\" Trump tweeted on Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0 When asked on Sunday\u00a0where the President got that information, Fauci said Trump had heard about this combination of drugs from anecdotal reports. \u201cI am not disagreeing with the fact that, anecdotally, they might work but my job is to prove definitely from a scientific standpoint that they do work,\u201d Fauci said, adding that people trying to separate himself and the President, but they approach these issues from differing standpoints; the President from a \u201chope, layperson standpoint\u201d and Fauci from a \u201cscientific standpoint.\" ##Health## There are at least\u00a029,235\u00a0cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States, according to CNN Health\u2019s tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the country through public health systems.

Pelosi spoke as she arrived at a critical meeting of the top four congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to finalize the bill, which has been the subject of intense negotiations on the Senate side for days.\u00a0 The Senate did consider input from Pelosi and House committees who worked through Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to provide it. On Saturday, Schumer signaled he might accept the bill.\u00a0But on Sunday morning, Democratic sources said they had uncovered numerous problems with provisions dealing with aid to workers and loan assistance to businesses.\u00a0 What could happen next: If Pelosi doesn\u2019t support the bill, Senate Democrats could stall action on the bill by blocking a procedural motion set for a vote Sunday afternoon. The House Speaker also could change it when the bill goes to the House if it passes the Senate Monday, as Senate Republicans and the White House want.\u00a0 That could slow getting out the much-needed aid to workers and businesses.\u00a0Pressure would mount \u2014 from Wall Street to Main Street \u2014 on Pelosi and House Democrats if they don\u2019t act quickly. President Trump says Ford, General Motors and Tesla were given a \u201cgo ahead\u201d to make ventilators and other metal products \u201cFAST,\u201d according to a tweet\u00a0he sent Sunday. \u201cGo for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?\u201d Trump tweeted.

Hospital beds and medical supplies continue to be an issue for the state, Cuomo added. Hospitals have about 53,000 hospital beds available now, but could need around 110,000, he said. Cuomo is calling on the federal government to nationalize medical supply acquisitions because states are competing with each other and price gauging is happening.\u00a0 New York state has 15-times more cases than other states, according to Cuomo. ##Health## The federal government should nationalize medical supply acquisition to help states across the US fighting the coronavirus pandemic, said New York Gov.

He went on to urge the President Trump to sign an order to mobilize the military to distribute ventilators and to have manufactures making ventilators at maximum production.\u00a0\u00a0 The Defense Production Act: The Federal Emergency Management Agency describes the act as \"the primary source of presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the US industrial base to support military, energy, space and homeland security programs.\" An executive order issued Wednesday afternoon indicated that the President will use the act to obtain \"health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of Covid-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators.\" The order also states that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar may consult with other agency heads to determine \"the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials ... in the civilian market, for responding to the spread of Covid-19 within the United States.\" ##Health## The massive emergency aid package being negotiated on Capitol Hill has grown to roughly $2 trillion as bicameral, bipartisan leaders are set to come together to try and clinch a final agreement, according to two people directly involved in the talks. The fate of a the final proposal will be in the hands of the four congressional leaders and Treasury Sec. Steven Mnuchin, all of whom will gather in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office on Sunday. The scale of the package \u2013 which has grown by over a trillion dollars over the course of several days and by more than $500 billion just during Saturday\u2019s negotiations alone, the people said \u2013 underscore the recognition of the urgency brought on by the accelerating spread of the coronavirus pandemic that has all but shuttered the American economy over the last week. Behind the scenes: Republicans staff worked through the night \u2013 some in the office past 3 a.m., people told CNN \u2013 to draft the legislative language to reflect the status of the negotiations between the four bipartisan working groups that have been cloistered in closed Senate hearing rooms for hours over the course of an urgent last few days. Republicans have expressed optimism that a deal is in the offing, but there are still a handful of hurdles that have kept Democratic negotiators from fully signing on.  That said, lawmakers on both sides acknowledge that a deal is imperative as soon as possible, with a procedural vote to move forward on the package set for Sunday afternoon and a final vote to pass any agreement set for as soon as Monday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that lawmakers have a \"fundamental understanding\" that a deal has been reached to pass a massive stimulus bill to a staggering economy reeling from the coronavirus as soon as Monday. \"I do think it will get done. We've been working around the clock in the Senate with Republicans and Democrats. I've been speaking to (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell, (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer, the (House) Speaker and I think we have a fundamental understanding and we look forward to wrapping it up today,\" said Mnuchin, in an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Mnuchin explained that the bill, which could cost trillions, has several components: small business retention loans, which will give small business two weeks of cash flow to retain their employees and keep up with overhead; direct deposits, which would be approximately $3,000 for the average family of four; enhanced unemployment insurance, which was a sticking point in the talks; and a \"significant package\" of $4 trillion in liquidity, working with the Fed, to support the economy and broad-based lending programs. Mnuchin said the bill is structured based on a 10-to-12 week scenario, and that if in 10 weeks coronavirus is still ravaging the country, the administration would return to Congress to ask for more. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker complained that states are competing against each other for key supplies and there needs to be more federal coordination on these goods, he said in an interview with on CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. As a result, everyone is competing against each other jurisdictions are paying higher prices, Pritzker said. \u201cWe need millions of masks and hundreds of thousands of gowns and gloves and the rest. And unfortunately, we're getting still just a fraction of that. So we're out on the open market, competing for these items that we so badly need and we're succeeding in some ways. but we still need more,\u201d Pritzker said. ##Health## The Detroit Metro Times started the year on a celebratory note, having reached its 40th anniversary. This week, its staff was slashed from 16 to eight employees after its parent company Euclid Media Group announced layoffs across its seven newspapers as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the country, crippling businesses in its wake. Music editor Jerilyn Jordan was told in a conference call on Wednesday that she was one of the remaining employees but staying on would mean a 10% pay cut.\u00a0 \"Everything changed in a week,\" Jordan told CNN Business. \"For a minute, I could comfortably glide into work and know that I had some concert announcements to post. But then it became writing about cancellations and postponements and rescheduling. Now that's come to a halt because guess what? Let's just assume everything was f**king canceled.\"\u00a0 With local events canceled and restaurants and bars shuttering to crack down on the gathering of large crowds, local newsrooms have not only had to change their coverage. They have also lost out on crucial ad revenue and places to distribute their print products.  These changes have an outsized effect on alt-weeklies which rely heavily on advertising from events and local businesses. \"I think I'm a fairly good salesperson, but to be able to convince someone to run an ad for an event they're not having is beyond my capabilities,\" Jeff vonKaenel, president, CEO and majority owner of the News & Review newspapers in Sacramento, Chico and Reno told CNN Business. \"Now businesses where I normally distribute papers are closed so it's not going to work. There was essentially no revenue stream and no effective way to get out the paper.\" ##Business## Unemployment in Israel surged to 16.5%, the country's Employment Service said in a statement Sunday morning, up from around 4% before the coronavirus outbreak began.  More than 500,000 workers registered for unemployment benefits with the Employment Service in March alone. The Employment Service noted that the rate of registration has slowed, but it cautioned that this may simply be the end of the first major round of layoffs from the tourism industry. As the economic slowdown hits other sectors of the economy, the rate of registration may increase again, officials warned.\u00a0 A doctor in France died from coronavirus on Saturday night, the country\u2019s health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran has announced. The minister added: \u201cThis is a first, as far as I know.\u201d Medical professionals in France have been battling a rising number of coronavirus cases. The number currently stands at 12,475, with 450 confirmed deaths. V\u00e9ran did not give any details about the deceased. The people of Andalusia, Spain's most populous region, are among the most gregarious in the world. There are a ridiculous number of bars and cafes per capita, and as the weather warms\u00a0Andalusians\u00a0begin the evening paseo, wandering the narrow streets and watching the world go by over a beer and tapas. But not this year. Easter week -- Semana Santa -- in Andalusia is arguably more important than Christmas, a time for candle-lit parades, the caminos de pasion, to celebrate the Virgin Mary and the resurrection of Jesus. Centuries-old floats, held aloft by 20 men or more, lurch through the streets and the air is heavy with incense. Now, they are canceled. The authorities are promising Easter celebrations will happen, but in September. Fernando Alcala Zamora, a young journalist in my hometown of Priego de Cordoba, says the change of lifestyle is utterly alien to Andalusians. \"I think quarantine or 'social distancing' are terms that contradict the very definition of how we relate with each other and enjoy our days, of who we are, so it's a big challenge for many,\" he said. Read more from the lockdown in Andalusia here. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has been in meetings with health and security officials on Sunday morning, as Spaniards prepare for a possible extension of their country's state of emergency. Sanchez is expected to address the nation in a televised speech later on Sunday. It comes with the country's death toll from the virus accelerating. The country's health ministry said on Sunday that another 394 had died in just the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities to 1,720. \"There are hard\u00a0days\u00a0ahead,\" Sanchez said in a televised briefing on Saturday. \"We have to get ready from a\u00a0physiological\u00a0and emotional\u00a0standpoint.\u00a0We have to get to the end of next week strong, very strong.\u00a0The risk is everywhere.\" Spain has been locked down and placed in a state of emergency since Friday March 13. The period was initially expected to last 15 days, but cases in the country continue to soar as that deadline approaches. Emergency hospitals have been set up across the country, while residents have been urged to stay indoors and normally busy streets are deserted. Almost 25,000 cases have been reported in total, with a drastic spike of 5,000 new cases reported on Saturday. \"Spain\u00a0is among the most-affected countries in Europe and in the world,\" Sanchez said on Saturday, adding that the worst is still to come. In an effort to strengthen\u00a0Spain's response to the health crisis,\u00a0Sanchez announced the national production of\u00a0masks, ventilators and tests. Meanwhile,\u00a0the government has bought 640,000 reliable ratified fast tests, which will soon be 1 million, and within the next few hours 1.3 million masks will be handed to health personnel and patients, Sanchez said. Health officials in Hong Kong have confirmed another 44 cases of the novel coronavirus bringing the city-wide total to 317. Out of the 44 new cases, 29 had recent travel history to countries in Europe as well as North America, according to Dr Chuang Shuk-Kwan of the Center for Health Protection. The 44 new cases represent the second largest single-day increase, after 48 cases were reported on Friday. Of the 317 confirmed cases in the city, 100 patients have been discharged from hospital. Of the remaining patients still being treated in hospital, one patient is in critical condition. The gates outside the centuries-old chapel in the shadow of the old World Trade Center were padlocked as rush hour descended on Lower Manhattan's desolate streets. \"In care for our neighbors, parishioners, clergy, and staff, St. Paul's Chapel is canceling services and events until further notice due to the Coronavirus,\" read signs outside the Episcopal church on Thursday, referring visitors to online services. The\u00a0historic chapel, built in 1766,\u00a0narrowly escaped being destroyed when the Twin Towers, across the street, collapsed on\u00a0September 11, 2001.\u00a0It became known as \"The Little Chapel that Stood.\"  After the terror attacks, it provided refuge to tired rescue and recovery workers, who rested on its wooden pews. Notes, cards and other mementos to the dead sprouted for months from those wrought iron gates, now shuttered by the pandemic. Nearly two decades after 9/11 forever changed New York City and the world, the coronavirus pandemic has upended day-to-day life in unprecedented ways -- disrupting schools, travel, entertainment, work and commerce. \"For me, in New York, it reminds me of 9/11, where one moment, which was inconceivable, just changed everything, changed your perspective on the world, changed your perspective on safety,\" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, during one of his daily briefings on the mushrooming number of coronavirus cases. Read more here. In the summer of 2008, an elderly psychic who claimed she started receiving premonitions at age 5 published a book that contained an ominous prediction. \"In around 2020, a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments,\" it said. \"Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.\" The prediction faded from public memory and the book's author, Sylvia Browne, died in 2013. But the coronavirus pandemic has brought new attention to Browne's book, \"End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World.\" It's shot up to number 2 on Amazon's nonfiction chart, and physical copies are now selling for hundreds of dollars. Government and public health officials have issued all sorts of guidelines to help people protect themselves against the spread of Covid-19. But there's another contagion that experts seem helpless to stop: The plague of prophets warning that the coronavirus is a sign we're at the \"end of days.\" Read more here. The number of coronavirus cases in Germany has increased by 1,948 in the past 24 hours to 18,610, according to the country\u2019s agency for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute. That jump represents a 12% increase on Saturday\u2019s figures. Meanwhile, the number of deaths has increased by eight to 55. The German government is considering a nationwide lockdown to combat coronavirus. Last week, two German states -- Bavaria and Saarland -- imposed state-wide restrictions to try to contain its spread. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet state premiers later on Sunday to discuss further measures. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that the country's NHS risks becoming \"overwhelmed\" by the coronavirus outbreak and that the situation in Britain is just two or three weeks behind Italy. \u201cThe numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating. We are only a matter of weeks -- two or three -- behind Italy,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe Italians have a superb health care system. And yet their doctors and nurses have been completely overwhelmed by the demand. The Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing. \u201cUnless we act together, unless we make the heroic and collective national effort to slow the spread -- then it is all too likely that our own NHS will be similarly overwhelmed,\" Johnson said. \u201cThat is why this country has taken the steps that it has, in imposing restrictions never seen before either in peace or war.\u201d Johnson\u2019s statement was released on Mother\u2019s Day in the UK. He is urging people to stay away from their mothers because of the virus \u2013 and instead ring them or video call them. Just a few days ago, however, Johnson himself said he hoped to see his own mother. Iran\u2019s supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused any form of American aid for Iran's citizens on Sunday, claiming the US might be planning to use medication against Iran. \u201cMaybe the medication provided is also another tool to aggravate that disease, so we can never trust you,\u201d\u00a0Khamenei, considered the highest authority in Iran, said, without evidence, in\u00a0a speech delivered on Iran\u2019s national TV for the annual Persian new year. He added it was \"very strange\" that the US is offering the country medication. \"The US has shortages, they are facing acute shortages in terms of preventive tools,\u201d Khamenei added. Every year, Khamenei appears in person to give the speech in the Iranian city of Mashhad. This year the speech was delivered remotely. Iran is the worst-hit country in the Middle East with more than 20,000 cases and 1,500 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The past few weeks have shown that even the\u00a0world's wealthiest and most powerful\u00a0are as likely to contract the virus as anyone else. However, less attention is being paid to the most vulnerable members of society -- those in poverty, people living on the breadline and the homeless. The problem reached a crunch point in the UK,\u00a0which has dramatically increased its response to the virus outbreak\u00a0this week. Food banks that provide a lifeline for some of the\u00a0estimated 14 million in poverty\u00a0are running low on volunteers, many of whom have been forced to self-isolate, as well as food itself, which is in short supply following panic-buying. People working on the frontline in homeless shelters told CNN their worst nightmares were already coming true, with at least one facility forced to close after one of its users died from COVID-19. Most of the people in that shelter are now sleeping rough and may have come into contact with virus carriers. The UK's homelessness problem: The situation is equally bleak for the UK's homeless population. Shelter, a non-profit that provides support for the UK's homeless population, estimates that the number of people sleeping on the streets\u00a0has risen 165% since 2010. That date is important. It's the year the UK went from having a center-left Labour government to a center-right Conservative-led administration. And in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, it embarked on policies that radically cut state spending. Read more analysis from Luke McGee here. Today, India is attempting the world\u2019s biggest social-distancing exercise. But for now, it will only last for 14 hours.  Why is it happening? It's the latest attempt by the government to stall the rapid spread of Covid-19. It could also indicate that the government is testing the waters on whether an official curfew could actually be imposed across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has kept up a steady stream of tweets since early morning, asking citizens to stay inside. \u201cThe steps we take now will help in the times to come. Stay indoors and stay healthy,\" he said. What India is like today: Social media has been flooded with photographs of famous locations that are usually packed with people -- but today are eerily quiet. In India, where staples like rice, flour and pulses have always been bought in bulk, the fear of a lockdown has spurred people to double their usual orders.  Local grocery shops -- seen on every street -- continue to operate but with fewer items on their shelves. Modi has asked Indians to hold a salute to medical professionals, emergency health care provider and government officials on Sunday evening. Millions are expected to ring bells and clap to honor their work. Who will be affected by the 'public curfew': The people who will be most affected are those who depend on a steady daily wage to put food on the table -- including people who work as rickshaw pullers or street hawkers.  This is also a problem for shoppers. In a country where tinned food is almost non-existent, every household is dependent on the local hawkers who push carts piled with vegetables each morning through the neighborhood. What's the bigger picture in India: More than 320 people have contracted coronavirus in India.  In the past few weeks, India has taken unprecedented steps to shut down its borders, cancel visas and ban passengers from certain countries from entering Indian airspace.\u00a0 The United States territory of Guam has reported its first death from coronavirus.  The patient was 68-years-old with underlying health issues that\u00a0were compounded by the novel coronavirus,\u00a0according to the Guam authorities. The patient had no recent travel history. But initial investigations indicated the patient may have contracted it from someone who did have a travel history. According to the press release, the patient was admitted to the Guam Memorial Hospital (GMH) on Sunday, March 15, and remained there in isolation throughout the week.\u00a0 There are currently 14 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Guam, according to authorities. All passengers arriving into Shanghai from abroad will be tested for the coronavirus, Shanghai\u2019s Health Commission announced on Sunday. The measure will apply even to those arriving from areas where the virus is not widespread.  Beijing flights: On Sunday, the government announced that all international flights to Beijing will be diverted to other cities in China starting Monday. Passengers on affected flights will need to clear immigration and customs at their first port of entry. Those deemed healthy will then be allowed to board the same aircraft to fly onwards to Beijing, the government said. The bigger picture: Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, has not reported any new cases for four days in a row.\u00a0 But now there is a new focus in the fight against coronavirus: people bringing the virus into China. China recorded 46 new coronavirus cases on Saturday -- and all but one came from abroad. That brings the total number of imported cases to 314.\u00a0   Europe is one of the worst-hit regions, with a number of countries struggling with large novel coronavirus outbreaks. Here's what has been happening in Europe: Italy reports its biggest one-day jump in deaths: In the past 24 hours, Italy recorded 793 deaths, meaning 4,825 people there have now died from coronavirus, according to the Italian authorities. That\u2019s an almost 20 percent increase on the day before, and is the biggest\u00a0one-day\u00a0spike since the outbreak began. A least 53,578 have contracted the virus in Italy.\nUK numbers pass 5,000: There are now more than 5,000 confirmed cases in the United Kingdom, according to the Department of Health and Social Care on Saturday. That's a rise of more than 1,000 cases in 24 hours. In total, 233 people with coronavirus have died in the UK and 72,818 people have been tested.\nSpanish Prime Minister warns the worst is yet to come: Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez asked Spaniards on Saturday to remain strong, adding that \"there are hard days ahead.\" \"We have to get ready from a\u00a0physiological\u00a0and emotional\u00a0standpoint ... The risk is everywhere,\" he said. \nGermany treats coronavirus patients from France: Germany\u00a0has admitted  patients from the French region of Alsace -- an area which borders Germany. \nBerlin limits gatherings to no more than 10 people: On Saturday, Berlin\u00a0limited gatherings to no more than 10 people. Restaurants in the city can only offer take-out or delivery.\u00a0The city has at least 866 cases of Covid-19 with one death, according to the Robert Koch Institute.\nFrance sees highest jump in deaths: France\u00a0saw its highest jump in deaths from coronavirus since the beginning of the outbreak, according to the Health Ministry on Saturday. France had seen 562 deaths by Saturday -- a rise of 112 from Friday. \u00a0 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a new method to help people check whether they may have symptoms: An online bot nicknamed Clara. The CDC says its bot isn't there to diagnose diseases -- instead, it's intended is to help users make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care. Clara asks a series of questions to establish the level of illness being experienced by the user (or the person they are asking questions on behalf of). For instance, Clara might ask if they are gasping for air or suffering from shortness of breath. It also establishes their location within the US, whether they are in a long-term care facility and if they have been in contact with someone with Covid-19 Recommendations range from calling 911 immediately to staying at home and calling their health care provider within 24 hours. Clara also points to the relevant state's health department for further advice. Read the whole story here.  Colombia has had its first coronavirus death, the country's Ministry of Health confirmed.  The deceased is a 58-year-old taxi driver, who transported Italian tourists in the northern Colombian city of Cartagena.\u00a0 Initially, the patient tested negative for Covid-19. But tests carried out posthumously confirmed his death was caused by the virus. The man's sister has tested positive for coronavirus and is under medical care. As of Saturday evening, Colombia had 210 confirmed coronavirus cases. Terence Lester is placing portable sinks with soap and water where the homeless congregate in Atlanta. \"All the news reports are saying wash your hands,\" Lester told CNN. \"But the homeless population often can't.\" Lester knows the challenges of living on the streets. He was homeless as a teenager and he is currently the executive director of the nonprofit\u00a0Love Beyond Walls, which is dedicated to helping the homeless. But the difficulties the homeless now face with this pandemic are hard for him to fathom. \"I was trying to think of how they will survive,\" Lester said. \"How can they get through this when they can't even wash their hands? So, I decided to start there.\" He found a solution with portable washbasins that are sold for RVs and camping. These sinks have a foot pump to bring water from a 5-gallon tank to the faucet. A soap dispenser is built into each station. The Love Beyond Walls team picks up the sinks daily to clean them and refill each unit with water and soap. The nonprofit is raising money to place more sinks in the city and to ship them across state lines to other homeless communities. Read more about Lester and Love Beyond Walls here.  A Connecticut man who died after a coronavirus diagnosis was given his last rites by his pastor over the phone while his family listened in from quarantine.\u00a0 Cathie Pike told CNN that her husband, Bill Pike, \"led a life of intellectual fascination of the world.\" Calling her departed husband \"simply amazing,\" she said he had the most beautiful last rites thanks to modern communication. \"It was a like a tapestry or quilt of our affections for him,\" she said. The delivery of last rites was made possible after a nurse at Norwalk Hospital agreed to assist. The nurse gathered the Rev. Peter Walsh of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in New Canaan on the phone and then connected Pike's wife and three children to the call from quarantine. The nurse held the phone to Bill Pike's ear as Walsh delivered last rites, which he described as \"the most beautiful litany of prayer.\" The pastor then \"told him I loved him\" and hung up so his family could say their goodbyes. Bill Pike passed away about 10 minutes later. Walsh said it was the first time he ever delivered last rites over the phone. Read the whole story here.  All international flights to Beijing will be diverted to other cities in China starting Monday, amid growing concerns over imported cases of novel coronavirus.\u00a0 Passengers on affected flights will need to clear immigration and customs at their first port of entry. Those deemed healthy will then be allowed to board the same aircraft to fly onwards to Beijing, the government announced Sunday.\u00a0 These rules had already been applied to some Beijing-bound international flights last week, with planes diverted to three nearby cities.\u00a0 Now that policy has been rolled out wider, 12 cities, including Shanghai, have been identified to handle the diverted traffic.\u00a0 The bigger picture: Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, has not reported any new cases for four days in a row.\u00a0 But now Beijing has a new focus in its fight against coronavirus: people bringing the virus  into China.  China recorded 46 new coronavirus cases on Saturday -- and all but one came from abroad. That brings the total number of imported cases to 314.\u00a0  David Bryan, a founding member of Bon Jovi, announced Saturday on Instagram that he tested positive for coronavirus. \"I've been sick for a week and feeling better each day,\" the keyboardist wrote. \"Please don't be afraid!!! It's the flu not the plague.\" Bryan said he has \"been quarantined for a week and will (be) for another week. And when I feel better I'll get tested again to make sure I'm free of this nasty virus. Please help out each other. This will be over soon... with the help of every American !!\" Bryan is also a Tony Award-winning composer and lyricist.\u00a0 He is not the first celebrity to announce a positive coronavirus diagnosis. Others include\u00a0Tom Hanks,\u00a0Idris Elba,\u00a0Andy Cohen\u00a0and several\u00a0NBA players. Health officials in Thailand reported 188 new coronavirus cases Sunday, marking the largest single-day increase since the outbreak began. The country-wide total is now 599 confirmed infections. Seven coronavirus patients are currently in a critical condition, officials said. On Saturday, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration announced new measures, including the closure of shopping malls and amusement parks.\u00a0Restaurants are only allowed to open for takeaways. Pharmacies and supermarkets are excluded from the new measures.  El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced late Saturday that a 30-day nationwide curfew will take effect immediately. Bukele said that one person from each family would be allowed to go out so they can supply their household with food and medicine. The Central American country has three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Who is exempt? \u00a0 People who work in restaurants, public transport, gas stations, security companies, private clinics, finance, hospitals, vets and the media can continue working. Those who work at the Supreme Court and public employees directly linked to emergency care will also be able to continue. The livestock and agriculture sectors will also be able to continue operating, because \"we need to guarantee food security,\" Bukele said. Economic help To alleviate the economic situation, the government will invest $450 million per month to help households that consume less than 250 kilowatts of electricity per month.  \"We are talking about 75 percent of the population that will benefit,\" Bukele explained.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## ##Travel## Japan has raised its travel alert for the United States, urging citizens to not go there unless it is essential. The alert was raised to level two, the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday. Four is the highest alert level.   Meanwhile, the United States is warning its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Japan. The United States has more than 25,000 coronavirus cases, while Japan has just over 1,000 cases.  Australia has more than 1,000 coronavirus cases, and the country is introducing a number of measures to deal with the outbreak. Here's what has been happening in Australia: Sydney's home state shuts non-essential services: New South Wales -- the state where Sydney is located -- will close most services and businesses to try to slow the spread of the virus. Essential services, such as petrol stations, convenience stores and pharmacies, will stay open.\u00a0New South Wales has 469 confirmed\u00a0cases, the highest of any Australian state.\u00a0 A new economic support package: Australia\u00a0has announced a second support package, this time worth $38 billion, to help households and businesses.  Another state gets tough: South\u00a0Australia's Premier Steven Marshall said Sunday that a spike in confirmed cases from travelers entering the state had \"forced our decision to close our borders in South\u00a0Australia.\" But while Marshall called it a border closure, in fact the state is still open -- arrivals will just need to self-isolate for 14 days. The new measures will be \"progressively enforced between now and 4pm on Tuesday.\" Meanwhile, elsewhere:  Northern Territory and the island state of Tasmania require all travelers to self-isolate for 14-days upon entry. Tasmania is offering one-off payments of $250 for individuals, or up to $1,000 for families, required to self-isolate. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## More countries in Africa have started to report their first novel coronavirus cases.

New Zealand has temporarily closed its High Commission in Barbados and its Embassy in Myanmar due to the coronavirus outbreak. Foreign Minister Winston Peters\u00a0announced the moves on Sunday, saying the government had made the decision based on the increasing scarcity of air links in and out of Bridgetown in Barbados and Yangon in Myanmar. The government was also concerned about the pressure Covid-19 was putting on local health systems, Peters said. The staff and their families will be withdrawn from both posts. The closures will be reviewed in one month. Could there be more closures? Peters did not rule out the possibility that more diplomatic posts could be shut. \u201cWe are actively working to sustain our network around the globe and we have every intention to keep the vast majority of New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s 62 diplomatic posts open,\" Peters said.\n\"However, with the rapidly changing health, safety and security situation for staff overseas due to COVID-19, we cannot rule out other temporary closures as a result of the pandemic.\u201d What if New Zealanders in those countries need consular assistance? If you need consular help, you can still reach out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its helpline. Find out more details here.  Australia has announced a second support package worth $38 billion to help deal with the economic impacts of the coronavirus. In a press conference Sunday, local time, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the new package is designed to \"cushion the blow to households as a result of the coronavirus and to support businesses.\"  \"Since the government announced the first stimulus package over a week ago, the global and domestic economic environment has deteriorated,\" he said. He added that the government now \"expects the economic shock to be deeper, wider and longer.\" Who will it benefit? Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the \"safety net package\" includes support for \"sole-trader, retirees and those on income support,\" as well as assistance for businesses to keep employees. The Prime Minister added that the government is providing up to $57,900 to eligible small and medium sized businesses to help them continue operations and pay rent, bills and staff.\u00a0 \"Our focus is on cushioning the blow and providing help to every Australian,\" the Prime Minister said. The Australian government has now injected $109 billion into the economy including the new $38 billion support package announced Sunday, local time.

But now, the parking lot of the stadium home of NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins will be used as a coronavirus screening site, according to the team's website.  The Washington Redskins are working with the Prince George's and Maryland Health Department to turn the lots into a community screening station. And they've already got started. On Friday, the Maryland National Guard put up 10 tents and hand-washing stations in the parking lot. ##Daily Life## The top four leaders of Congress will meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at 11 a.m. on Sunday,  hours before a crucial procedural vote to advance the massive stimulus bill, according to three sources with knowledge of the plans. The meeting is in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office, and also will include House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While negotiators are close to a deal on the Senate side, it\u2019s still uncertain whether Pelosi will get behind it or will seek to make changes to the measure when it gets to the House. What's in the stimulus package? It's not clear yet, but it looks like it will be big. People directly involved in the negotiations tell CNN it could top a cost of $1.5 trillion. Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser to Trump, went even further in estimating the overall scope of the package Saturday, telling reporters it could top $2 trillion. \"The package is coming in about 10% of GDP, it's a very large package,\" Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said. Ten percent of gross domestic product is roughly $2 trillion. Read more about the package here.  ##Business## New York City has now recorded 8,115 coronavirus cases and 60 deaths. About 1,450 people have been hospitalized -- and at least 370 of those are in intensive care. New York State has 12,260 coronavirus confirmed cases and 70 deaths, making it the worst-affected state in the United States. ##Health## A city in New Jersey is raising money for small businesses with the help of the Goo Goo Dolls' frontman.\u00a0 Westfield Mayor Shelley Brindle told CNN she is neighbors with the band's lead singer, John Rzeznik, and decided he would be the perfect person to kick off the new\u00a0\"We Love Local\" fundraiser.\u00a0 The idea is to have a series of porch concerts, and other events, to help raise money for  small businesses affected by social distancing due to the coronavirus. Brindle was inspired by a porch concert the town had for St. Patrick's Day. \"[Rzeznik] is incredibly generous and has always said to me to let him know if there is anything he can do for the town. His preference notably is he would love to raise money for good things,\" Brindle said.\u00a0 \"I said, 'Hey, would you be willing to do this porch performance to support this fundraiser?' and in five seconds he texted back and said 'Yes!'\" The concert was streamed Friday on Facebook Live and Brindle said people tuned in from all over the world.\u00a0 The gig helped raise $25,000 for local businesses.

Of the 46 new cases, 45 were imported, bringing the total number of imported cases to 314.\u00a0 The death toll in Hubei is now 3,144, and the nation's overall death toll stands at 3,261. In total, China has had 81,054 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to NHC.\u00a0 The NHC added that 72,244\u00a0patients in mainland\u00a0China\u00a0had recovered and been discharged from hospital. Major events around the world have been canceled or postponed as the race to contain the\u00a0novel coronavirus\u00a0continues. The cultural sector -- with its numerous fairs, shows and festivals -- has also been significantly impacted. What has been affected: Countless art institutions, museums and galleries have been temporarily shuttered. The Louvre in Paris, which houses the famous \"Mona Lisa,\" is closed until further notice. A blockbuster exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of Italian Renaissance painter Raphael was suspended days after opening in Rome. Organizers have pulled the plug on Glastonbury, the UK's largest music festival, which was celebrating its 50th anniversary. In New York, the lights are out on Broadway, with  performances canceled until mid-April. Fashion's biggest night,\u00a0The Met Gala, has been postponed. Why this is a big deal: Of course, such closures can seem immaterial compared to the public health crisis posed by Covid-19 and its rising death toll. People are getting sick; they are worrying about how to stay safe, access care, look after loved ones or stay in work. But culture, even during the most extraordinary of times, should not be overlooked. Rather, it should be embraced as means for respite, escape and nourishment. For a brief moment, you can lose yourself in the brushstrokes of a centuries-old painting or feel completely immersed at a live concert.\u00a0 At a time when misinformation, polarization and blatant hate are particularly confounding, culture can be humanizing and educational. It's an alternative means by which to digest an increasingly complex and anxiety-fueled world.
