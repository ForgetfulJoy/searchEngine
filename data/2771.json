(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Impeachment\u00a0 The House officially impeached President Trump. Votes for the two articles of impeachment were\u00a0mostly split along party lines, with two Democrats voting against both and one splitting on the two. No Republicans voted in favor of the articles. While all this was going down, President Trump was at a \"Merry Christmas\" rally in Michigan, where he blasted Democrats for the impeachment push. The articles are supposed to go now to the Senate, but curiously, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stalled on the move. Some Democrats want to make sure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agrees to the Senate trial procedures Dems have requested. As the full picture of last night's historic decision comes into focus, you can follow today's live updates and check out these other impeachment resources: \u2022 How are Republicans reacting? One lawmaker said Trump was given fewer\u00a0rights than Jesus before his crucifixion.\u00a0 \u2022 Moderate Democrats who voted for impeachment may\u00a0face a tough political future. Here's what some said about the decision that could cost them their seats.\u00a0 \u2022 Still confused about how we got here? This explainer video will clear it all up before the process moves to the Senate.\u00a0 \u2022 How much do you actually know about the process? For instance, who officially presides over the Senate trial? Take our impeachment quiz.\u00a0 2. Politics It was a busy day in politics even without the whole \"rare and historic day of impeachment.\"\u00a0While the House debated\u00a0and voted,\u00a0Sen. McConnell\u00a0forced a deal with Democrats to expedite 11 federal district judge nominations. McConnell has had a lot of success changing the country's judicial landscape,\u00a0installing\u00a0about 50\u00a0appellate court judges and\u00a0clocking a big win for Trump and his agenda. Speaking of judges, a federal appeals court ruled that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is unconstitutional. The ruling doesn't invalidate the entire law, a longtime political target for Trump.\u00a0But it does trot health care back into the political spotlight. Now, any Supreme Court action on health care will probably be pushed\u00a0until after the 2020 election. 3. Korea\u00a0 The US and South Korea are at stalemate on\u00a0a cost-sharing agreement for US troops stationed in the country. President Trump reportedly asked Seoul to pay roughly 400% more\u00a0to house US troops. The current agreement expires at the end of the year, and another round of talks is scheduled for January. There's worry in Washington that if the two sides don't reach a compromise, Trump could unilaterally start pulling forces from the region. The agreement is just one of the many delicate diplomatic situations tying the US to the Korean Peninsula. North Korea is openly flirting with more long-range missile tests and nuclear activities,\u00a0putting a serious strain on the Trump administration's unusual relationship with the hermit country. 4. Philippines The people accused of planning a massacre that stunned the Philippines' political establishment have been found guilty, 10 years later. A judge found Datu Andal Ampatuan\u00a0Jr. guilty in the killing of 58 people,\u00a0including 30 journalists and relatives of\u00a0a rival gubernatorial candidate, Ismael \"Toto\" Mangudadatu. Several of Ampatuan's relatives were also convicted in what's been called the \"trial of the decade.\"\u00a0Even now, the case has larger implications for the country's political scene. The Ampatuans were backed by\u00a0members of the Philippines police and army, and the government declared martial law after the massacre.\u00a0Today's verdict emboldens\u00a0human rights activists to call\u00a0for an end to localized corruption and militia activity that can be leveraged by powerful families or groups. 5. Obesity It looks like we better get moving: According to a new study, half of Americans will be obese in the next 10 years if we don't work together to solve the problem. The study casts obesity as a social, rather than individual, issue. Health care experts chimed in, saying the predicted rise in obesity would create untold strain on health care spending through the rise of obesity-related health consequences. But there is hope: Experts say there are some big-picture changes we can make, collectively and individually, to improve the outlook. For instance, communities could improve local public transportation systems, encourage walking instead of driving and keep schools open on weekends and during summers to allow access to gyms and swimming pools. Improving access to fresh produce also could have social and health-related benefits.  BREAKFAST BROWSE The reviews are in, and the new 'Cats' movie is ... weird What?!
