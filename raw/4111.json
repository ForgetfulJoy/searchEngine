Local catering company Union Joints carried out the initiative, which was  funded by Eminem and the Marshall Mathers Foundation. Henry Ford Health System, based in Eminem's hometown of Detroit, posted about the gift Tuesday on Twitter, joking that their workers \"lost themselves\" in the meal. Detroit Medical Center also received a donation, funded by Eminem and the Marshall Mathers Foundation.  A publicist for Eminem confirmed the food donations to CNN, and said other area hospitals would be receiving similar meals in the coming weeks. This isn't the first time Eminem has served up \"Mom's Spaghetti.\"  In 2018, the artist partnered up with Union Joints to host a Mom's Spaghetti pop-up stand at  the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which he also headlined that year. \"Lose Yourself,\" released in 2002, is featured in Eminem's semi-autobiographical film \"8 Mile.\" The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003.
