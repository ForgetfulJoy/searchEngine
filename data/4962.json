The first trailer for \"In the Heights\" debuted Thursday, and it's a major production. The film tells the story of a mostly Hispanic neighborhood in New York City and centers around bodega owner Usnavi, played by Anthony Ramos. It also stars Corey Hawkins, Marc Anthony, Jimmy Smits, Melissa Barrera, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Dascha Polanco and Stephanie Beatriz and is directed by Jon M. Chu of \"Crazy Rich Asians\" fame. Judging by the trailer, the movie sticks close to the Tony-winning musical on which it is based. The success of \"In the Heights\" on the Great White Way was a precursor to Miranda's mega-successful \"Hamilton.\"   The Warner Bros. adaptation of \"In the Heights\" is scheduled to hit theaters next summer. Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company."], "Language": false}
