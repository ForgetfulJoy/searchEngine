Coronavirus\u00a0 Life in some parts of the US has come to an utter standstill so the country can reduce the impact of the coronavirus. Disney World and Disneyland are closed. The March Madness tournament that was going to be played without fans? It's canceled now. Major League Baseball has wiped out the rest of spring training and postponed its season. Some cities have banned large gatherings. Millions of students are out of school. Adding to these major disruptions, continued issues with the availability of coronavirus test kits have\u00a0left\u00a0medical professionals and patients confused and concerned. As the virus continues to spread, a slow trickle of public figures are announcing their diagnoses or close contact with the disease. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife has tested positive, and Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham is the latest US legislator\u00a0to self-quarantine after exposure to it.\u00a0Do you have a question or a story about the outbreak?\u00a0Share it with us here. 2. Iraq The US carried out airstrikes\u00a0against multiple\u00a0Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq a day after an attack on a coalition base killed two American service members and one British service member.\u00a0US Defense Secretary Mark Esper officially blamed that attack on Iranian-backed forces, and yesterday's airstrikes were intended to be\u00a0a direct, defensive response. The\u00a0strikes were carried out by manned aircraft and targeted five weapons storage facilities, which US forces hope will\u00a0harm the ability of Kata'ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored Shia militia group, to conduct future strikes against American troops. 3. Election meddling Russian trolls are back and ready to meddle in this year's presidential election, but this time they're coming from an unexpected source. A CNN investigation has revealed that\u00a0part of the meddling campaign has been outsourced to the West African nations of Ghana and Nigeria. The\u00a0trolls are focusing almost exclusively on racial issues in the US, with the aim of deepening divisions and provoking social unrest. Facebook has removed dozens of pages, accounts\u00a0and Instagram accounts (remember, Facebook owns Instagram) in response to the revelations. Some\u00a0Instagram accounts had hundreds of thousands of followers. 4. Homelessness The LA Alliance for Human Rights, a coalition of housed and homeless people, has filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles to require the city to provide beds and shelter\u00a0for thousands more people, plus provide\u00a0services like\u00a0training and\u00a0health care more quickly. The lawsuit alleges Los Angeles is too slow in its response to the growing homelessness crisis. About 60,000 people were considered homeless in Los Angeles in 2019. Job loss and high costs of living are just two factors that have deepened the crisis. Unhoused people are subjected to harassment and displacement, and homeless encampments across the state\u00a0are a source of major controversy and contention. 5. USWNT\u00a0 The president of the US Soccer Federation has stepped down after the organization released a controversial legal filing claiming it wouldn't pay women equally because being a male player requires more \"skill.\" The filing came in the ongoing gender discrimination suit filed by the\u00a0US Women's National Team, which is demanding equal pay.\u00a0Carlos Cordeiro\u00a0said in his resignation announcement that he regretted the wording of the document and called it \"unacceptable and inexcusable.\" US captain Megan Rapinoe\u00a0tore into US Soccer management over the filing and had this message for some young fans:\u00a0\"You are not lesser just because you're a girl.\" BREAKFAST BROWSE Here are 20 other things to do since March Madness is canceled Trash-can basketball, anyone?
