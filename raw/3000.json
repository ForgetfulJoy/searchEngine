According to his prepared remarks, he will say the Trump administration was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic and will warn that the the US will face \"unprecedented illness and fatalities\" without additional preparations. \"Our window of opportunity\u00a0is closing. If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities,\" Bright is expected to say according to his prepared testimony obtained by CNN. \"Without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be darkest winter in modern history.\" What is this about: Bright will testify tomorrow morning before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's health subcommittee after he filed a whistleblower complaint last week alleging he was removed from his post in retaliation for opposing the broad use of a drug frequently touted by President Trump as a coronavirus treatment. Bright will reiterate that he believes he was removed from his post because he\u00a0\u201cresisted efforts to promote and enable broad access to an unproven drug, chloroquine, to the American people without transparent information on the potential health risks.\"\u00a0 Bright is seeking to be reinstated to his position as the head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The Office of Special Counsel, which is reviewing Bright's complaint, has determined there is reason to believe his removal was retaliatory and is recommending he be reinstated during its investigation, according to Bright's attorneys.\u00a0An HHS spokesperson responded that it was \"a personnel matter that is currently under review\" but said it \"strongly disagrees with the allegations and characterizations.\" Expanding on his whistleblower complaint, Bright is expected to testify that he sought to warn his superiors about potential shortages of critical medical supplies earlier this year, but that his \"urgency was dismissed\" and that he \"faced hostility and marginalization from HHS officials\" after conveying his concerns about shortages to a senior White House official, Peter Navarro. \"As I reflect on the past few months of this outbreak, it is painfully clear that we were not as prepared as we should have been. We missed early warning signals and we forgot important pages from our pandemic playbook,\" Bright will testify, according to his written testimony. In his written testimony, Bright also calls for several key steps to improve the federal government's response to the pandemic and head off a spike in cases in the fall, including increasing public education of preventative measures, ramping up production of essential medical supplies and developing a national testing strategy. \u201cThe virus is out there, it\u2019s everywhere. We need to be able to find it, to isolate it and to stop it from infecting more people,\u201d Bright plans to say. \"We need tests that are accurate, rapid, easy to use, low cost, and available to everyone who needs them.\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that his goal is a full reopening of schools in September but added that there will be \u201cdifferent types of options if we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe to open schools fully.\u201d \u201cBut for now with this much lead time my goal is a full reopening with any number of protections in place to give confidence to parents\u2026educators, and everyone who works in schools.\u201d He was asked how schools could be considered safe, particularly with the rise in pediatric inflammatory cases. De Blasio noted that with September still four months away, \u201clet\u2019s not discount the element of time here, what is the world going to look like when you get to July and August, when we will be making the ultimate decisions and they will be based on the facts.\u201d He added that testing and tracing will bring a whole new \u201coffensive thrust\u201d that can change the trajectory of the virus, adding that they do anticipate more testing focused on school and will implement methodologies for keeping people safe including cleaning. ##New York## The US Department of Homeland Security and the FBI released a\u00a0\u201cpublic service announcement\u201d\u00a0this morning warning that China is likely targeting the US response to the Covid-19 crisis, calling it a \u201csignificant threat.\u201d The joint warning from the FBI and DHS\u2019s cyber arm, CISA, noted that \u201cHealthcare, pharmaceutical and research sectors working on Covid-19 response should all be aware they are the prime targets of this activity and take the necessary steps to protect their systems.\u201d The agencies\u00a0outlined\u00a0recommendations for research organizations:\u00a0 \u00a0Assume that press attention affiliating your organization with Covid-19-related research will lead to increased interest and cyber activity\nPatch all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching for known vulnerabilities of internet-connected servers and software processing internet data\u00a0\nActively scan web applications for unauthorized access, modification, or anomalous activities\nImprove credential requirements and require multi-factor authentication\u00a0\nIdentify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity The notification elevates the accusation by the US government that China is taking advantage of the pandemic to carry out significant cyber espionage on critical institutions fighting the virus.\u00a0 Some context:\u00a0CNN has previously reported\u00a0that the administration has pointed the finger at\u00a0China\u00a0for attempting to steal coronavirus research as officials are warning they have seen a growing wave of cyberattacks on US government agencies and medical institutions leading the\u00a0pandemic response\u00a0by nation states and criminal groups. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reviewed the city\u2019s three indicators for tracking Covid-19 progress, saying \u201coverall trends\u201d with regards to hospitalizations, ICU and positive test confirmation continue to be good \u2014 however the most recent results are \u201cnot what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d Here's how the numbers for May 10 and May 11 compare... The daily number of people admitted to hospitals for Covid-19 is up from 51 to 78 \u2013 that number is \u201ca hell of a lot better\u201d than what it was weeks ago but \u201cwe still need to see it go down,\u201d de Blasio said.\nThe daily number of people admitted to ICU\u2019s is up \u201cby a small amount\u201d to 561 from 550, but again, that's \u201chigher\u201d than the city needs it to be, he said.\nThe daily percentage of people who tested positive for Covid-19 is down to 13% city wide, from 14%. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news today,\" he said. \u201cLet\u2019s double down on the things that are working so we can have\u00a0more of the good days and start to string them together and move towards the first steps in our restart,\u201d de Blasio added. ##New York## There are no conversations inside the White House about altering the date of the November general election, a senior White House official tells CNN. The White House is aware that Kushner's answer to Time in an interview published yesterday could have been more clear, which is why he issued a second statement. But this official said that the issue of changing the election date is simply not something being discussed because the Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power to establish election day. President Trump has also publicly said that he is in favor of keeping election day the same.  What this is all about:  Asked in a\u00a0video interview Tuesday for TIME 100 Talks\u00a0whether there was any scenario in which the election could be postponed \u2014 including a potential coronavirus outbreak in the fall \u2014 Kushner said, \"That's too far in the future to tell.\" Later, Kushner released a statement attempting to walk back the comments: \"I have not been involved in, nor am I aware of any discussions about trying to change the date of the presidential election,\" he said. Remember: Even if Republicans in Congress were to favor a change, a Democrat-led House would need to agree as well.\u00a0 And in more than 13 states across across the country, the Republican National Committee and other Republican state officials are currently arguing that it is possible for Americans to vote safely in person right now and in November, despite the coronavirus. A push to change election day would also mean upending these legal arguments. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u00a0was released from prison today following a request by his lawyers due to the coronavirus pandemic, his attorney Kevin Downing said. Downing told CNN that Manafort is going to serve the rest of his term in home confinement after serving about a third of his sentence at a federal prison in Western Pennsylvania. Manafort has been in jail since June 2018.\u00a0He is serving a 7.5-year sentence for bank and tax fraud and foreign lobbying-related crimes. Fear of coronavirus proliferating behind bars has consumed inmates across the country, and the Bureau of Prisons has moved almost 2,500 inmates with coronavirus risk to home confinement as of this week in an effort to stop the spread of the disease within its facilities.  The prison where Manafort was living currently has no confirmed cases. Read more here. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is expanding the open streets initiative in the city to assist with social distancing, adding 12 more miles tomorrow for pedestrians to the already 9 miles allocated in the city. Starting tomorrow, the city will open throughout the boroughs... 1.3 miles with local partners (business improvement districts)\n7.6 miles with local police precincts\n2.8 miles adjacent to parks There will also be 9.2 miles of protected bike lanes opening throughout May, he said. ##New York## There are now 82 confirmed cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday. It has \u201cgone up consistently in recent days\u201d he said.\u00a0 De Blasio added 53 of the cases have either tested positive for Covid-19 or had Covid-19 antibodies. There has been 1 death reported. He said there are many unknowns still including \u201cwhat makes kids susceptible,\u201d and how long the illness takes to manifest in children. ##New York## Texas inmates have begun self-administering oral-fluid tests for Covid-19, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\u00a0\u00a0 The department announced Tuesday that it launched 12 strike teams to prisons across the state.\u00a0Nearly 1,500 tests were collected in the first few hours of testing, according to officials \u201cThese tests are readily available and deployable,\u201d said Bryan Collier, the department's executive director. \u201cIncreasing the information available to our medical professionals will help us to further enhance the agency\u2019s ability of stop the spread of Covid-19.\u201d\u00a0 The TDCJ says they expect the positive case rate to \"increase dramatically\" as a result of this expanded testing.\u00a0\u00a0 By the numbers: There are at least 652 Texas Justice employees and 1,733 offenders who have tested positive for Covid-19. Thirty prisoners and seven staff members have died of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio thanked the House for the stimulus framework they put forward and called the plan the \u201cgame changer\u201d the city needed. He said there is no such thing as a \u201ccity who can stand up against a pandemic alone.\u201d The House plan allocates $17 billion for NYC over two years, as well as $34 billion for New York state.  What we have needed is a clear commitment from the federal government for a massive stimulus plan,\u201d he added.  \u201cFinally we see the beginning of such a plan,\u201d he said adding, \u201cfinally we see a step forward in Washington.\u201d De Blasio said Congress and the President have needed to \u201cact at a level that actually fits this absolutely unprecedented moment in American history,\u201d adding that the House plan, \u201cactually lives up to the moment.\u201d ##Economy## In February, the US unemployment rate was near a 50-year low of 3.5%. In April, it\u00a0skyrocketed to 14.7%, the highest level ever recorded since 1948 when the government began tracking the monthly data. The road back to a healthier labor market will be painful, said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during a virtual event at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It will be particularly painful because recently hired and lower-paid workers are the ones bearing the brunt of the pain, Powell said. The unemployment rate will probably peak \"over the course of the next month or so,\" he added, and it's reasonable to expect a decline in the unemployment rate after. This decline might even be sharp, but US unemployment will likely remain well above the lows seen at the start of the year. ##Economy## The California State University system canceled most in-person classes through the fall semester.  This decision was based on concerns around class sizes due to social distancing guidelines and the ability to perform tests and contact tracing, according to Eduardo M. Ochoa, President of California State University, Monterey Bay. \u201cIn the calculations that we made\u00a0in our campus, we found that in\u00a0order to maintain social\u00a0distancing guidelines, we would\u00a0have to reduce the capacity of\u00a0our classrooms to 25% of their\u00a0normal levels.\u00a0So we would have to drastically\u00a0reduce the number of students\u00a0enrolled at least in face to\u00a0face instruction.\u00a0And it just didn\u2019t\u00a0seem viable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were also very concerned\u00a0about our ability to do testing and tracing of contacts,\u201d he added. \u201cFrankly, the prospect of bringing\u00a0students from across the state\u00a0and across the country to\u00a0converge on little Monterey\u00a0County, we face the prospect of\u00a0turning the campus into a\u00a0cluster that would actually\u00a0single-handedly drive infection\u00a0rates in our county.\u00a0We didn\u2019t really want to do\u00a0that.\u201d The health experts expect coronavirus to rebound in the fall and winter, \u201cso we want to be\u00a0able to provide our students and\u00a0their families with sufficient\u00a0planning time,\u201d according to Soraya Coley, President of Cal Poly Pomona. \u201cWe also want\u00a0to use this as an opportunity to\u00a0review what we\u2019ve done in the\u00a0last several months, and to use\u00a0this summer to be very\u00a0intentional about providing the\u00a0kind of quality education that\u00a0the state system is known for,\" Coley said.  Virtual education, she says, \u201cis different. It does not mean that it is less\u00a0quality.\u201d ##California## Stocks fell at the open as investors digested comments from Federal Reserce Chair Jerome Powell, who said significant risks remain in the economy and recovery isn't here yet.  Here's how the markets opened: The\u00a0Dow\u00a0fell 100 points at the open\nThe\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0fell 0.3%\nThe\u00a0Nasdaq\u00a0was flat \u00a0##Economy## The price of food staples, such as eggs, meats and cereal,\u00a0climbed in April\u00a0as more Americans stocked up on food during the coronavirus pandemic. Food prices for groceries recorded its biggest increase since February 1974, rising 2.6%, according to the Labor Department\u00a0on Tuesday. The\u00a0price index for eggs climbed more than 16%\u00a0\u2014 the biggest increase for any food item. The increase was broad-based, with all six major grocery store food groups increasing at least 1.5% over the month, according to the the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0. Meanwhile, prices of other industries are tumbling:\u00a0The grocery numbers\u00a0stand in contrast\u00a0to the broader trend in US prices, where prices fell by 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in April, marking the largest drop since December 2008. That's an alarming drop, dragged down primarily by\u00a0falling gasoline\u00a0and\u00a0energy prices. But excluding volatile food and energy, prices still fell by 0.4%. That's the largest monthly decline in the so-called core consumer price index since the BLS began tracking the data in 1957. Some context:\u00a0Economists expected the coronavirus crisis to have a largely deflationary effect. The April data is proof of that. That's bad news for policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who like to keep inflation at around 2% \u2014 widely accepted as the ideal balance for the US economy. \"Even as the economy reopens, core inflation is likely headed below 1% in the coming year in the face of high unemployment and low commodity prices,\" said Sal Guatieri, Senior Economist at BMO. ##Economy## The coronavirus crisis has devastated the US economy over the past weeks \u2014 and the \"scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent,\" according to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. It's \"significantly worse than any recession since World War II,\" the Fed chief said in\u00a0prepared remarks\u00a0at a\u00a0virtual event\u00a0hosted by the Peterson Institute of International Economics. \"People have put their lives and livelihoods on hold, making enormous sacrifices to protect not just their own health and that of their loved ones, but also their neighbors and the broader community. While we are all affected, the burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it,\" he said, according to the remarks. Powell noted the country has already erased almost all the job gains of the last decade, and the labor woes are hurting low-income families in particular. Almost 40% of households earning less than $40,000 a year as of February lost their jobs in March, he added, citing a forthcoming Fed survey. ##Economy## New\u00a0Orleans\u00a0Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced that the city would reopen in a \"very slow\" manner starting Saturday. \"Based on the guidance of our\u00a0health care\u00a0professionals, we are where we need to be to slowly reopen the city,\" she said yesterday. \"If we do not do well in this first phase, we will not be going to any other phase.\"\u00a0 Phase 1 will start at 6 a.m. on Saturday. At that time... Restaurants can open, but they need reservations to have a log for contact tracing. \nGyms can open under 25% occupancy without group activities. Personal training is approved in this initial phase, according to Cantrell.\u00a0\nChurches will be allowed to open at 25% capacity or at 100 people, whichever is smaller.\u00a0 During this phase, the city is mandating residents to wear face coverings in public.\u00a0Close contact businesses \u2014 such as spas, massage parlors and tattoo shops \u2014 will not be allowed to reopen in phase one, according to Cantrell.\u00a0 ##Reopening## You could be singing, cheering on your favorite sports team at a match or just talking loudly. But in any of these cases, the coronavirus can spread fairly rapidly, according to Erin Bromage, a biology professor at UMass Dartmouth. He cautioned against being in noisy and crowded indoor spaces \u2014 especially if there is poor air circulation. When singing, he said \u201cyou are pushing a lot of\u00a0air out.\u00a0And it expels a lot more\u00a0respiratory droplets into the\u00a0air.\u201d \u201cBeing in an enclosed\u00a0space and singing like that for a\u00a0number of hours, just allows it to\u00a0build up in the environment\u00a0around you,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re taking big\u00a0deep breaths in order to sing\u00a0your next note or next piece and\u00a0that, you know, facilitates the\u00a0virus getting into you and even\u00a0deeper down into your throat and\u00a0into your lungs.\u00a0Which just helps with\u00a0establishing the infection.\u201d When it comes to talking, \u201cnormal\u00a0talking\u00a0releases a\u00a0certain amount of respiratory\u00a0droplets.\u00a0And the louder you\u00a0talk, the\u00a0more you release,\" he said. So in an environment where people are talking loudly, it just means\u00a0there will be more respiratory droplets in the\u00a0air if there are infected people\u00a0around, he said. Bromage also said that sports arenas need to be thought through. \u201cIt is not like a single person\u00a0in an arena can infect\u00a0everybody.\u00a0But if you\u2019re yelling and screaming\u00a0and supporting your team, those\u00a0people in the spray zone of your\u00a0voice, you know, you\u2019re putting\u00a0them in danger,\" he said. Watch: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the new Democratic proposal for $3 trillion in coronavirus relief, saying the sweeping plan embodies \u201cwhat we think this country needs.\u201d \"This is all about the here and now. It isn\u2019t about politics, it\u2019s about humanity,\u201d she said during an interview on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe'.  About the package: The plan largely reflects Democratic priorities, and as it was not the product of bipartisan negotiations with the Senate, it is not expected to advance past the House. It is expected to cost more than $3 trillion, dwarfing the stimulus measure enacted in March, which was more than $2 trillion and at the time amounted to the largest emergency aid package in American history. \u201cI don\u2019t call it a wishlist,\u201d Pelosi said today. \"I call it an American wishlist.\" \u201cIt\u2019s a big ticket. It\u2019s a lot of money. The American people are worth it,\u201d she added. ##Economy## At least 82,387 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the US: There are also at least\u00a01,369,964\u00a0cases\u00a0of the disease in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University's latest tally.\nKey model predicts increased US death toll: The model suggests that 147,000 coronavirus deaths will occur in the US by August 4.That\u2019s an increase of about 10,000 deaths compared to the model\u2019s estimate from this weekend, which was already higher than earlier projections.\nMike Pompeo arrives in Israel: The US Secretary of State posted pictures of himself wearing a red, white and blue face mask after touching down at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv on Wednesday.\nJoe Biden's advisers want people entering his home tested for Covid-19: The Democratic frontrunner's public health advisory council has suggested that Biden and those entering his home should be tested for the disease. Biden discussed the advice in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine. ##Catch Up## Joe\u00a0Biden\u00a0has said his public health advisory council believes he should be tested for coronavirus, along with anyone coming into his home. In a Vanity Fair interview with Peter Hamby, host of Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America,\u201d the former vice president said he was yet to be tested for the disease, while discussing the pandemic. \u201cThey told me, everyone in the Secret Service and this shift has been tested. Everybody comes into my home. The people who are helping me today. They wear gloves, rubber gloves, and a mask,\u201d\u00a0Biden said, of the health protocols in place around his home.\n\u201cEvery morning I have an hour brief from the public health people. And what they\u2019re telling me is they think that I should move [in] the direction [of] the White House, that anyone coming in should be tested. And I should be tested. I haven\u2019t been tested. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s in play. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d At least\u00a082,387\u00a0people have died in the US from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University's latest tally of cases. There are at least\u00a01,369,964\u00a0cases\u00a0of the disease in the country. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases. CNN is tracking cases of Covid-19 in the US here. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted pictures of himself wearing a red, white and blue face mask after touching down at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. Glad to be in Israel to coordinate with (Israeli leaders) on countering two critical threats: Covid-19 and Iran,\" Pompeo tweeted. A memo went out to White House staffers on Monday saying it is now required for all staffers entering the West Wing to wear a face covering, a source familiar told CNN. Several Trump administration staff have tested positive for coronavirus in recent days. Prices are tumbling\u00a0in America as the coronavirus lockdown drags on and people spend less. US consumer prices declined for the second-straight month in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday. Prices fell by 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in April, marking the largest drop since December 2008. That's an alarming drop, dragged down primarily by\u00a0falling gasoline\u00a0and\u00a0energy prices. But excluding volatile food and energy, prices still fell by 0.4%. That's the largest monthly decline in the so-called core consumer price index since the BLS began tracking the data in 1957. Falling prices might sound like a good thing, but economists agree that deflation -- the opposite of inflation -- would be very bad news. When prices fall because people aren't buying things, manufacturers sometimes can't charge enough to make the product they're trying to sell. That means they'll stop making those products and lay off workers. That can start a vicious circle in which demand continues to fall as more people lose their jobs. Read more here. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, warned senators Tuesday that states and cities face serious consequences if they open up too quickly, urging states not to reopen until they know they have the capabilities to handle an inevitable uptick in cases once they relax stay-at-home orders. In a high-profile hearing where witnesses and many lawmakers joined via video conference, Fauci also told a Senate committee on Tuesday it was a \"bridge too far\" for schools to expect a vaccine or widely available treatment for Covid-19 by the time students return to campuses in the fall, though he expressed optimism a vaccine would be developed in the next year or two. Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was subdued but candid in his testimony about efforts to respond to the coronavirus outbreak and roll-back stay-at-home orders on Tuesday in the Senate's first hearing on the coronavirus outbreak since March. He told the Senate panel he did not have a \"confrontational relationship\" with President Donald Trump, but Fauci's testimony nevertheless contrasted with Trump's increasingly vocal push in recent days for states to re-open businesses. \"My concern that if some areas -- cities, states or what have you -- jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up, without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks,\" Fauci said in testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

Restrictions on businesses and public places will continue to be lifted, while the order remains, Ferrer explained. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told CNN that Ferrer wasn't saying Los Angeles will stay as-is into August. \"I think quite simply she's saying we're not going to fully reopen Los Angeles \u2014 or anywhere in America \u2014 without any protections or health orders in the next three months,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. Some schools will cancel in-person classes: The California State University system plans to cancel nearly all in-person classes through the fall semester to reduce spread of coronavirus. The CSU system, which comprises 23 universities across the state, will be moving most instruction online, Chancellor Timothy White announced Tuesday at a Board of Trustees meeting. The California State University system is the nation\u2019s largest four-year public university system with a total enrollment of more than 480,000 students, according to the CSU. ##California## A key coronavirus model often cited by the White House has again raised its coronavirus death projection, now predicting 147,000 deaths in the US by August 4. That\u2019s an increase of about 10,000 deaths compared to the model\u2019s estimate from this weekend, which was already higher than earlier projections. On Sunday, Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, tied the earlier increase to \u201cexplosive increases in mobility in a number of states.\u201d Compared to Sunday, the model now projects about 2,450 additional deaths in New York, 2,000 additional deaths in Massachusetts and 1,700 additional deaths in Pennsylvania. Other states saw sizable increases as well. North Carolina, for example, is now expected to see about 3,200 more deaths, and Maryland about 1,200 more. Some states saw decreases in projected deaths, however, including Georgia, which is now expected to see 1,500 fewer deaths. The model\u2019s projection for Indiana has also gone down by 1,600 deaths. On its website, IHME said exact reasons for the changes vary by state. But the institute pointed to \u201cepidemiological indicators and key drivers of viral transmission,\u201d like changes in testing and mobility. IHME also pointed to the easing of social distancing policies, but said \u201cthe full potential effects of recent actions to ease social distancing policies, especially if robust containment measures have yet to be fully scaled up, may not be fully known for a few weeks due to the time periods between viral exposure, possible infection, and full disease progression.\u201d \u00a0"], "Language": false}
