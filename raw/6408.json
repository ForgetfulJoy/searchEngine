You're going to have to check it out.\" However, there is no \"definitive information to be able to make any comment,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the briefing. The relationship between lupus and Covid-19 is currently being studied in \"a natural history study,\" Fauci said. Trump later stated he would take the medication, likely as a preventative measure, given his negative Covid-19 testing. \"But I think people should [take hydroxychloroquine],\" he said. \"If\u00a0it were me, in fact, I might do\u00a0it anyway.

The donations came in two separate shipments: The first arrived at Newark International Airport on April 2 and has already been distributed. The second shipment, which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo referenced at his most recent press conference, arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday. The Tsais have considerable ties to the New York City-metropolitan community. Joe Tsai owns the Brooklyn Nets basketball team and Barclays Center Arena in Brooklyn. \u201cWe kept hearing cries for PPE from our community and wanted to help,\u201d said Clara, who said New York state authorities will allocate the second shipment, but \u201cit\u2019s our intention to help the most under-served institutions.\u201d Clara cited Jacobi Medical Center and Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx and Elmhurst Hospital in Queens as the institutions she and her husband thought might need the supplies the most.  The 2,000 ventilators that were donated are noninvasive, so they are not the type that can be used on patients who are unconscious.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Health## President Trump said his use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) was in part \u201cretaliation\u201d on companies that have not given the government what they have asked for. \u201cYou\u00a0could call it retaliations\u00a0because that's what it is.\u00a0It's a retaliation.\u00a0If people don't \u2014 if people\u00a0don't give us what we need for\u00a0our people, we're going to be\u00a0very tough, and we've been very\u00a0tough,\u201d Trump said during a briefing today. Some context: Last night, Trump invoked the DPA to \u201cto ensure that certain health and medical resources are allocated for domestic use\u201d according to a statement released by the White House announcing the action. Trump specifically mentioned 3M and said he wants that company to provide masks to America instead of sending masks to other places.\u00a0 \u201cFEMA and HHS have ordered\u00a0180 million \u2014 think of that \u2014\u00a0180 million.\u00a0Who ever heard of 180 million\u00a0N95 masks, and we're working now\u00a0with 3M to see whether or not\u00a0that all works out, but we want\u00a0them to help our country, and I\u00a0think it's going to be okay.\u00a0We're going to soon let you\u00a0know, but we need the masks.\u00a0We don't want other people\u00a0getting it,\u00a0\u201d Trump said. Watch more:  President Trump announced moments ago that some ventilators will be sent to New York from a stockpile of 10,000 the government has amassed.  \"We have now 10,000 in our\u00a0pipeline and stock piled.\u00a010,000, close.\u00a0And we're moving some into New\u00a0York.\u00a0We're going to need some\u00a0additional.\u00a0We're moving some into New York\u00a0City and state, separately.\u00a0And we're bringing them to the\u00a0point where they'll need them.\u00a0I can also report that at my\u00a0direction 1,000 military\u00a0personnel are deploying to New\u00a0York City to assist where they\u00a0are needed the most. That is the hottest of all the\u00a0hot spots,\" Trump said. Trump added: \"New Jersey is right there right\u00a0next to it and I don't know if\u00a0that is overflow but New Jersey\u00a0is a great state and a crowded\u00a0state also.\" There are 113,806 coronavirus cases in New York and 3,565 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. ##Health## President Trump said that this week and next will probably be the toughest in the fight against coronavirus and that \u201cthere will be a lot of death.\u201d While speaking at the coronavirus task force briefing on Saturday, Trump painted a grim picture of the next two weeks, but added that there will be less death than if certain mitigation steps were not taken. \u201cThis will be\u00a0probably the toughest week\u00a0between this week and next week,\u00a0and there will be a lot of\u00a0death, unfortunately, but a lot\u00a0less death than if this wasn't\u00a0done but there will be death,\u201d Trump said.

Arkansas Gov. Asa\u00a0Hutchinson\u00a0has directed vacation rental properties, motels and hotels not to issue occupancy to \"out of state recreational travelers\" in an executive order issued Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0 It's been a challenge as \"people leave New Orleans or they go from another hot spot, they see the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to come to Arkansas,\"\u00a0Hutchinson\u00a0said at a press briefing.\u00a0 Occupancy should only be issued to health care workers,\u00a0first responders, airline crew, journalists, Covid-19 patients or work related travelers,\u00a0Hutchinson\u00a0says. Hutchinson\u00a0has\u00a0not issued a stay-at-home order \"primarily because most people are making responsible choices,\"\u00a0Hutchinson\u00a0said in a statement Friday. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## ##Business## California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that 126,700 individuals have been tested for coronavirus statewide, according to a press conference he held on Saturday \u201cThat testing number may sound high to some. It is low to many others and certainly to me,\u201d Newsom said. Out of the 126,700 tests that have been administered, the state is still waiting on results for 13,000 individuals.  \"We have substantially reduced that backlog, a lot of that had to do with the commercial labs stepping up,\u201d Newsom said.\u00a0 The governor admittedly \"owned up\" to the largest county in the state not providing data collection in real time to Californians saying, \u201cyou deserve better and more and we are going to do just that.\u201d What else is being done: In the last week or so, Newsom\u2019s office created a newly formed task force led by private and public sector leaders tasked with handling coronavirus testing headed by co-chairs Paul Markovich, president and CEO of Blue Shield of California, and Dr. Charity Dean, an Assistant Director at California Dept. of Public Health. ##Health## \u00a0 JPMorgan Chase is still having issues processing the thousands of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) applications it received through the online portal that went live Friday, according to an executive familiar with the process. The problem isn\u2019t tied to JPM\u2019s system\u2014it stems from the lack of clear guidance from the government about the program\u2019s requirements and the lack of a streamlined way to transfer information from the bank\u2019s customers to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on day one, said the person.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe biggest struggle so far has been in locking down the SBA on what information we need to send them in order to get a loan number,\u201d said the person.\u00a0\u201cAnd that loan number is the most important thing because that\u2019s what allows us to then fund the customer.\u201d It\u2019s becoming clear that the government didn\u2019t plan this out well and that the volume is greater than it expected, the person said. Officials at the Treasury Department and SBA pushed back on the criticism, citing the fact that smaller lenders have been able to process the application. \u201cBillions of dollars in loans have been registered on the very first day of activity.\u00a0We are continuing to update guidance and work with lenders to ensure that all eligible borrowers and lenders are able to participate in this critical program to provide much-needed relief to hardworking Americans and businesses,\u201d said a Treasury spokesman. But it appears the administration rolled out the program before providing the larger lenders the tools they need to process large volumes, said the person familiar with JP Morgan Chase\u2019s progress in processing the PPP applications. A bottleneck: Right now, on the front end, the bank\u2019s online portals are taking thousands of applications, but the applications are getting stuck because the back-end requires bank representatives to call each applicant for more information. That\u2019s because the front-end online application has been streamlined to the most basic questions, which don\u2019t give the bank enough information to complete the SBA form. As a result, a bank rep has to call each applicant.\u00a0 \u201cThe volume is going to be small in the beginning,\u201d said the person. There are now 300,915\u00a0cases of coronavirus and\u00a08,162\u00a0deaths in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. On Saturday,\u00a0at least\u00a022,962\u00a0new cases\u00a0and at least\u00a01,010\u00a0new deaths were reported in the US,\u00a0according to Johns Hopkins. ##Health## Dr. Wayne Riley, the president of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York, said medical staff will have to start using rain ponchos and garbage bags instead of surgical gowns. Riley told CNN the medical center only has enough gowns to last about one and half days. \"We cannot wait for the national\u00a0stockpile to supply us. As we all\u00a0know, the national stockpile is\u00a0pretty diminished.\u00a0So we're going to get creative,\" he said Saturday. ##Health## A panel of experts have been answering your questions about life in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the most common questions: Q: Should I worry about contracting the virus from mail and newspapers? A:\u00a0Dr. Darria Long, emergency room physician: \"There is not evidence you\u00a0may contract the coronavirus\u00a0from mail and newspapers but\u00a0that said if you want to be on\u00a0the safer side we know that\u00a0Covid can live on cardboard for\u00a0about 24 hours.\u00a0If you want to take the extra\u00a0precaution you can effectively\u00a0quarantine that mail, say in\u00a0your garage or someplace, for about\u00a024 hours then open it up and\u00a0wash your hands well after you\u00a0do it.\" Q: There's a lot of talk about social distancing but what do you do when you are on an overcrowded subway or bus? A:\u00a0Dr. Darria Long, emergency room physician:\u00a0\"For one, of course, maintain\u00a0social distancing as much as you\u00a0can.\u00a0If you can stay six feet away\u00a0from other people on the bus or\u00a0subway, do so.\u00a0Other than that, I would absolutely want someone to be\u00a0wearing a mask the entire time they are on there,\u00a0even a cloth mask.\u00a0Then you can do two other\u00a0things.\u00a0You can wear an outer layer you\u00a0carefully remove when you get\u00a0out of the subway or bus or wear\u00a0gloves.\u00a0But key point, we are seeing a\u00a0lot of people wear gloves and I do have t say you have to remove them\u00a0carefully or you eliminate the\u00a0effect.\u00a0So you pinch the outer glove\u00a0with one hand and take your\u00a0clean finger to remove the other\u00a0so you're not touching the\u00a0outside.\u00a0Of course wash your hands\u00a0afterwards.\" Q: How do I talk to my 65-year-old father about limiting his visits to the store without sounding like I am scolding him? A:\u00a0Dr. Gail Saltz, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst: \"The relationships that\u00a0are happening between adult\u00a0children and their parents and\u00a0kids who suddenly arrive back\u00a0home, there is pressure going on\u00a0and anxiety going on that things\u00a0are being heard in critical ways\u00a0or people are saying things in\u00a0irritable ways which is all very\u00a0understandable. But if you\u00a0realize that your parent is used\u00a0to being\u00a0'the parent'\u00a0and you\u00a0simply say, hey, I love you and I'm really just\u00a0worried about you so I'm asking\u00a0you not to do this because I\u00a0understand it puts you at\u00a0greater risk and for me, my worry, my anxiety, I would\u00a0really feel better if you\u00a0wouldn't do it which is\u00a0different than saying, hey.\u00a0I know better and I told you so.\" Q: Mosquito season is about to start. Should we be concerned about mosquitos transmitting Covid-19? A:\u00a0Dr. Darria Long, emergency room physician: \"We know mosquitos can carry\u00a0other viruses, but there is not\u00a0evidence right now they can actually\u00a0transmit coronavirus from one\u00a0person to another.\" ##Health## A total of\u00a07,560\u00a0people in France have died after contracting coronavirus, France's Director-General of Health J\u00e9r\u00f4me\u00a0Salomon\u00a0said Friday.

There were 261 Covid-19 patients, 64 in critical care, 172 in non-critical care and 25 in the emergency department. Seven people died of Covid-19 in 36 hours, through early Saturday morning, the administrator told CNN. Thirty Covid-19 positive patients were admitted to the hospital throughout the day. In total, 81 percent of the hospital\u2019s population is Covid-19 positive. This one hospital alone has seen 53 people die of Covid-19 to date. By the end of the day Friday, 88 of its critical care beds were in use with only five left. The administrator said 64 of its ICU ventilators were in use, with 42 ICU level ventilators still left. \u201cRight now ventilators are not the issue. We got a huge influx,\u201d the administrator said, of his hospital. \u201cFor us, the issue is ICU beds and staff. We have staff that are getting sick.\u201d There are at least\u00a0290,606\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a07,826 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the country. On Saturday,\u00a0at least\u00a012,653\u00a0new cases and at least\u00a0674\u00a0new deaths in the US have been reported,\u00a0according to a tally by Johns Hopkins.\u00a0 The US Navy says a \u201cfew patients\u201d that were sent from the Javits Center to the USNS Comfort who tested positive for Covid-19.\u00a0 The patients were isolated upon arrival to the Comfort, which is docked in New York City, while they awaited test results and were transferred back to the Javits Center once the test results came in.\u00a0 \u201cWhile admitting patients who were transferred to USNS Comfort for treatment, a few patients tested positive for Covid-19. The patients were isolated immediately upon arrival and received care for the entirety of their time aboard the ship, and were transferred as soon as practical to the Javits Center, which is treating Covid-19 patients. Our medical experts on board are well prepared for cases like this, and have taken the appropriate precautionary measures The Comfort is capable of continuing its mission,\" Navy spokesperson Cdr. Ashley Hockycko said in a statement. Separately, a defense official told CNN that about five patients brought to the ship from Javits did test positive for coronavirus when they were tested at the ship, which is the procedure for all patients arriving at USNS Comfort.  While the test results were coming in, which took about an hour, the patients were kept in isolation. When the result came back positive, the patients were transferred back to Javits which has the ability to treat coronavirus patients.\u00a0 Some context: CNN reported Friday that\u00a0ambulances are not taking people directly to the ship, which docked in New York City on Monday.  Patients are referred to the ship by shore-based hospitals and must be screened and tested for the virus before being admitted on board. ##Health## Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is calling for the president to invoke the full Defense Production Act as states struggle with medical supply shortages. \"We are not going to overcome\u00a0this supply problem unless we\u00a0have someone, a military person\u00a0in charge,\" Schumer said today. Schumer said he talked to President Trump and other White House officials and asked them to seriously consider allowing the military to take over factories and supply chains. \"We're in a wartime here, and we\u00a0need this military leader,\u00a0command and control with the\u00a0president's full backing, and\u00a0that will make this horrible,\u00a0horrible scourge end more\u00a0quickly with fewer illnesses and\u00a0fewer deaths,\" Schumer said. Some context: President Trump\u00a0signed a presidential memorandum\u00a0on Thursday that directed six more companies to help make ventilators. But, after signing the executive order, Trump initially stopped short of using it against specific companies saying that businesses were voluntarily pitching in. The high number of coronavirus-related deaths across the United Kingdom is \"likely to continue\" over the course of the next two weeks,\u00a0the national medical director for England's National Health Service, Stephen Powis, said Saturday.\u00a0 \"Unfortunately, and with great sadness, the number of deaths continues to be high\u2026that is likely to continue over the next week or two until we get on top and stop this virus,\" Powis told reporters during a press briefing at Downing Street.\u00a0\"I do think, sadly, that we will continue to see those high numbers of deaths that we have seen at the moment.\" Powis urged members of the public to not be complacent, and to continue to follow the guidance and instructions issued by the government.\u00a0 \"Hospitalizations are still going up, so this is not the time to be complacent and to take our foot off the pedal. We need to continue to comply with those instructions, because that will translate, in the next week or two, into a reduction in hospital admissions,\" Powis urged.\u00a0 \"As we start to get control of this through social distancing, in a few weeks that will start to fall,\" he added. ##Health## Pennsylvania has 1,597 new cases of Covid-19 as of Saturday morning, the state's\u00a0Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said at a briefing.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0state now has 10,017 cases in 64 counties, Levine said.\u00a0 Approximately\u00a010% of patients require hospitalization, according to Levine.\u00a0There are have been 136 coronavirus-related deaths across the state, Levine said.\u00a0\u00a0 Levine said 189 of the state's cases are health care workers.\u00a0 ##Health## The United Kingdom has received 300 ventilators from China to aid efforts by the National Health Service to support and treat patients who have contracted coronavirus, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove said Saturday.\u00a0 \"We have been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad, including Germany and Switzerland, and today 300 new ventilators arrived from China,\" Gove told reporters during a briefing at Downing Street.\u00a0 In addition to increasing the capacity of the NHS to deploy invasive ventilators, Gove confirmed that the government is also working to secure non-invasive ventilators for National Health Service hospitals, including a new and clinically-approved device developed by University College London (UCL).\u00a0 \"We have secured new non-invasive capacity with the help of UK manufacturers, who have worked at pace to develop new technologies,\" Gove said.\u00a0\"A team from University College London, working with Mercedes Benz, have produced a new device which has been clinically approved.\" According\u00a0to Gove, UCL was able to produce 250 devices on Friday. Missouri Gov. Michael Parson is recruiting medical professionals to supplement the state\u2019s current health care workforce amid the coronavirus pandemic.  \u201cWe are calling on all available medical professionals to support the effort to fight the virus by joining a critical reserve unit now focusing on providing care in high need areas across the state. Their efforts can help save the lives of their fellow Missourians,\u201d Parson said in a statement on Saturday. Selected medical professionals would become part of the Missouri Disaster Medical Assistance Team which is slated to operate throughout the state of Missouri and deployed when necessary to provide patients with on-site medical care. Missouri has 2,155 confirmed coronavirus cases and 33 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo elaborated on the spread of coronavirus on Long Island today saying it is like a \"fire spreading.\" Cuomo said the number of cases on Long Island has grown steadily for the past 10 days, and is not moving more north but moving \u201cmore east.\u201d \u201cNew York City went from 75% percent of cases in the state down to 65 and that is almost all growth in long island from 15% of the cases to 22 so the shift is undeniable\u201d Cuomo said during a press conference. Melissa DeRosa, the secretary to the governor, said there have been 2,624 coronavirus deaths in New York City and 941 outside the city. ##Health## Gov Andrew Cuomo said New York has 85,000 medical volunteers, including 22,000 out of state volunteers, according to comments he made at a press conference today. Cuomo said he is signing an executive order to allow medical students slated to graduate to begin practicing. \u201cI want all of this to be over,\u201d Cuomo said Saturday regarding the pandemic. The governor mentioned his mother has been stressed about his brother and CNN anchor Chris Cuomo\u2019s positive diagnosis. Read a tweet from Cuomo about the order: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the number of ICU cases and intubations in the state has increased while New York continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, Cuomo said the number of patients being discharged also increased. \"Two-thirds of the people who\u00a0have been hospitalized have been\u00a0discharged,\" he said at a press briefing Saturday, \"That's what we've been saying\u00a0all along.\u00a0Most people won't be\u00a0hospitalized.\" There are 15,905 people in the hospital and 4,126 in ICU, Cuomo said. As of today, 3,565 people have died due to coronavirus in New York. ##Health## Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today that New York will receive 1,140 ventilators from China and Oregon. The Chinese government has facilitated a donation\u00a0of 1,000 ventilators that are expected to arrive at JFK Airport today, Cuomo said moments ago during a press conference. \"This is a big deal and\u00a0it's going to make a significant\u00a0difference for us.\u00a0Also, the state of Oregon\u00a0contacted us and is going to\u00a0send 140 ventilators,\" Cuomo added. \"Which is I can tell you just\u00a0astonishing and unexpected.\u00a0And I want to thank Gov.\u00a0Brown, I want to thank all of\u00a0the people in the state of\u00a0Oregon for their thoughtfulness.\" Watch: New York has a total 113,704 Covid-19 cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today during a press conference. The state recorded a new high of positive cases Friday with 10,841. There are 15,905 people in the hospital and 4,126 in ICU, Cuomo said. As of today, 3,565 people have died due to Covid-19. \"By the numbers we're not yet at\u00a0the apex.\u00a0We're getting closer,\" Cuomo said.\u00a0 New York City\u2019s numbers are dropping and Long island positive case numbers are growing, Cuomo said. New York City's Javits\u00a0Convention Center\u00a0will have 2,500 beds and will be staffed entirely by the federal government, Cuomo said. Watch: Sheryl Pardo was preoccupied with one fact as she boarded her flight; this would be the last time she saw her mother. A surprise awaited her as she learned she was the only passenger on the plane because of the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic. She met Jessica and Dion, two flight attendants who turned her trip into something to remember in a good way. The American Airlines flight attendants bumped her up to first class and addressed her personally over the loudspeaker. Pardo spent the flight telling them about her mom and the loving, get-things-done person she was. \"I think in moments like this the pain of losing your mom is exacerbated by being in this frightening time,\" Pardo told CNN. \"Other people's kindness is what's going to get us to through this.\" \"I want them to know how much it meant to me,\" the 59-year-old said. \"It was super positive, which I didn't expect from that trip.\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that the capital's public spaces will only remain open if the government's stay-at home order is adhered to.\u00a0 \"Our public spaces will only stay open if Londoners follow the rules,\" Khan tweeted Saturday.\u00a0\"If you were planning to meet people outside this weekend, don\u2019t. If someone asks you to meet, say no.\" Some context: The mayor's warning follows an earlier call by the British government for members of the public to stay at home over the weekend, amid concerns that the sunny weather could see an uptick in the number of people gathering outside.\u00a0 \u201cIf you go out this weekend, you might catch more than the sun,\" Downing Street said in a tweet Saturday.\u00a0 The UK National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) has also confirmed that patrols will be taking place over the weekend to encourage people to follow the rules. \u201cPlease continue to stay at home and only travel for essentials. We know the\u00a0weather\u00a0is going to be nice, but the sooner we can beat Covid-19, the sooner we can all go back to enjoying the great outdoors,\u201d the NPCC said. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, wants to create a registry to track who has recovered from the coronavirus. \"We\u00a0strongly suspect that once\u00a0somebody has been infected\u00a0they're now immune,\" Cassidy said. He said a registry would be set up similar to the one that is used to document vaccinations. Once a patient has recovered, their name would be added to the registry. They could then return to work and help treat people with coronavirus without worrying about getting sick. He said this information would also help protect the rest of the population who do not have the virus. \"If we say 95% of\u00a0people are immune, even if a\u00a0person is spewing virus it would\u00a0mean the 95% of people are immune,\" he said. Cassidy said there is some uncertainty around whether the presence of antibodies actually means a person won't get the virus again. \"I can see there's uncertainty here, but if we wait for absolute certainty our economy's going to be in the tank,\" he said. \"So there's going to be a tradeoff on the absolute certainty on the medical aspect and opening up education and society for society to continue to flourish.\" So far, 9,920 people have recovered from coronavirus in the US, according to\u00a0Johns Hopkins University. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced that the country\u2019s state of alarm, which demands strict limits on people\u2019s movements and continues the closure of schools and most businesses, will continue for a further two weeks, until April 26. \"We are facing the great crisis of our lives,\" Sanchez said in a nationwide address.  The state of alarm had already been extended until April 11.\u00a0The government will ask the Spanish parliament to approve the extension on Tuesday. Sanchez added: \"Weeks of strict restrictions await us. We ask families to stay at home. To young people, to continue to study, to maintain momentum. To the elderly, to protect yourselves.\u201d\u00a0 He said that he understood how difficult it is for the nation to continue isolating at home for a further two weeks. \u201cThese days test our serenity. They are frenetic days. They make us anxious for our friends and family. They are the most difficult days of our life,\u201d Sanchez added. Sanchez also said that the government was preparing a plan for the eventual resumption of economic and social activity, once the curve of the coronavirus pandemic flattened. \"Once the curve clearly descends, a new scenario will open, a second stage, the progressive return to a new social normality and to a reconstruction of our economy and the social impact it is having in the form of job losses,\" Sanchez said. \u201cIn reconstruction we will have to protect the most vulnerable. In this emergency, no one will be left behind. Our strength will come from the union between business, administration and the different regions.\"\u00a0 A US health expert is concerned that prisons and jails could cause the coronavirus to spread faster in those facilities and outside. Dr. Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said that because of the high, concentrated number of people in these facilities, community spread is likely. \"The prison population in and of\u00a0itself has a fairly sizable, vulnerable population within\u00a0that, have a lot of chronic\u00a0conditions, other types of infections,\" Mathema said. \"We should also\u00a0ensure that what happens\u00a0in a prison, or a jail for that\u00a0matter, does not pose an undue\u00a0risk to the community.\u00a0In this case, we know we have\u00a0ample examples from many\u00a0infectious diseases.\" Once a virus or disease spreads within a prison, family members or staff can then bring it outside into the community.  Mathema said another reason why this could be a dangerous scenario is because of the frequency inmates are coming in and out of jails. \"It's particularly\u00a0troublesome if we should see\u00a0outbreaks, sort of occurring\u00a0within jails, where sort of the\u00a0incarcerated populations may be\u00a0moving in and out,\" he said. According to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u00a0(BJS), nearly 2.2 million adults were held in America's prisons and jails at the end of 2016. The United Kingdom has recorded 708 new deaths from coronavirus, the largest one-day rise since the outbreak began. According to figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care, a total of 4,313 have now died in the UK.\u00a0The figures are current to 5 p.m. (12 p.m. ET) on April 3, but were released a day later. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus as at 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) April 4 is 41,903, which is an increase of 3,735 from the previous day\u2019s figures. Nurses from Atlanta are flying to New York City to help treat coronavirus patients. Letha Love, an Atlanta ICU nurse, said she was shocked by what she saw when she arrived. \"I wasn't expecting it to be the amount of people that it was and the severity of it,\" she told CNN this morning. \"To hear the whole hospital calling codes all night, it's emotionally draining.\" This comes after New York City sent an emergency alert to phones, asking all licensed health care workers to support the city's health facilities. Love said she was originally planning to stay 3 to 6 weeks, but might return to Atlanta earlier. \"I do whatever it takes to protect myself so that I can go\u00a0back to my kids healthy and\u00a0strong.\u00a0But this is a lot.\u00a0It's a lot.\u00a0And people need to take it\u00a0serious,\" she said. Love said most of the patients she has worked with in New York so far have been intubated, but she wants their family members to know that nurses and other health professionals are taking care of them. \"We wouldn't come here if we weren't going to take care of them,\" she said. \"We came there to take care of them\" New York currently has 103,169 coronavirus cases and 2,935 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Spanish government is set to extend the nationwide \"state of alarm\" introduced on March 14 for a second time, until April 26. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is due to hold a news conference later Saturday (9 a.m. ET). A spokeswoman for the government told CNN:\u00a0\u201cThe announcement will be made shortly but you can take it as true.\u201d The leader of the opposition Popular Party Pablo Casado Blanco tweeted that he had \u201creceived a call from Pedro S\u00e1nchez to inform me that he will request Congress to extend the State of Alarm. I have once again transmitted to you the support of the Popular Party for the containment measures against the coronavirus.\u201d The state of alarm involves tight restrictions on movement and allows only essential workers to perform their duties. Like many\u00a0Americans\u00a0around the country, Gwen Berry is weighing her financial options. She is thinking about filing for unemployment, or seeing if she can get a day job, like the one she once held at Dick's Sporting Goods, to help stem the financial tide left behind by the\u00a0coronavirus. But unlike Americans, Berry is weighing these options as an\u00a0Olympic athlete. \"When people think of Olympians, they think of people who have a lot of money, like professional basketball players, or professional baseball players, and it's definitely not the case,\" Berry told\u00a0CNN Sport. Here's some context: The\u00a0postponed Tokyo Olympics\u00a0will be held from July 23 to August 8 in 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has confirmed. Read the full story here.  The Netherlands has recorded another 164 coronavirus deaths bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,651 \u2014 904 higher than Friday's total \u2014 according to new figures from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.\u00a0 The health authority said there have now been 16,627 confirmed coronavirus cases since the outbreak began, although it added that the true number will be higher because not everyone is tested.\u00a0 Numbers reflect social distancing measures: The Institute says the numbers reflect the \u201cinitial effects\u201d of government-imposed social distancing policies. \u201cThe number of patients admitted to hospital, and the number of deceased patients reported in the Netherlands is increasing less rapidly than would have been expected without measures in place,\u201d the Institute said. \u201cIt will take a considerable time to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. Everyone must continue to comply with the measures in the coming period,\" the Institute added. Passengers from all nationalities have been permitted to transit though Bahrain International Airport starting on April 3, Bahrain News Agency reported Saturday, quoting civil aviation authorities.\u00a0 Entry would remain restricted to Bahraini citizens, residents of the Kingdom, and travelers holding a letter of prior permission to enter, according to the agency.\u00a0 According to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States, there are at least\u00a0278,458\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the U.S. At least 7,159\u00a0people have died in the U.S. from coronavirus.\u00a0 The total includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories, as well as all repatriated cases. Meanwhile, Wyoming is the only state not reporting a death from coronavirus. Mixed messages on masks: President Donald Trump\u00a0said Friday his administration was now recommending Americans wear \"non-medical cloth\" face coverings, a reversal of previous guidance that suggested masks were unnecessary for people who weren't sick. But Trump said the recommendations, which came after a week of heated deliberations inside the White House, were voluntary and that he would not partake. \"I don't think I'm going to be doing it,\" he said, going on to suggest it was hard to envision such a thing in the Oval Office: \"Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens \u2014 I just don't see it.\" UK lockdown will remain for weeks: The UK\u2019s social distancing rules will remain in force for several more weeks, despite signs the coronavirus outbreak is slowing, one of the country\u2019s leading epidemiologists has said. India sees biggest day jump in cases: India has reported its biggest single-day jump in new coronavirus cases, with 601 in the past day representing a 26% rise, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\u00a0The country now has 3,082\u00a0cases and 86 deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Spain's death toll rise is flattening out: A further 809 people have now died from coronavirus in Spain, bringing the total to 11,744 deaths, according to Spanish Health Ministry figures released Saturday. The deaths are a rise of 7.3% -- but are the lowest increase since March 26.

The deaths are a rise of 7.3% but are the lowest increase since March 26. On Thursday, Spain's death toll surpassed 10,000, and the country joined Italy as one of only two countries to report five figure death tolls.  The ministry\u2019s most recent data shows there are now 78,733 active cases of Covid-19 in Spain, an increase of 2,511 from Thursday \u2013 but also the smallest daily rise since March 20. A total of 6,532 people have been admitted to intensive care units since the pandemic began. 12% increase in recoveries: The Spanish Health Ministry also reports that 34,219 have now recovered from the virus \u2013 nearly 4,000 more than the number reported Friday, and a 12% increase. While the number of active cases continues to rise, the rate of increase continues to slow. The latest numbers show the number of active cases recorded has risen 3% since Friday.

The death toll increased by 141 deaths in 24 hours.  There are now 85,778 coronavirus cases in Germany, with the total number of confirmed cases jumping 7% from Friday to Saturday.  Chancellor Angela\u00a0Merkel said Friday that there is a \u201cbit of hope\u201d for Germany after figures show that the spread of coronavirus is \u201ca bit slower than it was just a few days ago.\u201d Speaking on video published on the German federal government's YouTube channel, the Chancellor did stress however, that it was \u201cway too early to recognize a definite trend\u201d and \u201cit is far too early to loosen the strict rules.\u201d Merkel, herself now out of isolation, said it would be \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d to fix a date for the restrictions to be lifted and warned that Germany would \u201cgo from the frying pan into the fire \u2013 medically, economically and socially.\u201d Merkel\u00a0also urged all Germans to avoid traveling around the country during the upcoming Easter period. ##Health## The UK\u2019s social distancing rules will remain in force for several more weeks, despite signs the coronavirus outbreak is slowing, one of the country\u2019s leading epidemiologists has said.  Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the experts who has been advising the government on its response, told the BBC there\u2019s been an 85% drop in the typical number of people movements outside homes since the rules were put in place. He says that\u2019s vital to limiting the spread of the virus. Not \"normal life\": \u201cThe critical thing first is to get case numbers down, and then I'm hopeful... in a few weeks\u2019 time we will be able to move to a regime which will not be normal life -- let me emphasize that -- but will be somewhat more relaxed in terms of social distancing and the economy, but relying more on testing,\u201d he said. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the government will continue to keep the social distancing restrictions under review, and relax them \u201cif and when the evidence shows we are able to.\u201d Johnson said he has written to the leaders of opposition parties to \u201cinvite them to work together at this moment of national emergency.\u201d In his letter, Johnson described the coronavirus outbreak as the \u201cbiggest threat this country has faced in decades\u201d and one that will take months \u2013 not weeks \u2013 to fight. \u201cAs party leaders, we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency. Therefore, I would like to invite all leaders of opposition parties in Parliament to a briefing with myself, the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser next week,\u201d Johnson wrote. Renewed calls to stay at home amid sunny forecast: The government is again urging people to stay home during the weekend, despite the temptation to leave because of the nice weather. Downing Street posted a warning on Twitter, which said: \u201cIf you go out this weekend, you might catch more than the sun.\u201d The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) says patrols will be happening this weekend to encourage people to follow the rules. Six hundred members of the French military have coronavirus, French Defense Minister Florence Parly announced Saturday. \u201cThe situation is evolving, and we are following it very closely,\u201d the minister said, adding: \u201cOur operational capacity is not impacted.\u201d On Thursday, the ministry announced that four French soldiers from the Barkhane anti-jihadist operation in the Sahel -- a semi-arid region of western and north-central Africa that extends from Senegal to Sudan -- had tested positive. \u00a0 As the entire world grapples with the effects of the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak, it is easy to lose sight of how we got here. There are not many news events in recent memory that have come close to the far-reaching implications in terms of our public health, social interactions, and the global economy; life as we know it has been altered. From the beginning, CNN journalists have covered this unprecedented story from all corners of the globe. Three months since we heard the first whispers of a strange respiratory illness emerging in China, this is the story of a story -- from those who have witnessed and reported on it firsthand. Hear from our reporters in China, Hong Kong, Italy, and around the world about covering this global pandemic: Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, has laid bare the difficulties of responding to the coronavirus pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, writing on Twitter \"we are walking a tightrope.\" \"We have locked down educational institutions, Malls, marriage halls, restaurants & other places where public congregates. But, to stop the devastation of the lockdown we have kept our agri sector open & now we are opening up our construction sector,\" Khan wrote in a follow-up tweet.  There have been more than 2,700 cases of coronavirus in Pakistan, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.

The surge in cases has been linked to a religious gathering held at a New Delhi mosque in March, a senior health ministry official said. People from across India and overseas had gathered for the event. So far, 647 cases have been directly linked to the gathering, said Lav Agarwal, a senior official of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. He added that the cases have been identified and isolated across 14 states and union territories The Delhi government said earlier this week that it will be taking strict action against those responsible for organizing the gathering. \u201cWe are being told that a lot of people left this mosque and went to different parts of the country,\" Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said. \"It is scary to think how many people might have been impacted by this incident.\" ##Health## It's a topic of speculation every time a disaster hits. Will we see a baby boom nine months later, since so many couples are cooped up inside with nowhere to go?\u00a0 Demographers think it's unlikely. In fact, they say the US will probably see the number of births decrease -- and other notable population shifts are likely as well. \"There's no way that the number of births is going to go up,\" says Kenneth Johnson, a professor of sociology and demographer at the University of New Hampshire.  This is not the kind of environment in which people say, 'Let's bring a child into the world now.'\" Why we won't see a baby boom: Financial uncertainty often makes people postpone or even forgo decisions to have children. The pandemic is now adding to this financial anxiety, which can see long-term lasting impacts.\nMore people are dying in the US: The population is getting older and mortality rates are rising with the elderly while birth rates are decreasing. If the number of deaths starts to outpace the number of births, societal strain can follow.\nImmigration has dropped. Immigration rates had already been on the decline, but now the pandemic has shut borders. Immigration has historically kept populations' natural growth rate stable, with racial minorities making up more than half of US births. Read the full story here. What happens when a once-rejected dystopian novel turns into reality? Ask Scottish author Peter May. The screenwriter-turned-novelist wrote a book titled \"Lockdown\" in 2005 about a global pandemic. Fifteen years later, that's our reality due to coronavirus, which has so far infected more than\u00a01 million people\u00a0globally. The book, which was rejected by publishers at the time for being too unrealistic, was finally published on Thursday. The story, and the revival: The thriller is set in London, the epicenter of a global pandemic that forces officials to institute a lockdown.  Years ago, publishers dismissed the novel as \"extremely unrealistic and unreasonable,\" May said. So he put the book on the back burner and eventually forgot he even wrote it. That was until a fan on Twitter asked him to write a book set against the backdrop of the coronavirus. \"I thought about it for a minute before I realized that I've kind of already done it,\" May said. \"I told my publisher about it and my editor just about fell out of his chair. He read the entire book overnight and the next morning he said, 'This is brilliant. We need to publish this now.'\" \"Lockdown,\" available only on Amazon UK, is being sold in Kindle format and will be available as a paperback and audiobook on April 30. ##Daily Life## The rate of daily new coronavirus cases has slowed in Thailand, according to the country's Ministry of Public Health.

In a statement on Twitter, the company said it was halting the production and marketing of its beer because the Mexican government has shuttered non-essential businesses. The Anheuser-Busch Inbev-owned company also makes Modelo and Pacifico beers. This week, the Mexican government announced the\u00a0suspension of non-essential activities\u00a0in the public and private sectors until April 30 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The country has more than 1,500 cases and 50 deaths,\u00a0according to Johns Hopkins University. Grupo Modelo is ready to enact a plan to \"guarantee the supply of beer\" if the Mexican government decides to include breweries as essential, according to a statement. ##Business## Australia is threatening to kick out visitors who don't comply with the country's social distancing rules. At a news conference today, acting immigration minister\u00a0Alan Tudge had a blunt message for non-compliant travelers: \"A, you\u2019ll be in breach of state law for doing that and you can be fined. B, you\u2019ll be breaching your visa conditions and if we find that out we\u2019ll be kicking you out of the country. And then that will be a mark against your name for future visits to Australia. This is deadly serious,\u201d he said at a news conference today.  He also urged international tourists to leave the country. \u201cFor international tourists, take the next flight home, particularly if you don\u2019t have any family support,\"\u00a0he said.\u00a0\"The largest source of tourists in the country at the moment are from the United Kingdom. Next week alone there are 150 flights to London -- so there are those options for people to get home. And we ask them to exercise those options.\u201d Skilled visa holders: Australia has about 139,000 temporary skilled visa holders, who are often\u00a0invited to fill skills shortages, typically on two-year or four-year visas.\u00a0\u00a0 If these visa holders lose their job, they have 60 days to find a new one or leave. For those who have been stood down or had their hours reduced by the coronavirus measures, their visa will remain valid, Tudge said. Backpacker visas: There are about 118,000 people on \"backpacker\" visas who can work for six months for a single employer.\u00a0 If they work in critical industries, they can work longer than six months, Tudge said, and their visa will be extended for another year. New Zealanders: About half of the 600,000 New Zealanders in Australia won\u2019t have access to job seeker payments, but will have access to job keeper payments, Tudge added. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## Fiji confirmed five new cases of the coronavirus overnight -- the largest daily jump in the country so far, according to the government.

So she got creative and decided to have some fun -- by making her boyfriend the canvas for her masterful creations. Oley and Geoffrey Clark, who live in Atlanta, relocated to her family's secluded cabin in Ellijay, Georgia, a couple of weeks ago after she closed her salon due to the pandemic. She thought she'd use the spare time to watch tutorials and brush up on some new techniques, so Clark offered to be her test subject. And suddenly, inspiration struck. \"I picked up the curling iron and decided to turn him into George Washington,\" Oley told CNN. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, Oley has experimented with countless hairstyles on Clark. There's the on-point depiction of Princess Leia, complete with the iconic \"cinnamon buns\" on the sides and a white bedsheet to mimic her costume.

Instead, flags were lowered to half-staff this week for the nearly 15,000 coronavirus victims including doctors, nurses and health care professionals who have perished since February 23. Italy's wealthy northern provinces have taken the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak with more than 75% of overall cases and deaths north of Tuscany, in the center of the country,\u00a0per the Italian Civil Protection agency. Had the initial infection cluster started in the poorer southern regions, which do not have the same strong health care infrastructure, the crisis would have been even worse. But the southern regions are struggling, too: This is where organized crime syndicate hubs are based, and where unemployment hovers around 20% for adults and up to 50% for those under 24 during the best of times, according to figures from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Even with the outbreak in some southern communities affecting \"only\" a few thousand, the facilities are stretched and care for non-Covid patients has been severely compromised.

Allen Marshall spent Wednesday and Thursday at an Exxon station near the Detroit Medical Center with a sign that said: \"FREE GAS FOR NURSES.\" \"I just love them and I want them to know that,\"\u00a0he told CNN affiliate WDIV. Michigan is one of the hardest-hit US states in the coronavirus pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University,\u00a0with 10,791 cases and 417 deaths. Imran Al Samet works at the Exxon station and told CNN that Marshall had bought gas for between 50 and 80 people. Marshall\u00a0told The Detroit Free Press\u00a0that he'd been saving the money to buy a knife-sharpening tool. His wife is an essential worker at Blue Cross Blue Shield, the paper reported, so he did the giveaway after he dropped her off at work. \"Oh my goodness, that is so nice of him,\" one nurse, who wasn't identified, told WDIV. \"That's so good.

The inseparable couple had been married for more than 51 years and were living in Boynton Beach, Florida, in retirement. Neither of them had any serious health conditions. Then in mid-March, they started feeling ill. On Sunday, they both died -- six minutes apart -- due to complications from Covid-19, their son Buddy Baker said. Stuart Baker was 74. Adrian Baker was 72. The three weeks from infection to death: About three weeks ago, Stuart and Adrian went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well, according to Buddy. They were eventually sent home. A few days later, their symptoms still hadn't improved so their doctor recommended that they visit the hospital. They were also sent home and told to self-quarantine. After a few more days, on March 19, they were told to return to the hospital. Baker's father, who had a fever and asthma, was admitted. His mother, who did not have a fever, was not. On March 24, the hospital called -- Stuart had tested positive for Covid-19 and the doctor said it didn't look like he would make it. Buddy and his sister decided to take their mother to the hospital as a precautionary measure. Within 45 minutes of their mother being checked in, the doctor called to report that her oxygen levels were very low.  Buddy said he and his sister decided to move their parents to hospice care at the counsel of medical professionals. His mother and father were moved to the same room and taken off ventilators to be comfortable. Within minutes of each other, they had passed.

Joe, 42, died last weekend from complications with\u00a0coronavirus. Like other families across the US right now, Lewinger had to say goodbye to her husband virtually. When doctors told Lewinger her husband's breathing was getting worse and that he was on three different blood pressure medications, she requested to speak with Joe on FaceTime. \"I saw him and I begged him not to leave us and told him we all need him,\" Lewinger said. Doctors told her they'd try other methods to keep Joe alive. During that waiting period, Lewinger told CNN she listened to her wedding song on loop just staring into the backyard. Then the doctor called back. \"I played our wedding song for him. And then that was it,\" Lewinger said. Joe leaves behind his wife, a son and two daughters.

Most of them had long-term, pre-existing medical conditions, the Bureau of Prisons has said.  As of Friday, there were 91 inmates who have the coronavirus, including 18 in Oakdale, two in Lisbon and 20 in Danbury, Connecticut. An additional 50 prison staff members have also been confirmed with coronavirus. The federal prison system accounts for only a small percentage of the total number of incarcerated individuals in the US, numbering nearly 150,000 inmates across 122 facilities. State and locally owned prisons have been experiencing the spread of the virus behind bars and experimenting with early release programs too. ##Daily Life## When the novel coronavirus pandemic hit Asia, people across the region were quick to wear masks. Adoption has been far slower in the West, however, with England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty among a number of leading health officials to say that wearing them is unnecessary. Yet wearing masks in public hasn't always been an Asian proclivity. It certainly wasn't during the influenza pandemic of 1918, which lasted from January of that year to December 1920, and infected a third of the world's population, or about\u00a0500 million people, leading to about 50 million deaths -- about half a million of which were in the United States. Back then, it was the US that led the world in mask wearing, with the measure becoming mandatory there for the first time. History repeated in California: After San Francisco made masks mandatory in public in October 1918, an awareness campaign began. The campaign worked and other Californian cities followed suit, including Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, followed by states across the US. In a case of history repeating itself, this week the\u00a0mayor\u00a0of Los Angeles asked people to wear masks when shopping in public. So what changed? A century later, it is Asian countries that have adhered to the lessons the US learned about the benefits of mask wearing in slowing the spread of infection. Perhaps that is because in the intervening years, Asia has dealt with ongoing outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and other transmittable diseases, right up to SARS in 2003 and avian flu more recently. Those outbreaks have helped to maintain a mask-wearing culture. America and Europe have not seen similar outbreaks with such regularity.

A 56-year-old man died in the Dharavi slum, in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai, on Wednesday. He had no travel history, and died hours after testing positive for the coronavirus while being transferred to a local hospital, a Mumbai city official told CNN. Several of the man's family members have been tested and placed under home quarantine, and the block of 300 homes and 90 shops that make up his densely packed neighborhood have been sealed off to prevent further infections. On Thursday, a 52-year-old sweeper who works for the city's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in Dharavi also tested positive. A cluster in the slum could be disastrous. Home to about 1 million people, the Dharavi slum has a\u00a0population density\u00a0almost 30 times greater than New York City -- about 280,000 people per square kilometer. Doctors say the situation would be unmanageable if a sustained\u00a0outbreak spread rapidly through one of India's many slums, where there is little sanitation or running water and thousands of people live cheek by jowl -- making social distancing\u00a0physically and economically impossible.

The daily count of new coronavirus cases has doubled in the past week, from about 40 in the final days of March to 97 on Thursday and 89 on Friday, according to the\u00a0Tokyo Metropolitan Government. If the current trend continues, the outlook is bleak, said Kentaro Iwata, an infection control specialist from Kobe University, who has repeatedly warned that Japan isn't doing enough to halt the spread of the virus. \"Japan needs to have the courage to change, when we are aware we are on the wrong path,\" Iwata said. \"We might see the next New York City in Tokyo.\" New York is considered the epicenter of America's coronavirus outbreak. There, the number of known cases is doubling every five days,\u00a0according to a CNN count. More than\u00a02,900 people have died. As of Friday, Japan had 3,329 confirmed cases and 74 deaths. Iwata added there needs to be more testing: As of Friday, Tokyo had tested fewer than 4,000 people in a city of 13.5 million.  And just 39,466 people had been tested in this nation of 125 million, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. That's a tiny fraction compared to countries in the region and around the world.

It's not clear if the patients seem sicker because the virus is presenting itself in a different way, or if the patients are trying to wait it out at home, so they are already sicker by the time they arrive at the hospital. \"It just feels like the longer someone battles this virus and the more critically ill they become, the harder our job gets,\" Bradshaw said. \"The days are really, really long ...

The majority of states have issued orders for residents to stay in their homes, but the federal government has not mandated people do so. \u201cI leave it up to the governors,\u201d Trump said at Friday's coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cI guess we\u2019re close to 90% anyway,\u201d Trump said of the number of people mandated to stay home. At least 41 states and the District of Columbia have issued stay-at-home orders. \u201cStates that we\u2019re talking about are not in jeopardy,\u201d Trump said, referring to the handful of states that have not yet issued such orders. \u201cI like that from the standpoint of governing, and even from the standpoint of our Constitution,\u201d the President said of his inclination to allow states to make their own decisions about ordering people not to leave their houses. The federal government has issued guidance recommending that people stay home as much as possible and avoid gathering in groups larger than 10. ##Daily Life## There are at least\u00a0277,828 cases\u00a0of coronavirus in the US, with\u00a07,141 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the country.
