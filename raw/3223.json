Follow the latest developments from around the globe here. Beaches in Los Angeles and San Diego counties will remain closed this weekend to slow the spread of the coronavirus as a heatwave brings record warm temperatures to Southern California.  The continued closures have prompted local officials to remind the public to continue to stay home despite the temptation to hit the sand during the summer-like weather. In Los Angeles county, the\u00a0stay at home order\u00a0states that all public beaches, piers, public beach parking lots, and beach access points remain shuttered.  The closures could prompt Southern Californians to head to Ventura and Orange counties where most beaches are open, but parking lots and piers are closed to curb visits from out-of-towners. Both the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff are increasing patrols to enforce social distancing rules at beaches. Two lifeguard chiefs and\u00a0representatives with three law enforcement agencies praised Southern California residents for adhering to social distancing guidelines and for their cooperation. There has been a concerted effort among aides and allies to get President Trump to stop conducting the daily coronavirus briefings, multiple sources told CNN. Many close to him believe the daily briefings hurt him more than they help him. This comes after the White House spent the last 24 hours attempting to clean up remarks from the President that researchers should look into injecting people with disinfectant or ultraviolet rays to cure coronavirus. \"I see the disinfectant \u2014 where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?\" Trump asked Dr. Deborah Birx Thursday night. Trump left the briefing after just 22 minutes on Friday and took no questions from reporters after tweeting he would be holding a press conference.\u00a0 A source close to the coronavirus task force said Trump was upset about the \u201cflack\u201d he was taking after his comments about people injecting disinfectants as a coronavirus cure.\u00a0 One White House official said they asked the President to stop conducting the daily briefings last week but he resisted. Another ally told CNN that this concern is not new among those close to him. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis may withhold emergency funding from Weld County after a local leader said any business would be allowed to reopen on Monday.  \u201cIf any county is not treating this like the emergency that it is, they risk losing emergency funds,\u201d Polis said Friday at a news conference when asked about Weld County. The state is moving to what it calls a \u201cSafer at Home\u201d plan on Monday that involves loosening some restrictions, but the plan promoted by Weld County Commission Chairman Mike Freeman would allow all businesses to open with only suggested social distancing guidelines.\u00a0 \u201cWeld County is prepared to let all of its businesses, including those involving face to face transactions such as restaurants and retail establishments, to open on Monday,\u201d Freeman wrote on Facebook. Polis says the state is allowing local counties to request their own exceptions to the state\u2019s coronavirus restrictions, but he says Weld County has not even attempted to ask for a variance.\u00a0 In an interview with the Greeley Tribune in Weld County, Freeman said he considered tight coronavirus restrictions to be unenforceable.\u00a0 \u201cPeople are trying to do the right thing, but people have reached the end of their ropes,\u201d Freeman told the newspaper. \u00a0##Reopening## The Supreme Court denied a request Friday from New York and other states to block the Trump administration\u2019s controversial \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule during the pandemic. The rule makes it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. Earlier in the term, a 5-4 court said the rule could go into effect nationwide while legal challenges played out, but the states had asked the justices to reconsider that decision given the implications of the virus.\u00a0 The court denied the request with no noted dissents, but the justices did indicate the states could ask district courts for relief. Some context: New York, Connecticut, Vermont and New York City had filed one petition asking the justices to block the rule nationwide, arguing that while they are trying to stop the spread of Covid-19, the government\u2019s rule is deterring some immigrants from accessing health care and public benefits that are \u201cessential tools for protecting the public at large\u201d by limiting the \u201cspread and severity\u201d of the virus. \u201cSuch narrow and temporary relief\u201d is warranted, New York Attorney General Letitia James argued. In the petition, James provided examples of the impact of the rule on immigrants.  \u201cA physician in Connecticut has spoken with patients who had symptoms consistent with Covid-19,\u201d James wrote, \u201cbut were afraid to obtain COVID-19 testing or seek treatment due to concerns about the Public Charge Rule and fears that they could not afford to pay for treatment.\u201d She said the unwillingness for immigrants to come forward jeopardized their safety but also the public at large. There are at least\u00a0890,524\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a0at least\u00a051,107\u00a0people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases.\u00a0 On Friday, Johns Hopkins tallied\u00a021,579\u00a0new cases and\u00a01,130\u00a0reported deaths.\u00a0 The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories. The 2020 California State Fair and Food Festival has been cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, event organizers announced in a press release Friday. This year\u2019s event, which was scheduled for July 17-August 2 at Cal Expo in Sacramento, would have been the 166th\u00a0year of the award-winning fair. This is the first time the annual California State Fair has been canceled since WWII, Cal Expo said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the impact of Covid-19 will continue to be felt for the foreseeable future and that large gatherings should be postponed at this time,\u201d Cal Expo general manager and CEO Rick Pickering said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cCancelling this summer\u2019s California State Fair is the right thing to do, and is in line with the measured, scientific approach that\u2019s been implemented by the governor and health officials to fight Covid-19.\" More than 700,000 people were expected to attend this year\u2019s event, according to Cal Expo Deputy General Manager Margaret Mohr. The cancelation of the fair has a huge economic impact on Cal Expo and the region, she added.\u00a0 Cal Expo hires over 800 seasonal employees for the event each year. The venue for the event currently serves as a drive-thru coronavirus testing site, as well as a temporary emergency isolation trailer facilities for the homeless population, according to the press release. \u201cCalifornia Exposition and State Fair is a proud member of the statewide community and we will continue to do our part to combat COVID-19,\u201d Pickering said. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont slammed President Trump for his comments Thursday which suggested that disinfectant could be a treatment for coronavirus. \"It\u2019s incredibly unfortunate when somebody in such a position of power with a bully pulpit makes flip comments like that about ingesting these disinfectants and cleaning products and Lysol and such. It's absolutely wrong, it's dangerous,\" he said. Lamont added: \"And I urge each and every one of you, don't even take it as a bit of humor and sarcasm. Make sure your kids know that this is something that's dangerous and should not be allowed.\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has not set a deadline for when to reopen the state. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about specific dates as much as I\u2019m concerned about getting it right,\u201d DeSantis said at a news conference Friday. The governor\u2019s Reopen Task Force was scheduled to deliver their recommendations to DeSantis today. DeSantis said he plans to take a look at the task force\u2019s recommendations through the weekend and then roll out the plan in the \u201cnext many days.\u201d \u201cWhen that [the reopening] would start has absolutely not been determined yet,\u201d DeSantis said. ##Reopening## President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home COVID-19 test kit this week during the White House press briefing. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the at-home test was developed by LabCorp. Hahn said the test would require a doctor's referral.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a test where under certain circumstances with the doctor's supervision, a test can be mailed to a patient and they can perform the self-swab and then mail it back and get the results after that time, all under the guidance of a licensed physician,\u201d Hahn said. ##Testing## Vice President Mike Pence says the US has tested roughly 5.1 million Americans for coronavirus.  This update was provided moments ago during the White House coronavirus task force briefing. \"As of this morning, 5.1 million\u00a0Americans have been tested for\u00a0the coronavirus,\" Pence said. \"As testing increases\u00a0dramatically across the country,\u00a0cases will increase as well.\u00a0But people should not be\u00a0discouraged by those numbers.\" ##Testing## New York City has 10,746 confirmed coronavirus deaths and 5,102 probable coronavirus deaths,\u00a0according to the city website. The New York City Health Department defines probable deaths as people who did not have a positive Covid-19 laboratory test but their death certificate lists as the cause of death \u201cCovid-19\u201d or an equivalent. CNN reached out to the department Friday afternoon for an explanation on why the probable deaths dropped by 19 compared to yesterday. The total number of confirmed coronavirus deaths and probable coronavirus deaths in New York City is 15,848. There have been 146,139 coronavirus cases in the city and approximately 37,995 people have been hospitalized, according to the city. ##New York## Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, speaking about the shortages of personal protective equipment in his state, slammed Trump for delaying his use of the Defense Production Act. \"As you also know, I have been very robust in urging the President to get off the dime and start producing some PPE with the Defense Production Act,\" Inlsee said.\u00a0\"Unfortunately he waited weeks before he did that and so we've been delayed.\" The DPA gives Trump authority not only to order private companies to produce and expedite production of certain essential items \u2014 in this case, ventilators, masks and other essential medical resources \u2014 but also to allocate such materials.\u00a0 \"We've not had supplies that we would have liked and Republican and Democrat governors share that view and have for some period of time,\" Inlsee added. He said the federal government is \"starting to do a little more work to produce more PPE and we're grateful for that\" but he stressed that \"we need to continue to ramp up the manufacturing.\" Washington has\u00a085 million pieces of PPE that are \"in the queue or in the supply chain\" to the state, he said. Inlsee added that private\u00a0businesses\u00a0and prisons have also been working to make PPE for the state as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has instructed his surgeon general to give licensed pharmacists the power to order and administer Covid-19 tests. The governor made the announcement during a news conference Friday. DeSantis said the effort is a step towards making testing more \u201csimple\u201d and \u201caccessible\u201d in Florida. ##Testing## Former President Barack Obama says the US needs a comprehensive testing program \"if we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs,\" Obama said in a tweet today. By the numbers: The US is testing about 150,000 people per day. Germany, with a smaller population, is testing 120,000 per day, according to The New York Times. Harvard researchers have argued that unless the US could be testing\u00a0500,000 per day by May 1, the economy won't be able to open up. ##Testing## Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam does not anticipate reopening the state before May 8, he said in a news conference Friday. Northam outlined his \u201cForward Virginia\u201d plan and explained that phase one of reopening will require downward trends in new cases and hospitalizations for 14 days; increased testing and contact tracing and a sustainable supply of hospital beds and personal protective equipment. Northam compared the recovery to the aftermath of September 11. \u201cAmericans were fearful of getting on an airplane and flying, understandably so, and so a lot of modifications were made and in time people again became comfortable,\u201d Northam said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with all of our efforts.\u201d Northam said Virginia\u2019s goal is to eventually process 10,000 tests per day. The state processed 4,000 tests each of the last two days. Northam also said that he is not considering reopening the state by region or county. \u00a0##Reopening## Illinois has recorded 2,724 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the highest number of new cases in a single day, said Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike. This brings the total state count to 39,658 cases, Ezike said at a news conference Friday. \u201cYesterday we also saw the greatest number of test results that were reported in a 24 hour period, with over 16,000 specimens. Obviously when you test more people, you are going to find more cases,\u201d Ezike said. There were 4,828 people hospitalized and 25% of those patients were in intensive care, according to Ezike Ezike also announced 108 new Covid-19-related deaths, bringing the state total to 1,795. \u00a0 Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said on Friday he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d to hear that grocery stores are not making a greater effort to get all employees tested for Covid-19. Speaking at today\u2019s news briefing, Duggan warned that he will \u201ccrackdown\u201d on them if they fail to get all their workers tested by May 11.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe will take appropriate legal action to ensure that the residents of Detroit are safe,\u201d he said, adding that two weeks is plenty of time for grocery stores to get everyone tested.\u00a0 \u00a0##Testing## \u00a0 Missouri will begin loosening restrictions on businesses and some public gatherings beginning on May 4, Gov. Mike Parson said at a news conference Friday.\u00a0 \u201cSince Missouri's first case nearly 50 days ago, we have accomplished a tremendous amount of work together,\u201d the governor said. He said the \u201creopening\u201d will include restaurants, salons, gyms and houses of worship.\u00a0Details outlining social distancing measures will be released next week, the governor said. Parson said he is extending the state\u2019s coronavirus emergency declaration through June 15. \u201cExtending the emergency declaration simply allows us to continue using our resources and deploying them across the state,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Indiana Department of Health Commissioner Kristina Box acknowledged that she has received questions about the wisdom of ingesting disinfectant and has told these people it is not something she recommends. Sen. Mike Braun was more critical, saying, \u201csometimes when you\u2019re not clear with how you say things, and especially when you\u2019re at a high level where people watch, it\u2019s best probably not to venture into areas that you may not know a lot about.\u201d Gov. Eric Holcomb followed Box, repeating the President\u2019s explanation today that he was being sarcastic but also added the state will give sound medical counsel if anyone asks. \"Yeah and I would just add, apply those disinfectants to surfaces. They work. Not yourself,\" Holcomb said. \u00a0 California is unveiling a new program focused on caring for seniors while also getting farmers, restaurant workers and delivery people back to work.\u00a0 Touted as the first of its kind in the nation, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the program will focus on seniors who are particularly vulnerable and dealing with isolation.\u00a0 The program will allow for restaurants to reopen in order to prepare and deliver meals to seniors.  Elderly people meeting eligibility requirements, including financial means and vulnerability to coronavirus, will receive three meals a day, seven days a week. The meals will be made with an eye on locally-produced ingredients in an effort to put farmers back to work, and will follow nutritional guidelines, the governor said. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the meals. It\u2019s about the human connection,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s about someone just checking in as they\u2019re delivering those meals and making sure people are okay.\u201d ##Reopening## As of yesterday, Boston coronavirus cases were up by at least 398, for a total of 6,958, Mayor Marty Walsh announced. This is the city\u2019s largest one-day increase so far in the pandemic, he said. The city had 11 new coronavirus deaths for a total of 232. \u201cThese are certainly big increases, and we\u2019re approaching the peak of the coronavirus but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Walsh said.\u00a0 He added: \u201cWe do know that the measures we are taking in Boston are working. These numbers would be much higher if we had not taken very strong steps and if the folks in the communities haven\u2019t been social distancing, physical distancing, staying at home and doing everything that they have been for the last, say, six or eight weeks here.\" Because Maryland has yet to hit its Covid-19 peak and cases are still on the rise, the state is not ready to open back up for business, Gov. Larry Hogan said at a news conference this afternoon. Hogan said that the federal guidelines issued by President Trump last week called for states to meet specific gating metrics before considering lifting restrictions, including a 14-day downward trend in key numbers.  \u201cHere in Maryland we took some of the earliest and most aggressive actions in the nation to slow the spread of Covid-19, because of those efforts of everyone, we have far fewer cases, hospitalizations and deaths than all of the models were calling for,\" Hogan said. Maryland has not seen a \u201cspike\u201d in Covid-19-related illnesses and it is not ready to open,  Hogan said. \u201cWe have been successful in\u00a0flattening and lengthening the curve in our state, and we have not had the very high spikes that you have seen in other states. But that is also why we are several weeks behind those other states who spiked earlier, and the number of new cases of Covid-19 is still rising here in Maryland and throughout the Maryland, DC, and Virginia region, and by the federal standards instituted last week, and under the guidance given in the studies and reopening plans that we cited Maryland is not yet able to lift our restrictions,\" Hogan said. ##Reopening## A new study revealed that tens of thousands of Miami-Dade residents had Covid-19 and didn\u2019t even know it, Miami Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced during a news conference Friday. Gimenez said a random antibody testing study of some of the county\u2019s 2.8 million residents was recently conducted. About 1,800 people participated. The data showed 6% of the sample tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, which would be about 165,000 residents, he said. According to the Florida Department of Health, there are 10,701 coronavirus cases in Miami-Dade. That means that the actual number of cases, according to the study, is 16.5 times the number reported by the state, Gimenez said. Gimenez pointed out that this means a significant number of people were carrying coronavirus while being asymptomatic. He emphasized that social distancing restrictions are working.  \u201cIdentifying the number of asymptomatic individuals is critically important for public health,\u201d Gimenez said. \u201cLike I have said before those are the folks who can pass on the virus to the most vulnerable.\u201d\u00a0 The data also shows that black Americans might be twice as likely to be infected with Covid-19 than other racial groups, he said. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy will sign an executive order to support renters, the governor announced during a Covid-19 news conference today.\u00a0 The order will allow renters to use their security deposit to pay their rent, the governor said.\u00a0\u00a0 There will be a question and answer portal for tenants and landlords about their rights and responsibilities. President Trump lied Friday when he said he was being \"sarcastic\" when he asked medical experts on Thursday to look into the possibility of injecting disinfectant as a treatment for the coronavirus. Doctors and the company that makes Lysol and Dettol warned that injecting or ingesting disinfectants is dangerous. But when Trump was asked about the comments during a bill signing on Friday, he said, \"I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen.\" He then suggested he was talking about disinfectants that can safely be rubbed on people's hands. And then he returned to the sarcasm explanation, saying it was \"a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside.\" A reporter noted that he had asked his medical experts to look into it. Trump responded: \"No, no, no, no \u2014 to look into whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands, but whether or not sun can help us.\" Facts First: Trump was not being \"sarcastic\" on Thursday when he raised the possibility of injecting disinfectant. There was simply no indication that he was being anything less than serious. He was also wrong Friday when he denied he had asked the medical experts to \"check\" the idea of disinfectant injections; he was looking at them at the time. And he did not mention hands during his Thursday remarks. Here's what Trump said Thursday while looking in the direction of coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx and Department of Homeland Security science official Bill Bryan:  \"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds \u2014 it sounds interesting to me,\" Trump said. What happened on Thursday: Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, outlined tests in which he said disinfectants like bleach and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces. Bryan also spoke about how the virus was found to be negatively affected by exposure to UV rays and higher temperatures. Trump first spoke about the possibility of using light as a treatment for people who already have the coronavirus, musing that a \"very powerful light\" could be used to \"hit the body\" or be brought \"inside the body...either through the skin or in some other way.\"  Trump said Bryan had said he is going to \"test that.\" (Experts said this idea does not make sense; when Trump asked Birx if she has heard of the use of heat or light related to the virus, she said, \"Not as a treatment.\") Bryan said he would \"get to the right folks\" who could do testing. Trump then began his comments about disinfectant, which he concluded by saying \"it sounds interesting to me.\" Reminded by a reporter on Friday that he had been looking at Birx when he made these Thursday comments, Trump said he was looking at Bryan, Birx, but also \"some of the reporters.\" In fact, the video shows he was looking in the direction of Birx and Bryan for almost the entirety of his musings about disinfectant, glancing forward at reporters only very briefly. Later in the Thursday briefing, when a reporter asked Bryan if there is any scenario in which household cleaners could be injected into a person, Bryan said, \"No, I'm here to talk about the findings that we had in the study. We won't do that within that lab and our lab.\"  Trump then interjected: \"It wouldn't be through injection. We're talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work. But it certainly has a big effect if it's on a stationary object.\" Trump can argue that he walked back his comments during the briefing. But even in this more cautious follow-up, he offered no indication that he had been anything less than completely serious. The White House's initial statement on Friday about the disinfectant remarks did not say the President had been sarcastic. It only alleged that the media had taken him out of context. Watch:  The annual summer action sports and music festival X Games has been canceled. Originally set to take place July 17-19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, X Games organizers blamed the ongoing concerns of Covid-19 for the cancellation. X Games host Jack Mitrani announced the news via a video on Twitter.  Watch: \u00a0 Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order postponing the state's local elections until May 19, he announced today.  The two-week postponement is the maximum that Northam is constitutionally allowed after the state Senate declined to delay the elections further.\u00a0 \u201cElections are vital to democracy and so is the right to vote, but Virginians should not have to choose between their ballot and their health,\u201d Northam said at news conference Friday. The governor\u2019s statewide stay-at-home order is currently set to expire on June 10, which means the election might happen while the state is still under lockdown. Northam strongly encouraged voters to use absentee ballots and drew a comparison to Wisconsin when expressing his frustration with the situation. \u201cThe last thing that we want in Virginia is a scene like what we saw when Wisconsin held an election a few weeks ago. People waiting in line for hours, trying to social distance, just in order to vote,\u201d Northam said. The elections will decide local positions like mayors, town council members and school board members. \u00a0 The Department of Veterans Affairs said it is continuing to use hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus cases after the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration made clear Friday that the drug has not been shown to be \u201csafe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19,\u201d and carries \u201cknown risks\u201d of potentially deadly heart complications. The VA said it would the drug in a manner \u201cconsistent with current FDA guidance.\u201d  \"While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for COVID-19,\" the FDA said on Friday, \"there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered.\" The FDA said those risks \"may be mitigated when health care professionals closely screen and supervise these patients such as in a hospital setting or a clinical trial,\" which is mentioned in an emergency-use authorization for the drugs issued last month.\u00a0 Asked whether the VA believes veterans should use hydroxychloroquine going forward, VA spokesperson Christina Noel said the department is using \u201cit to treat COVID-19 in cases where Veteran patients and their providers determine it is medically necessary, and in a manner consistent with current FDA guidance.\u201d Noel pointed to a part of the FDA guidance that allows the drug to be used for treatment temporarily during the pandemic in hospitalized patients. CNN previously reported coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation and had higher deaths rates compared to those who did not take the drug, according to a study of hundreds of patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centers. The study, which reviewed veterans' medical charts, was posted Tuesday on\u00a0medrxiv.org, a pre-print server, meaning it was not peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia. \"In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19,\" the authors wrote. There are currently no products approved by the FDA to prevent or treat Covid-19, although research is underway on many drugs. \u00a0 There has been a \"big increase\" in 911 calls for domestic abuse in the past few weeks, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said during a news conference on Friday. \"Not everybody is safe at home and unfortunately that seems to be doubly true now,\" Raimondo said. She encouraged people who are not safe to reach out for help and said that those who are safe need to pay attention to their communities.\u00a0 The state is reviewing data and resources to help combat this uptick in domestic violence, Raimondo said. President Trump tweeted that he \u201cwill never let our Post Office fail\u201d after attacking the US Postal Service earlier Friday. Trump criticized the USPS in his tweet saying, \u201cIt has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology\u201d but goes on to praise those who work for the postal service.  \u201cThe people that work there are great, and we\u2019re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!\u201d Trump tweeted. During today\u2019s bill signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Trump called the Postal Service \u201ca joke\u201d and claimed it needed to raise rates on companies like Amazon by four or five times. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters earlier \"we authorized in the last CARE[S] Act over $10 billion in a loan.\" \"My team is already actively working on that with the postal service, if they need the money. And we\u2019re dealing with them,\" he said. Mnuchin went on to say that \u201ccertain criteria for postal reform\u201d would be included as part of that loan. Trump then added that if the USPS doesn\u2019t raise the price on packages, he won\u2019t sign any legislation to provide it more funding.\u00a0 Admiral Michael Gilday, the chief of Naval Operations, has\u00a0recommended to Defense Secretary Mark Esper today that Capt. Brett Crozier be restored to command of the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, according to an administration official tells CNN. A defense official also said that Esper was not prepared to immediately accept the Navy\u2019s recommendation after being briefed on the investigation\u00a0on Friday, telling top Navy officials he wanted more time to review their recommendations. More on this: Crozier was\u00a0relieved of his command after sending a letter warning that action was needed to save the lives of his crew from an\u00a0outbreak of coronavirus\u00a0aboard the aircraft carrier. In the memo, Crozier pleaded with Navy leaders that \"decisive action is required\" to remove a majority of the ship's personnel and isolate them for two weeks. The letter was published in the San Francisco Chronicle. Watch sailors cheer on Capt. Crozier in send-off: Ohio will scale up testing to 22,000 tests per day by the end of May, Gov. Mike DeWine announced in a news conference on this afternoon. DeWine said the state struck a partnership with a dental supply company to manufacture\u00a0swabs, and with a medical manufacturing company to supply reagents for the tests \u2014 which both have been major obstacles for Ohio's testing expansion. Currently, Ohio's daily testing capacity is 3,728. DeWine said that by Wednesday, the state should get to\u00a07,200 tests per day, and by May 27, that number should reach 22,000 tests per day. DeWine said testing will be prioritized for nursing homes, essential workers and hotspots.\u00a0 \"We'll also be able to focus on other congregate care living settings, homeless shelters, treatment centers, developmental disability homes. Next, will be able better able to make sure food and grocery workers and employees and essential manufacturing in Ohio are healthy and not spreading disease,\" he said.\u00a0 DeWine did not provide any additional details about the state's reopening plan, which is expected to be announced on Monday.\u00a0 ##Testing## \u00a0 Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced on Friday that elective dental procedures will be allowed to proceed on May 18.  The state's Department of Health will be working with industry associations on proper guidelines so consumers have confidence that protective measures are in place before May 18, the governor said. Hutchinson also announced that the total number of coronavirus cases in the state rose to 2,741 in total, which includes 198 new cases at the Arkansas Department of Corrections Cummins unit. The state has also pushed for additional testing and had over 2,800 tests come in over the past day.  \u00a0##Reopening## \u00a0 The UFC has scheduled three fight nights that will be closed to the public starting May in Jacksonville, Florida. The mixed martial arts organization said all thee of the events will take place in the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena\u00a0\"with only essential personnel in attendance.\" In a statement released by the UFC, Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry said,\u00a0\u201cAs we move step-by-step on the path toward economic recovery, we are proud to host these UFC events at the Vystar Veterans Memorial Arena.\u201d The televised UFC 249 will take place on May 9 with additional fight nights on May 13 and 16, the UFC said. Each event will be\u00a0\"closed to the public.\" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0on Friday\u00a0issued a reminder about disinfectants: Use them properly. \u201cHousehold cleaners and disinfectants can cause health problems when not used properly. Follow the instructions on the product label to ensure safe and effective use,\" the CDC said in a\u00a0tweet. Some context: The CDC message was sent a day after President Trump suggested\u00a0that injecting disinfectant\u00a0might be a possible treatment for coronavirus. \u201cI see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute.\u00a0One minute,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,\u201d the President added. \u201cBecause you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs.\u00a0So it would be interesting to check that.\u201d The CDC tweet\u00a0included a link for anyone interested in learning \u201cmore about cleaning and disinfecting your home.\u201d Among other instructions. the CDC website says people should try \u201cnot to breathe in product fumes. If using products indoors, open windows and doors to allow fresh air to enter.\u201d CNN has reached out to the CDC for clarification on what prompted the tweet. Earlier today, The maker of Lysol issued a\u00a0statement clarifying that under no circumstances should its products be administered into the human body. See Dr. Birx's reaction to Trump's disinfectant suggestion: US airlines are moving forward with plans to carry cargo in otherwise empty passenger planes.\u00a0 Airlines for America, the industry group that represents airlines, on Friday formally asked the Federal Aviation Administration to allow all carriers to transport cargo on airplane seats.\u00a0 Delta Air Lines said it has received federal government approval to carry cargo in empty overhead bins on cargo-only, wide-body charter flights.\u00a0Since early April, it has been using passenger planes for those flights, but the passenger compartment is empty.\u00a0\u00a0 What we know: The airlines are proposing carrying up to 50 pounds of cargo on each seat \u2014 or up to 110 pounds if the cargo is packaged in a single container that takes up three seats.\u00a0They propose carrying up to 20 pounds of cargo under each seat.\u00a0The seats will be in the upright position, rather than reclined, and flight attendants would be aboard to make sure none of the cargo catches fire.\u00a0(Passenger compartments typically don\u2019t have the firefighting systems installed in cargo compartments.)\u00a0 Some airlines are also looking at removing passenger seats, providing even more cargo capacity.\u00a0Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on a call with financial analysts earlier this week:\u00a0\u201cWe are \u2014 we have looked at and we're taking some of the main deck seats off our \u2014 a few of our international planes to facilitate taking greater lift in the short term.\u201d\u00a0 The 80% cut in US flights means there is significantly less cargo capacity available to shippers.\u00a0\u00a0 Earlier this month, the FAA laid out the standards airlines must meet when seeking approval to carry cargo in non-traditional areas.\u00a0Details on that below.\u00a0\u00a0 Here's a diagram from Airlines for America showing how cargo would be placed on seats:\u00a0 \u00a0 Three class action lawsuits have been filed against New York-area universities by students who\u00a0argue the schools\u2019 have failed to adequately refund or reimburse students for tuition and other fees they paid to attend in-person, on-campus classes. The lawsuits are against Columbia University, Pace University and Long Island University. The students argue that online-only instruction is less valuable and should cost students less. Pace University spokesperson Marie Boster told CNN that while they have not been served yet, \u201chousing fee adjustments for students who had to leave the residence halls are being issued. We are planning to use CARES Act funding to support our students when it is available.\u201d Columbia University and Long Island University have not yet responded to comment. ##New York## Delaware schools will remain closed through the end of the academic year, Gov. John Carney announced on Friday.\u00a0 \u201cToday we're making it official that the schools will remain closed for students through the end of this school year,\u201d Carney said.\u00a0\u201cThere's obviously no replacement for in person instruction in classrooms in terms of the relationships and the services.\u00a0But obviously doing what we can between now and the end of what would have been the school year, we want to get as much benefit for our students as possible.\u201d The governor also encouraged superintendents to begin planning for summer learning and instruction, summer food distribution, and preparation for the new school year.\u00a0 \u00a0##Reopening## President Trump attacked the US Postal Service, calling it \u201ca joke\u201d during Friday\u2019s Oval Office bill signing ceremony. Trump said that the postal service needs to raise the price of a package, \u201capproximately four times\u201d because they are currently losing money delivering packages for Amazon \u201cand other internet companies.\u201d \u201cThe Postal Service is a joke, because they are handing out packages for Amazon and other internet companies, and every time they bring a package, they lose money on it,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Trump said that the Postal Service is \u201cvery cozy with some of these companies\u201d which is why, according to Trump, they wont raise the price on packages. \u201cBut they don't want to raise, because they don't want to insult Amazon and they don't want to insult other companies, perhaps, that they like. The post office should raise the price of the packages to the companies, not to the people, to the companies and if they did that, it would be a whole different story,\u201d Trump said. Some background: The Postal Service is a government agency, but it operates as an independent business without direct taxpayer support. It has lost $65 billion over the last 11 fiscal years. Amazon has a confidential agreement with the Postal Service where it delivers large numbers of packages directly to the post office nearest to where they need to be delivered. The Postal Service then delivers the packages the \"last mile\" to their destinations. The Postal Service says the law requires that such negotiated contracts cover its costs, and that regulators have studied the Amazon contract and approved it. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that there was a $10 million loan provided to the USPS in the CARES Act, but \u201ccertain criteria for postal reform\u201d would be included as part of that loan.\u00a0 Trump added that if the USPS doesn\u2019t raise the price on packages, he won\u2019t sign anything for more funding for the postal service. Watch: President Trump reiterated Friday that he didn\u2019t know Dr. Rick Bright, the dismissed director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority\u00a0(BARDA), an office leading the charge on a coronavirus vaccine. \u201cUntil yesterday, I never heard of the gentleman,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. \u201cI guess they moved him to a different group.\u201d Asked if he had any plans to look into Bright\u2019s move to a narrower position at the National Institutes of Health, Trump suggested he will. \u201cI have not yet, at some point I will,\u201d he said. Bright has alleged that his ouster was retaliatory and stemmed in part from his opposition to widening the availability of a coronavirus treatment with dubious scientific merits that\u00a0the President had repeatedly promoted. Watch: \u00a0 President Trump Friday signed into a law a roughly $480 billion package to deliver aid to small businesses and hospitals and expand Covid-19 testing, the latest attempt by Washington to blunt the devastating impact of the pandemic. The total price tag of the funding package is approximately $484 billion. It will add to the already historic levels of spending to deal with the pandemic by authorizing an additional $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was set up to help small businesses struggling from the economic deep freeze triggered by coronavirus.  Funding for the program ran dry earlier this month, prompting an outcry from the business community. ##Stimulus## Watch the moment here:   \u00a0 More than 400,000 people in Tennessee have filed unemployment claims, Gov. Bill Lee announced at a news conference on Friday. The claims add up to about 15% of the state\u2019s workforce.\u00a0 Lee also said the state suffered an $870 million loss in revenue in March, and that state officials predict a $5 billion loss to Tennessee\u2019s GDP in 2020. Yesterday, the US Department of Labor\u00a0 announced that first-time claims for unemployment benefits totaled 4.4 million in the week ending April 18, after factoring in seasonal adjustments. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced plans to start reopening some sectors of the economy on Monday during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 During Friday's news conference, Reynolds said the proclamation she is signing will allow for hospitals to resume elective surgeries in a phased approach. Farmers Markets will also be able to reopen with limited operations on Monday as well. Iowa recorded 521 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the state total to 4,445, Reynolds said.  The state also reported 11 additional deaths, bringing the total to 107. The deaths include residents from long-term care facilities and those with pre-existing conditions, Reynolds said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at her weekly press conference criticized President Trump over his suggestion that sunlight and injecting disinfectants could help cure coronavirus and linked the comments to recent comments from Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell suggesting that he thinks that bankruptcy and not more federal money might be best for state and local governments. \u201cThe President is asking people to inject Lysol into their lungs and Mitch is saying that states should go bankrupt. It\u2019s a clear, visible, within 24 hours, of how the Republicans reject science and reject governance. If you don\u2019t believe in science and you don\u2019t believe in governance. That\u2019s their approach \u2026 we know that governance has a role and we know that science as a role and without science in our decision making we are not going to be on a very successful path,\" she said. She went on to say, \u201cunfortunately we\u2019re seeing Republicans make comments with zero connection to science and facts. Just put that behind us and let\u2019s go forward in a way that gets the job done for the American people. I\u2019ve mentioned the President and his, let\u2019s say, we can kill the virus by injecting disinfectants like Lysol into the body. Clearly and sadly, the President is not listening to medical experts. I don\u2019t know which ones he is listening to if any.\u201d Wearing a bandana around her neck, but not covering her face, Pelosi called the climbing coronavirus death count \u201cstaggering,\u201d saying that \u201cmany people, as am I, are quite shaken by the fact that we have passed the 50,000 number of people who have died from the coronavirus mark.\u201d  Pelosi noted that it has hit close to home for some members of Congress. \u201cWe heard Maxine\u2019s sister is dying,\u201d she said in a reference to Rep. Maxine Waters. On Thursday, Waters said her sister is dying of coronavirus in a hospital in St Louis, Missouri. During his daily briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he received a letter from a retired Kansas farmer, enclosed with one N95 mask. The farmer asked Cuomo to give it to a New York health care worker on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cIt's that love, that courage, that generosity of spirit that\u00a0makes this country so\u00a0beautiful \u2026 That generosity of\u00a0spirit, for me, makes up for all\u00a0the ugliness that you see,\u201d Cuomo said.\u00a0 The farmer, Dennis, said he and his wife, Sharon, are in their 70s, and she has only one lung, along with diabetes. While he is keeping four masks for his family, he wanted a doctor or nurse to have one of the masks left over from his farming days.  \"How beautiful is that? I mean, how selfless is that? How giving is that?\" Cuomo said, adding, \"God bless America.\"  Watch: ##New York## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was just asked about President Trump\u2019s comments yesterday, asking if it was possible to treat coronavirus with sunlight or a \u201cinjection\u201d of disinfectants, such as Lysol. Here's how Cuomo responded:  \"I don't know much about UV rays. Not my job, not my business, not my education, not my background.\" Cuomo then asked the state's Health Commissioner Howard Zucker to respond. \"These are chemicals you would not ingest,\" Zucker said of bleach and other disinfectants. \"We make sure our kids do not go into cabinets that have these chemicals in them, so we need to stay away from those products,\" Zucker added. Remember: The maker of Lysol issued a\u00a0statement today clarifying that under no circumstances should its products be administered into the human body. \"As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),\" the company\u00a0said in a statement. ##New York## New York will suffer a $13.3 billion shortfall due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his daily news conference. State revenues will decline by $61 billion from the 2021 fiscal year to the 2024 fiscal year, he said.  \"New York state was not 'in trouble' before this\u00a0happened.\u00a0New York state was very, very\u00a0strong before this happened.\u00a0Our economy was growing, it was\u00a0growing at a very high rate.\u00a0Our government spending has been\u00a0at record lows ...\u00a0And then this economic tsunami\u00a0hits, and you shut down all the\u00a0businesses, everybody stays\u00a0home, they're not getting a\u00a0paycheck, they feel economic\u00a0anxiety,\" Cuomo said. \"The consequence to the state is\u00a0the revenue projections are way\u00a0down,\" he added. Watch: ##New York## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that reopening the state's economy too soon could have a devastating impact and could potentially erase any progress made.  The governor said while the number of cases is decreasing, state officials \"have to be smart\" about reopening businesses. He warned: \"All the\u00a0progress\u00a0we made is\u00a0gone, and all experts, or\u00a0virtually all experts, will say\u00a0not only does the virus spread\u00a0increase, but it increases to a\u00a0higher point than we had\u00a0increased the first time.\u00a0Again, this is a remarkably\u00a0effective virus at spreading and\u00a0growing. So I know everyone is impatient.\u00a0Let's just reopen.\u00a0That's what happens if we just\u00a0reopen.\" Watch: ##Reopening## ##New York## There were 422 deaths from coronavirus in New York state on Thursday, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \u201cAgain, this is at an unimaginable level, and it\u2019s dropping somewhat but still devastating news,\u201d Cuomo said. \u00a0 The number is down slightly: There were 438 deaths in the state on Wednesday. \u00a0 ##New York## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said evidence suggests the state is \"on the downside of the curve.\" New hospitalizations and intubations continue to decline, the governor said at his daily news conference.  \"All the evidence suggests we're on the downside of the curve,\" he said.\nWatch: \n##New York## As Georgia businesses start to reopen today and into next week, business owners are expressing caution while also saying they need to open their doors in order to survive financially.  Mario Zelaya, CEO of Bad Axe Throwing, said most small business owners do not want to open up but they are compelled to do so, because of lease agreements and financial instability.\u00a0 \u201cI think what the public\u00a0really needs to realize is no\u00a0one wants to open up.\u00a0As business owners, we are all\u00a0worried, we're scared, we're\u00a0anxious.\u00a0It's not something we're proud\u00a0of doing.\u00a0We are kind of waging our own\u00a0war against survival,\u201d Zelaya said.\u00a0 Greg Smith, who owns a gym in Martinez, Georgia, told CNN\u2019s John King that he\u2019s taking measures such as spacing out equipment by 10 feet, checking customers\u2019 temperatures and buying an air filtration system.\u00a0 Smith said a few clients have expressed concerns but he thinks he\u2019ll be able to keep a safe experience.\u00a0 Lester Crowell, owner of a hair salon in Marietta, Georgia, said he consulted with his employees about coming back to work. About half said they would return this week, and Crowell said the salon will be back to regular hours next week.\u00a0 \u201cI definitely have hesitation.\u00a0I'm anxious, I'm scared, I'm\u00a0excited all at once.\u00a0I'm just trying to rely on the\u00a0advice of our local government,\u201d Crowell said.\u00a0 ##Georgia## ##Reopening## A US Navy destroyer performing counter narcotics mission\u00a0has an outbreak of coronavirus, with 18 cases reported, a US Navy official tells CNN.\u00a0\u00a0 The Pentagon has confirmed that there has been a coronavirus outbreak on the USS Kidd, with more than one sailor testing positive. The ship is assigned to the Caribbean/Eastern Pacific mission.\u00a0 The first sailor that tested positive was taken off the ship when he displayed symptoms, according to Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman. He tested positive at a medical treatment facility in San Antonio, Texas. There have since been other sailors on the ship who have tested positive.\u00a0 \u201cThey are preparing to return to port, where they will undertake efforts to clean the ship. They will remove a portion of the crew from the ship. And work to get everybody back to health and get the ship back to sea,\u201d Hoffman said. A Navy medical team is conducting contact tracing and isolating individuals who may have been exposed, according to Hoffman.\u00a0 \u00a0 Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee outlined today the first steps from the \u201cTennessee Pledge,\u201d the state\u2019s guidance for reopening businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. These guidelines apply to 89 of the state's 95 counties. The first industries to receive guidance through the plan include the restaurant and retail industries. According to the plan.... On Monday: Restaurants are able to reopen at 50% occupancy. \nOn Wednesday: Tennessee retailers are able to reopen at 50% occupancy.  The state recommends that employees in both industries wear cloth face coverings and that business owners follow federal guidelines for hygiene and workplace sanitation standards related to the pandemic. You can read the full full guidance offered by the state\u00a0here. \u201cTennesseans pulled together to flatten the curve, and it is time for people to begin to get back to work and back to their businesses,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe are pursuing a careful, measured approach to reopening our economy that does not depend on heavy-handed mandates but instead provides practical tools for businesses of all sizes.\u201d Previously, Lee said that his administration will work with some of the state's most populated counties and their health departments as they plan their own reopening strategies. This includes counties surrounding Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga and Knoxville. ##Reopening## There are at least\u00a050,031\u00a0reported deaths from coronavirus in the US, \u00a0according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of deaths in the United States.\u00a0 On Friday morning, Johns Hopkins is reporting at least 870,468 coronavirus cases in the United States.\u00a0 President Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration is \u201cpursuing some kind of liability safeguard program\u201d for businesses that reopen that would protect them from coronavirus-related lawsuits. There would be exceptions for gross negligence, he said during an appearance on Fox Business this morning. \u201cIf you\u2019re just open in business and you conform to the guidelines\u201d and a customer or employee contracted coronavirus, \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be a lawsuit,\" he said. Trump said he'd look into this kind of safeguard when asked in a briefing last week. Kudlow declined to say what he\u2019d like to see in the next round of relief package, but said there needs to be an \u201cincentive-oriented program\u201d to encourage US businesses to work and take risks.  Kudlow projected positive growth in the third quarter and \u201ceven more positive growth\u201d in the last quarter of 2020. ##Reopening## \u00a0 The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned against the use of two drugs that have been touted by President Trump as potential treatments for novel coronavirus. The agency said the drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,\u00a0should only be used in hospital settings or clinical trials because of the potential\u00a0for\u00a0serious side effects. The agency said it was aware of reports of \u201cserious heart rhythm problems\u201d in Covid-19 patients treated with the drugs, often in combination with azithromycin or other medications that can affect the heart.\u00a0 \u201cWe are also aware of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cTherefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.\u201d Trump has mentioned the closely related drugs nearly 50 times since mid-March, according to a CNN analysis of his public comments. The President has said the drugs would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against coronavirus, but a growing body of evidence suggests they may not\u00a0help\u00a0Covid-19 patients\u00a0at all, and may do more harm than good.\u00a0 \u201cHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,\u201d the FDA said on Friday. The agency said it was monitoring serious side effects in coronavirus patients who took the drugs, either alone or combined with the antibiotic azithromycin or other drugs. \u201cThese adverse events included abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation, dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and in some cases, death,\u201d the agency said. \"We understand that health care professionals are looking for every possible treatment option for their patients and we want to ensure we're providing them with the appropriate information needed for them to make the best medical decisions,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhile clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for COVID-19,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are known side effects of these medications that should be considered.\u201d In its statement, the FDA said those risks \u201cmay be mitigated when health care professionals closely screen and supervise these patients such as in a hospital setting or a clinical trial,\u201d which is mentioned in an emergency use authorization for the drugs issued last month by the FDA. \u201cHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria,\u201d the agency said, adding that hydroxychloroquine is also approved for certain autoimmune conditions such as lupus. Patients\u00a0taking\u00a0the drugs for their approved\u00a0indications\u00a0should continue taking their medications as prescribed, the FDA said. \u201cThe benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks at the recommended doses for these conditions.\u201d \u00a0 President Trump claims he and Vice President Mike Pence, \u201cnever\u00a0gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines,\u201d as the state's aggressive reopening plan begins. \u201cFAKE NEWS!,\u201d Trump wrote on twitter. \u201cSpas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, & barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (& USA)!\u201d CNN\u2019s previous reporting from Jim Acosta, Kristen Holmes and Dana Bash is that Trump and Pence told Kemp via telephone that they supported his decision on reopening the state and praised his work as governor, according to a separate source with knowledge of the call.\u00a0 But the President \u2014 around the time Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus task force coordinator, met with Trump \u2014 had a second call with Kemp, according to two sources familiar with the situation.  The call was brief and struck an entirely different tone than the first: Trump asked the governor to slow down his reopening plan, to which Kemp said no, according to the sources. The President said he'd call Kemp back later to discuss, but never did. To the relief of members of the task force, Trump proceeded to say he disagreed with Kemp's decision during Wednesday\u2019s coronavirus briefing. ##Georgia## ##Reopening## Vice President Pence said that he thinks \u201cby Memorial Day weekend we will largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us\u201d in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera.  Pence emphasized that the White House\u2019s recommended \u201cphased approach\u201d is the best way to ensure there is not a resurgence of the virus. President Trump also retweeted Rivera about the interview with Pence, in which the radio host expressed some skepticism over the projection. \"If--as @VP tells me on our radio interview this morning--the worst is behind us & entire epidemic will be largely behind us by Memorial Day--less than a month away. It's @realDonaldTrump Administration's most optimistic projection. Mike Pence sticks his neck out-Hope he's right,\" Rivera wrote.\u00a0 Dr. Anthony Fauci yesterday warned that he is \u201cnot overly confident\u201d about the current testing capacity in the US, which governors need before they are able to reopen their states.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Reopening## Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will extend the state\u2019s stay-at-home order until at least May 15, according to her spokesperson Zack Pohl. The governor will hold a news conference to announce the extension at 11 a.m. ET, Pohl said. ##Reopening## White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a statement Friday claiming that President Trump has \"repeatedly\" said Americans should consult their doctors on coronavirus treatments.\u00a0 This comes after fallout from Trump\u2019s comments yesterday, asking if it was possible to treat coronavirus with sunlight or a \u201cinjection\u201d of disinfectants. \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday\u2019s briefing.\u00a0Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines,\u201d McEnany said in a statement. Some background: Here's what President Trump said yesterday about \u201ccleaning the lungs\u201d with disinfectants:\u00a0 \u201cSupposing we hit the body with a tremendous, if it's ultraviolet or very powerful light. And I think he said that hasn't been checked but he was going to test it. Then I said what it if you brought the light inside of the body which you could do either through the skin or some other way and I think you said you were going to test that, too. Sounds interesting. Then I see the disinfectant, knocks it out in one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning because you see it gets on the lungs. That you're gonna have to use medical doctors. Because it sounds interesting. The way the light killed that in one minute is pretty powerful.\u201d Following the remarks, the company that makes Lysol urged customers not to consume its cleaning products. US stocks opened in positive territory despite all three major stock indexes on track to finish the week lower. During the coronavirus pandemic, stocks have tended to lose steam into the weekend. Investors are reluctant to hold onto their positions while exchanges are closed, experts say. Here's where things stand now: The Dow kicked off 0.7%, or 174 points, higher.\nThe S&P 500 opened up 0.6%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4% at the opening bell. \u00a0You can follow live updates on the markets here. Public Beaches in Sarasota County, Florida, will reopen on Monday for \"essential\" recreational activities, according to Nicole Rissler,\u00a0director\u00a0of Parks, Recreation and Natural Resources in\u00a0Sarasota County. Sarasota County commissioners voted unanimously yesterday to reopen beaches for... Fishing\nRunning\nWalking\nSwimming \nSurfing Playgrounds, tennis/basketball courts and beach pavilions will remain closed.\u00a0No coolers, tents, umbrellas or chairs will be allowed. Congregating is also banned, and all parking near beaches will remain closed. The city of Jacksonville reopened beaches last weekend. Meanwhile, a Florida Task Force is expected to issue recommendations to Governor DeSantis today for reopening the state of Florida.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Reopening## The Infectious Diseases Society of America warned that we don\u2019t know enough about antibody testing to assume immunity. \u201cWe do not know whether or not patients who have these antibodies are still at risk of reinfection with Covid-19. At this point, I think we have to assume that they could be at risk of reinfection,\" Dr. Mary Hayden, spokesperson for IDSA and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Rush University Medical Center, said at a briefing today. \u201cWe don't know even if the antibodies are protective, what degree of protection they provide, so it could be complete, it could be partial, or how long the antibodies last,\u201d Hayden added, \u201cWe know that antibody responses wane over time.\u201d\u00a0 The society is \u201crecommending that people with antibodies not change their behavior in any way and continue social distancing.  \u201cHaving antibodies is not a license to stop the mitigation guidelines and rules that are affected in many states,\u201d Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, spokesperson for IDSA and chief of infectious diseases at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center said. \u201cWe need to stay inside if we're not essential workers, we need to stay six feet away from people and we cannot cluster and having an antibody is not a license today on April 24, to break with that policy,\u201d Pirofski said.\u00a0 Some background: A preliminary study of 3,000 New Yorkers found that 13.9% tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said yesterday. And 21% of people tested in New York City had antibodies for the virus. ##Testing## The beaches in Bay County, Florida, are officially back open as of today with limitations during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The beaches reopened just one day after the\u00a0Bay County Board of Commissioners approved an emergency order allowing recreational use of county beaches during the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. ET, according to the ordinance. The commissioners said beachgoers should still follow all strict social distancing rules while enjoying the sun.\u00a0 Last week, beaches in Jacksonville, Florida, reopened with similar limitations. Gov. Ron DeSantis supported the idea of reopening beaches, parks and other public spaces as long as social distancing is practiced, WJXT reported. \"You look at how this disease is transmitted, it's transmitted overwhelmingly when you are in close, sustained contact with people, usually in an indoor environment,\" DeSantis said. \"Going forward, we got to be promoting people to get exercise, do it in a good way, to do it in a safe way.\" ##Reopening## Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she feels like \"we're living in the twilight zone\" as she now has to advise people not only to stay at home but to also not inject themselves with Lysol.\u00a0 \"In a normal world, we'd be able to look to our President and to the White House and receive sound guidance and advice, but instead we're now telling \u2014 having to tell people not to ingest and inject your body with household cleaners,\" she said on CNN's New Day this morning.  \"These are strange times that we're living in. And I just hope that people will exercise common sense,\" she added. What this is about: Yesterday, President Trump suggested the possibility of injecting disinfectants to protect people from coronavirus.  \"And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning ... it would be interesting to check that,\" Trump at a briefing.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt sounds interesting to me,\u201d he added. Remember: The maker of Lysol issued a\u00a0statement today clarifying that under no circumstances should its products be administered into the human body. \"As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),\" the company\u00a0said in a statement.

But Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she's telling people to stay home despite Gov. Brian Kemp's orders. \"Nothing has changed. People are still getting infected. People are still dying. We don't have a cure to this virus,\" she said on CNN. \"The only thing that helped us is that we have stayed apart from one another, and I'm simply asking people to continue to do that,\" she added. However, Bottoms said she still expects some people not to listen to the science.  \"They will go into hair salons and go and get manicures and pedicures as if it is business as usual, and then in a couple of weeks we will see our numbers continue to rise is in this state,\" she said. ##Georgia## ##Reopening## It's morning in the US, and the coronavirus death toll across the country nears 50,000, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. Here's the news you need to know to start the day: Don't drink Lysol: The company that makes Lysol is urging customers not to consume its cleaning products after President Trump suggested the possibility of injecting disinfectants to protect people from coronavirus. \nWhat Trump said about disinfectants: \"And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in one minute.

It now goes to President Trump. ##Georgia## ##Reopening## ##Testing## ##Stimulus## Undeterred by a barrage of criticism, Georgia state officials moved ahead today with plans to allow some nonessential businesses to reopen, even as\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0deaths increase statewide. Gov. Brian Kemp was one of the last state leaders\u00a0to issue a stay-at-home order, effective April 3, to combat the spread of Covid-19. These are some of the businesses allowed to reopen today: Gyms\nBarber shops\nHair salons\nTattoo parlors\nBowling alleys What the experts are saying: Georgia should not even begin to reopen\u00a0until June 22, according to the model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which assumes states will implement aggressive testing, contact tracing, isolation and crowd-size limits to prevent more infections. ##Georgia## ##Reopening## The maker of Lysol issued a\u00a0statement Friday clarifying that under no circumstances should its products be administered into the human body, after US President Donald Trump suggested the possibility of injecting disinfectants to treat the coronavirus. Manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser said that the range of disinfectants and cleaners must not enter the body \"through injection, ingestion or any other route.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe have a responsibility in providing consumers with access to accurate, up-to-date information\u00a0as advised by leading public health experts,\u201d the company said. The statement followed\u00a0remarks\u00a0from President Trump on Thursday on the use of disinfectants. \"And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning ... it would be interesting to check that,\" Trump said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt sounds interesting to me,\u201d he added. CNN\u2019s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was quick to point out that this is simply wrong. \u201cHe also said it needs to be studied. Actually, it doesn\u2019t. I mean we know the answer to this one,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper 360 on Thursday.\u00a0 \u201cI think everybody would know that that would be dangerous and counter-productive.\u201d The US Food and Drug Administration regularly warns the public against drinking bleach, or even inhaling fumes from bleach. It's also irritating to skin. On Monday,\u00a0the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said calls about poisonings with cleaners and disinfectants had increased more than 20% in the first three months of 2020 -- as coronavirus cleaning increased -- than from the same period a year earlier. Among cleaners, bleaches accounted for the largest percentage increase in calls from 2019 to 2020. The CDC recommends using soap and water or bleach on surfaces to kill the virus. Rubbing alcohol that's at least 70% alcohol will also kill it on surfaces; 60% for your hands. Roll up for Donald Trump's old West traveling medicine show. He's marketed steaks and real estate, board games and vodka, but nothing the incorrigible salesman has tried to hawk measures up to his latest routine as\u00a0he speculated on a possible new cure\u00a0for Covid-19. For most of his life as a pitchman, Trump has only had his own reputation on the line. But now, in the middle of a generational health crisis, lives are at stake. In an eye-popping moment, Trump doubled down on his claim that sunlight and the festering humidity of high summer could purge the virus in his latest grab for a game-changer therapy. Then, he asked aides on camera whether zapping patients with light or injecting disinfectant into the lungs to clean sick patients from inside could cure them of the disease. \"Maybe you can, maybe you can't. Again I say maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor. I'm like a person who has a good you-know-what,\" Trump said, pointing to his head. It's easy to mock Trump. But he also has the world's largest megaphone, appears to be openly mulling a treatment that could cause people to poison themselves if they adopted it and has a record of deflecting from the grave reality of the virus to peddle optimism that may not be matched by the facts. He also seems to have little time for the rigorous clinical testing and factual deduction that is at the heart of generations of advances in clinical science and is the bedrock of ethical medicine. Read the full analysis here: Trump, ever the salesman, is peddling dangerous cures for coronavirus Dr. Anthony Fauci\u00a0said Thursday that he was doubtful of the country's\u00a0current testing capability, which is a key resource as several states and cities look to partially reopen their economies during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. During a\u00a0Time 100 Talks\u00a0interview, Fauci \u2014 the nation's top infectious disease expert and a White House coronavirus task force member \u2014 was asked how confident he was that the country currently has sufficient capability to handle the potential increased coronavirus testing needs in order to inform leaders looking to reopen hard-hit areas. \"We absolutely need to significantly ramp up, not only the number of tests but the capacity to actually perform them,\" Fauci said. That way, he continued, \"you don't have a situation where you have a test, but it can't be done because there's not a swab, or not an extraction media or not the right vial -- all of those things got to be in place.\" \"I am not overly confident right now at all, that we have what it takes to do that,\" Fauci added. Some context: Fauci's comments run counter to President Donald Trump's regular assurances that American coronavirus testing is on solid footing, including on Wednesday when he told reporters \"we're doing more testing, I think, than probably any of the governors want.\"  Trump and his political allies have touted the total number of coronavirus tests conducted in the US but the country still lags behind Italy in per capita tests performed. Rep. Anna Eshoo, the chairwoman of the House\u2019s Health subcommittee, told CNN she plans to call in Dr. Rick Bright to testify before her panel as she reviews the circumstances of his removal from a key position after he raised concerns about the safety of a drug that President Trump touted as a potential vaccine to coronavirus. \u201cI think the American people deserve to hear Dr Bright\u2019s story,\u201d Eshoo told CNN. \u201cHe really has worked for the American people \u2014 they are the ones who have paid his salary. A thoroughbred professional \u2014 and to set him aside in one of the most key positions to develop vaccines in the midst of the pandemic? The story doesn\u2019t make sense to me. So I think it deserves examination.\u201d Eshoo said she also wants to call Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Bob Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response, to testify before her panel. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this began, why, who where, when, why,\u201d\u00a0said Eshoo, whose subcommittee falls under the Energy and Commerce full committee. \u201cBut I think it deserves to be examined and the story told.\u201d Eshoo said she wants to have hearings as soon as it\u2019s \u201cfeasible\u201d and said she\u2019s willing to return to Washington to probe the matter. \u201cI\u2019m willing to come here, I think others will as well,\u201d she said Thursday. Eshoo appears to have backing from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Asked by CNN about the Bright situation, Pelosi directed an inquiry to Eshoo. Some context: Bright had led BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, since 2016 until Tuesday, when he was reassigned to a narrower position.  \"I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,\"\u00a0Bright said in a lengthy statement issued Wednesday. \"I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science \u2014 not politics or cronyism \u2014 has to lead the way.\""], "Language": false}
