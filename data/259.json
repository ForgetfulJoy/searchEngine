President Trump has signed an executive order that mandates meat processing plants must stay open, an official said. Aides said the order would fall under the Defense Production Act. Trump had highlighted the order during an Oval Office meeting with\u00a0Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0that was opened up to reporters. \"We're going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that'll solve any liability problems,\" Trump said on Tuesday. The President signed the order after some companies,\u00a0such as Tyson Foods, were considering only keeping 20% of their facilities open. The vast majority of processing plants could have shut down \u2014 which would have reduced processing capacity in the country by as much as 80%, an official familiar with the order told CNN. By signing the order, Trump has declared these plants as a part of critical infrastructure in the US. The administration is also working with the Department of Labor on issuing guidance about which employees who work at these meat processing facilities should remain home, including workers who are part of populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus. Canada\u00a0released a new epidemic snapshot Tuesday and updated modeling that shows\u00a0its epidemic growth rate is slower than in most countries, including the United States, but also shows a death rate higher than earlier predicted. Canadian public health officials say the epidemic growth is slowing. About a month ago it was doubling every three days but is now doubling every 16 days. However,\u00a0Canada\u00a0is now reporting nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, much higher than originally predicted. \u201cWe are seeing the tragic paradox of the epidemic playing out,\u201d said Dr. Theresa Tam,\u00a0Canada\u2019s chief public health officer during a presentation of the new modeling Tuesday. \u201cAs the epidemic comes under control, and the growth of cases slows, the severe outcomes and deaths continue to accrue, as Covid-19 takes a heavy toll among highly susceptible populations,\u201d Tam said.\u00a0 Canada\u00a0is currently dealing with hundreds of outbreaks in long-term care homes throughout the country. Government statistics released Tuesday show that 79% of deaths across the country are related to outbreaks in care centers. \u201cOutbreaks in long-term care and seniors\u2019 homes are driving epidemic growth in Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia and are responsible for the majority of all deaths in\u00a0Canada,\u201d Tam said.\u00a0 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that while\u00a0Canada\u00a0was flattening the curve, distancing measures and some closures would remain in place for some time.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of the most serious public health emergency\u00a0Canada\u00a0has ever seen and if we lift measures too quickly, we might lose the progress we\u2019ve made,\u201d Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Tuesday. \u00a0 Monaco will begin to relax some coronavirus confinement measures starting on Monday. However, its famous gambling halls and beaches will remain closed until June, the government confirmed today.\u00a0 In a statement, the government praised the collective efforts of its citizens, but cautioned that the relaxation of confinement measures will come with \u201c10 essential conditions\u201d to be met.\u00a0 As part of the first phase of Monaco\u2019s re-opening \u2014 which is beginning Monday, May 4 \u2014 shops (except for cafes and restaurants) and beauty salons will be permitted to open. However, gatherings of more than five people will be prohibited, and working from home will continue to be recommended.\u00a0 As part of the second phase of Monaco\u2019s re-opening will begin on May 11. There will be a gradual reopening of schools, with emphasis on core curriculums.\u00a0 In June, if health conditions permit, the opening of caf\u00e9s, restaurants, gambling halls, beaches, museums, and other leisure places may be considered by the government.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## There are at least\u00a01,002,498\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases.

British Airways has announced a restructuring and redundancy plan that could lead to thousands of permanent layoffs.  The airline says it is formally notifying its trade unions about the plan, which \u201cwill affect most of British Airways\u2019 employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them.\u201d  British Airways had already placed 22,626 employees on temporary furlough in April as part of the UK government\u2019s retention scheme. The announcement came as BA\u2019s parent company IAG announced first quarter results. IAG, which also owns Iberia, saw total revenue fall 13% in the first quarter.  The airline warned that losses in the second quarter would be \u201csignificantly worse\u201d because of coronavirus. It also said that it expects that \u201cthe recovery of passenger demand to 2019 levels will take several years.\u201d\u00a0 Greece will start to gradually ease lockdown restrictions starting Monday, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced in a televised speech Tuesday.\u00a0 Starting Monday, the restrictions on the movement of citizens will be lifted, Mitsotakis said. However, citizens will still not be allowed to commute outside their county of residence for at least two weeks. Some businesses \u2014 such as bookstores, electronic and sporting goods stores, as well as hair salons \u2014 will be allowed to reopen on Monday. Other retail stores can resume business on May 11, except for shopping malls which will open on June 1, according to the prime minister.  There will be certain restrictions that will limit the amount of customers, Mitsotakis added, including that other strict measures will be taken to protect workers. Bars and restaurants are set to reopen on June 1 but under new rules. Mitsotakis also announced that schools will gradually reopen on May 11, but only for students on the last year of high school. The rest of high school and junior high classes will follow a week after.

In a teleconference with regional governors Tuesday, Putin said Russia has managed to ramp up production of protective gear but added, \u201ccompared to what [production] was before, it\u2019s a lot. But compared to what we need now, it\u2019s still not enough.\u201d The president has faced criticism in Russia for sending ventilators and protective equipment to the US and Italy while the virus spread. In his remarks Tuesday, Putin said Russian authorities had \u201cput the brakes on\u201d the spread of coronavirus.  However, Russia has surpassed both Iran and China in the number of confirmed cases. ##Health## Italy has confirmed 200,000 cases of Covid-19, including deaths and recoveries, according to the Italian Civil Protection Agency.

The beginning of May in Russia is marked by long public holidays for Labor Day and Victory Day, with a few working days in between that will be made non-working days this year, Putin added. After May 11, the country might start to gradually ease restrictions, Putin said. He ordered the government to prepare a plan for that by May 5. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about it as a simultaneous cancellation of restrictions, we must prepare for a tough road ahead,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWe need to account for all risks and show sensibility, so we are not thrown back to lose everything we have so far achieved.\"\u00a0 In his address, Putin acknowledged \u201cdeficit of some items,\u201d including medical equipment, and ordered his government to increase production rates. Professional sports will not continue the 2019-2020 season due to the coronavirus pandemic, French Prime Minister\u00a0Edouard\u00a0Philippe said on Tuesday. \"The 2019-2020 season of professional sports, especially football, will not be able to resume,\" Philippe told the French National Assembly. ##Daily Life## France will begin to ease lockdown restrictions on May 11, after the country's prime minister said they will have enough masks to meet the need. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Tuesday: \u201cWe are proposing a very gradual reopening of kindergartens and elementary schools from May 11, everywhere on the territory and on a voluntary basis. In a second step, we can consider reopening the colleges (intermediary schools), starting with 6th and 7th grade (11-12 year-olds). We will make a decision in early June for high schools.\u201d After an initial easing of lockdown measures on May 11, there will be a second monitoring phase from May 11\u00a0to\u00a0June 2, Philippe added. France will make a decision on the opening of bars, cafes and restaurants at the end of May. The prime minister said there are three strategies to fight the crisis: Protect, test and isolate. \u201cWe have to progress with prudence,\" Philippe said. \u201cConfinement was an efficient instrument,\u201d adding that confinement \"prevented 62,000 deaths\" in the country.  ##Daily Life## Portugal will end its current state of emergency on Saturday, the country\u2019s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa announced on Tuesday. \u201cIt is expected that it won\u2019t be necessary in the future to again resort to the state of emergency \u2013 if it is, it will be weighted,\" Rebelo de Sousa told journalists during a press conference on Tuesday.  \u201cThe Portuguese need to be aware that containment is still important, that controlling the situation is still important and that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking small steps and evaluating them constantly as well,\u201d he added. ##Daily Life## Scotland's government is recommending that people wear face coverings in situations where maintaining social distancing is difficult, such as on public transportation or inside food shops, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday.\u00a0 Speaking\u00a0at the daily coronavirus briefing, Sturgeon acknowledged\u00a0that evidence on the benefits of face coverings was not \"overwhelming,\" but said there\u00a0may be \"some benefit\" to wearing them in enclosed spaces.\u00a0 The Scottish government said this in a statement: \"The evidence on the use of face coverings is limited, but there may be some benefit in wearing a facial covering when you leave the house and enter enclosed spaces, especially where physical distancing is more difficult and where there is a risk of close contact with multiple people you do not usually meet. Examples include, traveling on public transport or entering a food shop where it is not always possible to maintain a 2 meter distance from another customer. There is no evidence to suggest there might be a benefit outdoors, unless in an unavoidable crowded situation, where there may be some benefit.\" Sturgeon added that wearing a face covering does not mean that other social distancing rules don't apply, and cautioned against people feeling \"invincible\" because they are wearing a mask.\u00a0 ##Health## ##Daily Life## More than 125,000 birthday cards have been sent to 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore, the British war veteran who walked 100 laps of his garden to raise money for the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS).

At the Bedford School, attended by Captain Moore\u2019s grandson Benjie Ingram-Moore, volunteers have been opening the \u201cphenomenal\u201d number of birthday cards being sent to honor his birthday. \u201cThe volume of cards that have been sent to grandad is just astonishing,\u201d Benjie Ingram-Moore said, who has been managing the social media for his grandfather\u2019s fundraising effort. \u201cSo many of the cards are truly heartfelt with thousands from young children who have taken the time to use their artistic talent and write a personal message.\u201d ##Daily Life## The novel coronavirus has now infected more than 3 million people and killed at least 211,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments: One billion infections predicted: The International Rescue Committee (IRC) estimates that there could be up to one billion coronavirus infections and 3.2 million deaths in crisis-affected countries unless swift action is taken to curb its spread.\u00a0\nUS deaths forecast: Dr. Chris Murray, director of the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Help Metrics and Evaluation, said the institute's scientific model had increased its predicted US coronavirus death toll from 60,000 to 74,000. More than\u00a056,000 people have died in the US, more than a quarter of deaths worldwide. \nStates are reopening: Texas is partially reopening from Friday, and New York's first phase of reopening could begin after May 15 in some areas.

The kits were ruled faulty after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducted field tests with them.\u00a0 \u201cBased on scientific assessment of their performance, the order in question (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech) along with an order in respect of another make (Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics) found under-performing have been canceled. It needs to be stressed that ICMR has not made any payment whatsoever in respect of these supplies,\u201d said the release from India\u2019s Health Ministry. Ji Rong, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in India, said in a statement:\u00a0\"We are deeply concerned with the evaluation results and the decision made by Indian Council of Medical Research. China attaches great importance to the quality of exported medical products.\" The statement added that both Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics had issued statements on the matter, stressing their test kits had obtained their certification from the National Medical Products Administration of China and meet international quality standards and have been exported to countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The statement said there were \"strict requirements for the storage, transportation and use of Covid-19 antibody rapid test kits\" and that any operation \"not carried out by professionals in accordance with the product specifications will lead to the testing accuracy variations.\" In a news conference on Monday, a senior health ministry official said that India continues to have sufficient kits in place. ##Health## Six-time\u00a0Formula 1\u00a0world champion Lewis Hamilton says that the lack of racing this season has left him feeling a \"big void.\"\u00a0 The French Grand Prix -- originally scheduled for the end of June --\u00a0became\u00a0the 10th race of the 2020 season to be affected by\u00a0Covid-19, after organizers confirmed it would not go ahead. \"I miss racing every day. This is the first time since I was 8 that I haven't started a season,\" the 35-year-old\u00a0said\u00a0on social media.\u00a0\"When you live and breathe something you love, when it's gone there's definitely a big void.

New Zealand instituted the measure despite the World Health Organization advising against travel bans. \u201cI think the WHO\u2019s position is that it doesn\u2019t endorse or advocate travel bans,\u201d Clark told BBC radio. \u201cAnd that\u2019s got quite a lot to do with the murky geopolitical realm within which it operates. And also because it fears that if it were to support it, it might not get full cooperation from countries. \u201cBut I have no hesitation in saying that New Zealand, banning travel from China at the very beginning of February and later from Iran, and then in March moving to stricter and stricter controls with only New Zealand citizens\u2026 coming in \u2013 this worked for us. \u201cAnd I think New Zealanders will be pretty hesitant to see people just flying back in again.\u201d Over the past few days, newly diagnosed infections have been in the single digits. And on Monday, New Zealand reported just one new case. Clark was Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1999 to 2008. She later headed the UN\u2019s Development Programme for eight years. ##Travel## Spain lost thousands of jobs in the first\u00a0quarter\u00a0of the year,\u00a0most of them in March, when rapidly increasing coronavirus infections prompted the government to declare a nationwide state of emergency and lockdown on March 14 that brought most businesses to an abrupt standstill. The country\u2019s active\u00a0workforce\u00a0shrank by 285,600 people in the first quarter,\u00a0Spain\u2019s National Statistics Institute\u00a0reported on\u00a0Tuesday.\u00a0The unemployment rate rose to 14.4%, up from 13.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The number of newly jobless was listed at just 121,000. But the Statistics Institute said \"inactive\" workers increased by 257,000 in the first quarter and \"it's probable that many workers who lost their jobs were listed as 'inactive'\" rather than unemployed. The government-imposed lockdown affected only the final two weeks of the quarter, and the lockdown has been extended until May 9, suggesting job losses could increase further when data for the second quarter is released this summer. The Statistics Institute said the jobless figures also don't show workers who are on a \"temporary\" layoff of up to three months on a government-backed benefit program, collecting up to 80% of their salaries. The Socialist government has said repeatedly that it wants to avoid the mistakes of the 2008 financial crisis, which hit Spain hard. It has ordered that companies cannot use coronavirus as an excuse to fire workers.  But it's unclear when Spain's tourism sector, accounting for 12.3% of GDP and 12.7% of employment according to the Statistics Institute, will be able to re-open for business. ##Daily Life## ##Business## Black barbers across America are engaging in a heated debate over whether cities and states should lift coronavirus social distancing mandates that have forced many of their businesses to close indefinitely. African Americans as a group are\u00a0suffering the most\u00a0during the Covid-19 pandemic, with\u00a0higher infection and mortality rates\u00a0than the general population. Barbers say black business owners, like many of them, are also disproportionately hurting financially from government shutdowns meant to stem the virus' spread. Several shop owners said they can't afford to remain closed much longer.\u00a0 In African-American culture, barbershops are much more than places to get a haircut. Many are marketplaces where local vendors sell their wares and community centers where people gather for hours to discuss\u00a0politics,\u00a0sports\u00a0and the news of the day. The unique folkways and stature of black barbershops have been the subject of\u00a0iconic movie scenes,\u00a0Hollywood film franchises, even an\u00a0HBO television series. \"There's probably all kinds of barbershops talking about what's going on with our government right now,\" Mike Knuckles, 45, a barber at Select Cutz in Grand Prairie, Texas, told CNN Business. \"If you lose a barbershop that's been in the community 30 years and has a tradition and respect in the community, that's huge.\" Damon Dorsey, 59, president of the American Barber Association, a barber advocacy group whose estimated membership of 3,000 is about 30% black, said he has spent weeks talking with worried barbers nationwide since the pandemic began. They're concerned about limiting the spread of Covid-19, but also want to \"get back to making money,\" Dorsey told CNN Business. \"All are struggling with the uncertainty of the moment,\" he said.

It is also suspending plans to lay off tens of thousands of staff. The London-based lender on Tuesday said that pre-tax profit dropped to $3.2 billion in the first quarter, a 48% plunge compared to a year earlier. The bank added that it increased its allowance for expected credit losses this year to as much as $11 billion \u2014 nearly $2 billion more than it had set aside at the end of last year. It said expected credit losses rose to $3 billion last quarter in part due to coronavirus.\u00a0 It also attributed its recent woes to the ongoing\u00a0plunge in oil prices.\u00a0 \"The outlook for world economies in 2020 has substantially worsened in the past two months,\" the company said in a statement. The coronavirus outbreak first hit Asia, where HSBC derives the vast majority of its earnings. The lender has in previous quarters made\u00a0almost 90%\u00a0of its profit in the region. Performance there was actually \"resilient\" compared to expectations, the bank noted. Profit in Asia fell about 25% in the first quarter, compared to steep losses in North America and Europe. HSBC also said it is now hitting pause on parts of its\u00a0vast restructuring plan, which had included a decision to cut 35,000 jobs and dramatically overhaul its business, to reduce uncertainty for employees. The bank is also delaying part of its plan to shed $100 billion in assets, which is expected to help reduce restructuring costs for this year.

The institute said the survey was conducted between April 10-14 from an\u00a0ongoing online panel consisting of a representative sample of the UK population. ##Daily Life## ##Business## The International Rescue Committee (IRC) estimates that there could be up to one billion coronavirus infections in crisis-affected countries unless swift action is taken to curb its spread.\u00a0 In a worst-case scenario, it warns that could result in up to 3.2 million deaths. \u201cThese numbers should serve as a wake-up call: the full, devastating and disproportionate weight of this pandemic has yet to be felt in the world\u2019s most fragile and war-torn countries,\u201d said  David Miliband, the President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. \u201cWe are still in the critical window of time to mount a robust preventative response to the early stages of Covid-19 in many of these countries and prevent a further perpetuation of this epidemic globally.\u201d\u00a0 In a statement, the IRC said it had compiled the estimates based on modeling and data produced by Imperial College London and the World Health Organisation. The Imperial College London report referenced by the IRC modeled mortality rates under different suppression policies. It considered variables such as a country\u2019s economy, population demographics, and estimated health care capacity. The 34 crisis-affected countries the IRC refers to are: Afghanistan, Burundi, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cameroon, CAR, Chad, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, DRC, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Greece, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Venezuela and Yemen. \u00a0##Health## Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori says if the pandemic is not over by next summer, the Games will be canceled, according to an interview published Tuesday in Nikkan Sports. It is the strongest statement so far on the possibility of canceling the Games from the organization, which has routinely said it was focusing on plans to hold the Olympics next year as the outbreak of Covid-19 grew into a pandemic. The Olympic and Paralympic Games originally planned for this summer in Tokyo were rescheduled to start from July 23, 2021. Nikkan Sports quoted Mori responding to a question about another postponement of the games if the pandemic was not over by next summer:\u00a0 \"No. It will be cancelled then. The Olympics was cancelled in the past for the problems like war. We are fighting against invisible enemy now.  Mori reiterated Tokyo 2020 was still working towards holding the Games and that they would be more significant than others.\u00a0\u201cThe Olympics would be much more valuable than any Olympics in the past if we could go ahead with it after winning this battle,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cWe have to believe this otherwise our hard work and efforts will not be rewarded. Tokyo 2020 spokesperson Masa Takaya's told media Tuesday that Mori\u2019s comments \u201cwere his own thoughts.\u201d When questioned about Mori\u2019s remarks, the Tokyo 2020 public relations office responded to CNN in a statement saying, \u201cthere are variety of insights opinions around the possibility of hosting games next year.\u201d \u201cThe mission of the organizing committee is to prepare for the stage for the Games next year.\u00a0We understand there are variety of opinions, however, there are some experts who say it's too early to make a judgment whether to be able to hold the Games,\u201d the statement added. This post has been updated to include Tokyo 2020's response to CNN. ##Business## ##Daily Life## Hoping to get a better idea of how many people have previously been infected with the virus, officials in the US have begun asking asymptomatic residents to test for antibodies. Los Angeles County will expand coronavirus testing Tuesday to include delivery drivers, rideshare drivers, and taxi drivers even if they're asymptomatic, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. \"These are folks that are on the frontlines, helping us get to where we need to go, helping us have food delivered to our homes,\" he said.

Anschober\u00a0added that gatherings of up to 10 people would be allowed immediately under the condition that the public respect social distancing rules. However, the health minister warned it was premature to believe the crisis was over and said the restrictions can be reinstated at any point.  Here's a breakdown: From May 1, people will only need to keep a minimum distance of 1 meter from others who do not live in the same household. \nAll shops and many service providers such as hairdressers will be allowed to reopen at the beginning of May.\nFrom May 15, restaurants and bars are allowed to reopen, providing social distancing measures are in place. Restaurant staff who have direct contact with guests are required to wear masks.\nHotels will be allowed to reopen from May 29 The number of new coronavirus cases has been in the double-digit range for days and, \"That was a very big goal,\" Anschober said.

By Tuesday midday local time, 2.44 million people had downloaded the app, exceeding expectations, Australian health minister Greg Hunt said at a televised news conference.  \"Australians have embraced their part in actions to prevent the spread of coronavirus,\u201d he said. The app, which uses Bluetooth signals to track when people are close to another app user, has raised privacy concerns.

Health authorities said the app does not collect data on a user's location.  \u201cThe COVIDSafe App does not have any geolocation capability, it does not track your location, only the proximity of your phone to other people\u2019s phones that have downloaded the app, and cannot monitor a person\u2019s location at any time,\" a department of health spokesperson told 7 News.   On Tuesday, Hunt said that it would not be physically or legally possible for any other authorities or nations, such as the US, to access the app's data.  \u201cWe have locked this down so completely, so thoroughly with the biosecurity rule, with legislation that is coming, the only people who can access the data are the state and territory health officials,\u201d chief medical officer Brendan Murphy told 7 News.

On average, one person infected with Covid-19 is now infecting one other person,  according to the country's center for disease control and prevention, the Robert Koch Institute. That\u2019s up from a reproduction rate of 0.9 a week ago and 0.7 the week before.  Merkel has previously warned that if the number -- also known as the R0 value -- rises above 1, the country\u2019s health system would eventually be overwhelmed. She has also said that Germany risks squandering the gains made so far if it loosens physical distancing restrictions too quickly.\u00a0 Despite the rise in the reproduction number, new infections remain at a relatively moderate level.

A perfect storm for disease: \"Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a 'perfect storm' for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people,\" the scientists said,  \"This often occurs in areas where communities live that are most vulnerable to infectious diseases.\"  The authors warn that this is just the beginning: About 1.7 million unidentified viruses of the type known to infect people are believed to still exist in mammals and water birds.  What they recommend: Strengthen and enforce environmental regulations -- \"and only deploy stimulus packages that offer incentives for more sustainable and nature-positive activities.\"\nAdopt a 'One Health' approach to decision-making -- \"recognizing the complex interconnections among the health of people, animals, plants and our shared environment.\"\nHealth systems need to be properly funded in countries with disease hot spot risks.

Trump celebrated saving more than a million lives with his \"good decisions\" and boasted that \"there's a hunger for reopening\" the nation and it's \"happening faster than people would think,\" while leaving a misleading impression that the virus is all but defeated in the nation's great cities. \"We are deploying the full power of the federal government,\" Trump said even as he unrolled a plan\u00a0complete with a glossy power point presentation\u00a0that falls well short of the level of testing -- several million a day -- that some experts say is needed to keep the pathogen at bay.

People can also swim and surf at nearby Bronte beach and surf only at Tamarama and Mackenzies Bay. ##Daily Life## Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, says current technology makes it impossible to test every American for coronavirus. The United States, she says, will need a\u00a0\"breakthrough\"\u00a0in testing to screen large numbers of people. According to Birx, that breakthrough is antigen testing.  What antigen tests do: Often used to check for the flu and strep, antigen tests look for pieces of a virus -- often the proteins that cover its surface. How that differs from most coronavirus tests: These look for the virus' genetic material and require a number of chemicals to run, many of which are in short supply. The tests can also take hours to run. A quicker solution? Antigen tests are simpler -- and potentially less reliable -- but they can provide results in as little as 15 minutes, according to the US\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why doesn't the US already have multiple tests? For starters, the tests are not easy to make, and validating their accuracy can be time-consuming and expensive. For another, there hasn't been a big market for them before now. WHO cautions against them: While some companies claim to have developed rapid antigen tests, the World Health Organization is\u00a0cautioning\u00a0against their use -- at least for now, until more is known.

Ardern said Alert Level 3 represents the move toward getting the country and its economy up and running again.\u00a0 \u00a0\"We must continue to stay home where possible, including for work and education ... Please stay regional and limit non-essential travel,\" she said.  Ardern warned that the country must stay vigilant to protect the progress made so far. \"If you're sick, stay home and contact your GP or health line and get tested,\" she said.\u00a0 What Level 3 means: New Zealand is still essentially under lockdown, but restrictions have eased. Schools can open. People can buy takeaway food, and take part in more recreational activities, such as swimming at the beach. Up to 10 people can gather for weddings and funerals.\u00a0 Alert level 3 does not permit more social activity, but allows more economic activity. Ardern said: Business restarting at Level 3 will see around 400,000 more New Zealanders back at work.\nThat means about 1 million in total working.\u00a0\nAt Level 3, around 75% of the economy is operating, with key sectors like building and construction, forestry, manufacturing and contactless retail restarting.\u00a0\nMajor infrastructure projects also start up again today. Over 1,000 roads and rail construction workers are back on major projects. ##Business## ##Daily Life## The US state of Missouri\u2019s restrictions on businesses will be lifted on May 4, following a new plan put in place by Gov.

In a news conference Monday, the governor said the state will be ready to begin reopening the economy next week.\u00a0 \u201cOur plan is working, the healthcare system is not overwhelmed and we are winning the battle,\u201d Gov. Parson said. Under the new plan, any business will be able to reopen as long as 6 feet of social distancing can be maintained.\u00a0Indoor retail businesses will also have to limit their number of customers to no more than 25% of normal capacity.\u00a0Local communities will be allowed to have stricter rules if they choose. The governor\u2019s order does not distinguish between essential and non-essential work. \u201cAll of Missouri\u2019s businesses, employers, and employees are vital to our state\u2019s economy and well-being,\u201d Gov.

Garcetti said: Both the city and county saw an increase in cases of about 5% since Sunday.\nLast Monday, the county reported a 12% increase of cases.\u00a0 Garcetti noted that it\u2019s important to look at how many tests come in positive versus negative. About 8% of all tests from the city and county\u2019s testing sites come back positive and about 15% overall, including tests from providers and hospitals, he said.  Los Angeles County reported at least 20,417 new cases and 942 deaths today. Lifting restrictions a gradual process: The stay-at-home order in Los Angeles County runs through May 15, but not every restriction will be lifted on that day, Garcetti said. Expanded testing: Starting Tuesday, Los Angeles County will expand its coronavirus testing to include delivery drivers, rideshare drivers, and taxi drivers even if they\u2019re asymptomatic.

November 3. Good number,\u201d Trump told reporters at a news briefing when asked whether he has considered such a move.\u00a0 Trump added that Biden never said he would try to delay the election -- despite Biden saying those words exactly during a virtual fundraiser last week, according to a pool report. \"Mark my words: I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held,\" Biden said on the call. Trump\u00a0cannot unilaterally change the date of the election\u00a0in November, as it has been set\u00a0into law by federal statute and Congress would have to approve such a move.\u00a0 However, that has not stopped some Democrats from worrying that he will try to do so, and voters asked the previously large field of Democratic presidential candidates if they had concerns that Trump would try to delay the election or refuse to leave office if he were defeated in November.
