The Senate had earlier Wednesday approved the House-passed bill. The move allowed the upper chamber to devote its full attention to passing the next relief package in response to the coronavirus crisis. According to the White House, the \"Families First Coronavirus Response Act\" will provide \"supplemental appropriations related to the COVID-19 public health emergency, as well as waivers and modifications of Federal nutrition programs, employment-related protections and benefits, health programs and insurance coverage requirements, and related tax credits during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\" ##Health## Australian airline Qantas and its subsidiary Jetstar will suspend scheduled international flights from late March until at least the end of May due to the coronavirus crisis.  In a statement posted on its website Thursday, Qantas Group announced that 60% of its domestic flights would also be cut, and two-thirds of its 30,000 employees would be temporarily stood down. There's the possibility of ad-hoc international flights, the group said in its statement. Here's the group's statement: Earlier this week, cuts to 90 per cent of international flying and about 60 per cent of domestic flying were\u00a0announced by Qantas and Jetstar. With the Federal Government now recommending against all overseas travel from Australia, regularly scheduled international flights will continue until late March to assist with repatriation and will then be suspended until at least the end of May 2020. As the national carrier, Qantas is in ongoing discussions with the Federal Government about continuation of some strategic links.\nMore than 150 aircraft will be temporarily grounded, including all of Qantas\u2019 A380s, 747s and B787-9s and Jetstar\u2019s B787-8s.\u00a0Discussions are progressing with airports and government about parking for these aircraft.\nEssential domestic, regional and freight connections will be maintained as much as possible.

FDA\u00a0guidance issued\u00a0earlier this week\u00a0allows companies to\u00a0manufacture\u00a0and ship tests before receiving permission. Yet the authorizations still offer a stamp of approval to tests, signaling that federal regulators are satisfied with their validation data and believe their benefits outweigh any risks, such as false positives or negatives. Four\u00a0other\u00a0tests were authorized by the FDA this week; Abbott\u2019s test is the fifth, for a total of nine. \u00a0Unlike tests that give results at home or in a doctor\u2019s office, coronavirus tests must be run on specialized equipment in clinical labs. The Abbott\u00a0system\u00a0can process up to 470 tests per day, according to the company, whose test was authorized Tuesday. The Swiss firm Roche, whose test was greenlit last week, says its systems can process up to 960 results in eight hours.\u00a0 Such \u201chigh-throughput\u201d systems have the potential to dramatically increase testing capacity in the United States. But shortages of the people and tools needed to run the tests \u2013 like health care workers and cotton swabs \u2013 could still slow testing. ##Health##\u00a0 A researcher at University of Washington Medicine has died of coronavirus, according to a tweet from the medical school. Dr. Stephen Schwartz was a professor of pathology since 1984, according to the department\u2019s biography, with a focus on vascular biology. \u00a0\u201cHe has left a lasting imprint on our department, our university, and the broader scientific community and will be greatly missed,\u201d the University of Washington Medicine's Department of Pathology tweeted.\u00a0 Schwartz co-authored dozens of studies on cardiovascular and cancer-related issues, according to a collection of research papers maintained by the National Institutes of Health.\u00a0He earned his PhD from the University of Washington in 1973. ##Health##\u00a0 There are at least\u00a08,525\u00a0cases of novel coronavirus in the United States, according to the state and local health agencies, governments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0 According to the CDC, there are\u00a070\u00a0cases from repatriated citizens.

In total,\u00a0145\u00a0people have died.\u00a0 Watch: ##Health## The US Food and Drug Administration will temporarily postpone all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn announced Wednesday. It made the move for the health of its staff, state inspectors \u201cand because of industry concerns about visitors,\" he said. The agency handles facility inspections for all\u00a0FDA-regulated products, such as food, animal feed, drugs, biological products, devices and tobacco. \u201cAll domestic for-cause inspection assignments will be evaluated and will proceed if mission-critical. We will continue to respond to natural disasters, outbreaks and other public health emergencies involving\u00a0FDA-regulated products,\u201d Hahn said.  But the\u00a0FDA\u00a0will be looking at other ways to complete inspections, such as \u201cevaluating records in lieu of conducting an onsite inspection on an interim basis when travel is not permissible, when appropriate,\" he said. The\u00a0FDA\u00a0had previously postponed most foreign facility inspections through April.\u00a0 Hahn stated that the\u00a0FDA\u00a0\u201cwill continue to assess and calibrate our approach as needed and we stand ready to resume any postponed inspections as soon as feasible.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Hahn also said the\u00a0FDA directed all eligible employees to begin teleworking this week. ##Daily Life## California Gov.

Based on this information, and the judgment that all of our players are subject to high exposure due to the close physical nature of basketball, the communal nature of teams and the possibility of an accelerated spread from team to team, our medical experts advised that our players get tested,\" the team said in a statement.\u00a0 The team also added that they \"sourced the tests through a private company and paid for them ourselves because we did not want to impact access to CDC\u2019s public resources. Using the test results, we were able to take immediate precautions and strictly isolate the players who tested positive.\" The Nets announced on Tuesday that four players had tested positive for COVID-19, most notably superstar Kevin Durant.\u00a0 So far seven NBA players have tested positive for coronavirus.\u00a0 ##Health## Air Canada announced Wednesday that it will gradually suspend the majority of its international and US trans-border flights by March 31.

Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Florida, has become the first member of Congress to test positive for coronavirus.  He tweeted that he is feeling better. \"However, it's important that everyone take this seriously and follow\u00a0@CDCgov\u00a0guidelines in order to avoid getting sick & mitigate the spread of this virus,\" Diaz-Balart said. \u00a0 ##Health## Mild, asymptomatic or otherwise unrecognized infections may have driven the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus in the outbreak\u2019s earliest days, according to modeling published Monday in the journal Science. The research, based on reported cases in China and travel data, estimated that 86% of coronavirus infections in the country were \u201cundocumented\u201d in the weeks before officials instituted stringent quarantines.\u00a0 Undocumented infections, according to the researchers, can go unrecognized because they come with mild or no symptoms, and that \u201ccan expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur.\u201d These undetected cases, which are often less severe, were estimated to be about half as contagious as confirmed cases. But because undetected cases were more common, they could have played an outsize role in spreading the virus, the study said. About 4 in 5 people confirmed to have coronavirus, for example, were likely infected by people who didn\u2019t know they had it, according to the modeling. \u201cThese findings explain the rapid geographic spread of [coronavirus] and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging,\u201d the researchers wrote. The study, they later added, suggests that \u201ca radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control [the virus].\u201d ##Health## Arizona Gov.

The document published by the Italian National Health Institute details that, on average, it takes four days from when patients show first symptoms until they are hospitalized and four more days until they die. The median average age of Italian deceased is 80.5 years old,\u00a0while the median average for those infected is 63, the report says. Women only make up 30% of the total dead and their median average age at the time of death is higher than men, at 83.6 years old.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The government also found that most people had two or three existing pathologies prior to being infected with the coronavirus. Among those, high blood pressure was the most common, followed by heart problems and diabetes. As for the most common complications developed because of the virus, respiratory failure was the leading one, happening in 97.2% of the cases. Liver and heart failure were the second and third most common complications. Watch: ##Health## Digestive symptoms may be more common in coronavirus infections than previously thought, with a\u00a0small study\u00a0released Wednesday finding that symptoms such as diarrhea and a loss of appetite were the \u201cchief complaint\u201d\u00a0in nearly half of more than 200 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The research suggests that, during the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians may need to look beyond the major Covid-19 symptoms identified by US\u00a0health officials:\u00a0fever, cough and shortness of breath. That\u2019s because many patients infected with coronavirus, according to the study, may initially present to the hospital with diarrhea, anorexia and vomiting \u2013 not necessarily with respiratory symptoms. Even when researchers excluded anorexia \u2013 a loss of appetite or aversion to food \u2013 they found that 1 in 5 coronavirus patients still came to the hospital with diarrhea, vomiting or abdominal pain. In more severe coronavirus cases, digestive symptoms also became more pronounced, and patients with digestive problems were less likely to be discharged, according to the study. The research, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, looked at\u00a0204\u00a0confirmed coronavirus cases in\u00a0Hubei province, China. A small number of those patients \u2013 seven people \u2013\u00a0had digestive problems, but no respiratory symptoms at all. While the researchers cautioned that larger studies would be needed to confirm their findings, they warned that \u201cif clinicians solely monitor for respiratory symptoms to establish case definitions for COVID-19, they may miss cases initially presenting with extra-pulmonary symptoms, or the disease may not be diagnosed later until respiratory symptoms emerge.\u201d That might explain why many health care workers in China were infected in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, the researchers said. \u201cAlthough this was related to improper protection of medical personnel early on,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit may also have resulted from failing to consider COVID-19 in the face of atypical extra-pulmonary symptoms, especially those with digestive symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak.\u201d ##Health##\u00a0 The US Senate is now voting on the House-passed coronavirus relief legislation that includes provisions for free testing for COVID-19 and paid emergency leave.\u00a0 Once the Senate approves the measure it will go to President Trump for his signature.

H2A seasonal workers make up about 250,000 of the farming workforce \u2013 with about 93% coming from Mexico.  With the closure of the US Embassy\u2019s, those visas are not being processed.

Asked if the Senate could pass a bill as early as Thursday \u2013 an ambitious time frame some GOP senators said they hoped to meet \u2013 Sen.

The President will sign it.\u00a0And then we\u2019ll turn our full attention to the next install,\u201d Cornyn said.\u00a0 Sen. John Thune, the Republican Whip, agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to accelerate everything, pull it together quickly.\u00a0But by the time you get into negotiations with the Democrats, it pushes it through the weekend,\u201d Thune said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0As you know around here, when there\u2019s a sense of urgency things can happen more quickly.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to say if he agreed it would last into next week.

The New York Stock Exchange has halted stock trading for 15 minutes after the S&P 500 fell 7% on Wednesday afternoon \u00a0##Business## President Trump wasn\u2019t able to say when asked Wednesday why many non-symptomatic professional athletes have had access to coronavirus testing while many sick Americans don\u2019t. \u201cYou'd have to ask them that question,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShould that happen?\u201d the reporter followed up\u00a0 Trump responded, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say so, but perhaps that\u2019s been the story of life.\u201d ##Health## The World Health Organization announced in a press briefing in Geneva on Wednesday that it has organized a study to examine various untested coronavirus treatments.\u00a0 \"WHO and its partners are therefore organizing a study in many countries in which some of these untested treatments are compared with each other,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during the briefing. \"This large, international study is designed to generate the robust data we need, to show which treatments are the most effective.\" Tedros added: \"We have called this study the SOLIDARITY trial. The SOLIDARITY trial provides simplified procedures to enable even hospitals that have been overloaded to participate. Many countries have already confirmed that they will join the SOLIDARITY trial \u2014 Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand \u2014 and I trust many more will join.\" ##Health## The Trump stock rally, which at its peak a month ago was robust and seemingly unending, has completely evaporated. The Dow briefly fell more than 1,500 points on Tuesday, bringing the index below 19,732 points. That was the Dow's closing level on January 19, 2017, the day before Trump took office. The S&P 500 is still above its Trump inauguration level, but it is moving closer to wiping out all of Trump's stock market gains as well. The index, which is the broadest measure of Wall Street, was down 6.3% in the early afternoon on Tuesday. Global equities have been hit hard by the worries about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, which has by now infected more than 7,000 people in the United States. Economists predict recessions for both individual countries and the world economy this year as the pandemic dealt both a supply and demand shock to commerce. That said, expectations for a sharp rebound for the economy and the stock market towards the second half of the year are high. ##Business## President Trump was pressed Wednesday by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on the ventilator shortage at the nation\u2019s hospitals. \u201cHospitals are still supposed to have ventilators too, and when we have thousands of ventilators, it sounds like a lot. But this is a very unforeseen thing, nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody saw numbers like this even with regard to testing, normally we wouldn\u2019t be doing testing and they decided to do it. Very, very hard to ramp up. Now we\u2019re getting highly sophisticated tests and it\u2019s going very well,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Asked why it took so long if the US knew it needed more ventilators, he said, \u201cWell we knew \u2013 it depends, it depends on how it goes, worst case, absolutely, best case, not at all. So we\u2019re going to have to see where it goes. But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators and they\u2019re complex. These are complex machines.\u201d  Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence how many ventilators the US has. \u201cWe have a specific number of ventilators in the stockpile. It\u2019s in excess of 10,000. And you just heard the announcement from the Department of Defense, they\u2019ll be adding several more thousand to that,\u201d he said, adding that that number doesn\u2019t count all of the ventilators that exist in the marketplace and in healthcare facilities around the country.\u00a0 Pence went on to praise the \u201ctremendous spirit\u201d among industry leaders who are \u201cready to step in and add to that volume. Hear what was said: ##Health## Italian Sport Minister Vincenzo Spadafora said Wednesday that if people will not stay at home, in compliance with the coronavirus emergency measures, the government will be forced to \"ban outdoor sports activities.\" \"I believe that in the next few hours it will be necessary to consider the possibility of a complete ban also on outdoor activities,\" Spadafora said.  He added that the general consensus was to stay at home but \"if people will not follow it, we will be forced to place an absolute ban,\" Spadafora said. Spadafora made the announcement on Italian State television RAI 1.\u00a0\u00a0 The \"Cure Italy\" (Cura Italia) decree passed this week by the government and \"suspended all tax obligations until 30 May for all sports federations and sports activities\" and \"suspended the rents of all those structures owned by the State and municipalities where sports activities are held,\" according to the decree.\u00a0 Spadafora also indicated that Seria A soccer league will possibly resume on May 3.\u00a0 \"This is what we hope for. We will evaluate whether with open or closed doors, this will depend on the situation,\" Spadafora said.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Daily Life## Police arrested renowned Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif and three prominent activists who sounded the alarm about the spread of novel coronavirus in Egypt\u2019s overcrowded prisons in a demonstration in Cairo on Wednesday. The four women held banners and red balloons outside the prime minister\u2019s office demanding authorities take serious action to secure prisoners. \u201cEgyptian prisons in usual circumstance are clusters for diseases. Cells are overcrowded and with poor ventilation. Sunlight doesn\u2019t reach most cells. Skin, respiratory and bone diseases are common in prisons due to humidity and lack of mobility,\u201d Mona Seif, whose brother and prominent Alaa Abdel Fattah is in prison, said in a Facebook live broadcasting the protest. \u201cIf these are the usual circumstances in prisons holding tens of thousands of activists, imagine what it would be like these days when the government is trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus,\u201d she added. Fifteen minutes into the broadcast, police grabbed the phone and interrupted the transmission. None of the women have been reachable since then. Lawyer Khaled Ali said the women, including Soueif's sister Laila and American University in Cairo professor Rabab Al-Mahdy, were in Qasr El-Nile Police station in central Cairo.\u00a0 The health and lives of thousands of prisoners in Egypt could be \u201cat severe risk,\u201d a group of United Nations independent experts concluded in a report last November. A number of prisoners, including Egypt\u2019s former president Mohammed Morsi, died in incarnation. Human Rights Watch recommended that Egypt, along with governments in other affected countries, release unfairly detained prisoners in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump says he sees the country on wartime footing and himself as a \"wartime president\" amid a raging coronavirus crisis. \"I do,\" Trump said when asked if he sees the country at war with the disease. \"I'm looking at it that way.\" \"I view it \u2014 in a sense as a wartime president,\" Trump said after announcing he was invoking the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law allowing the government to mandate production of equipment. \"I mean, that's what we're fighting. I mean, it's a very tough situation here,\" he went on. \"You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they've ever been. We had the best economy we've ever had. And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy, and, but we're doing it and we're doing it well.\" Trump praised the nation's citizens for their response. \"The American people have been incredible \u2014 for the most part,\" he said. President Trump was pressed Wednesday on why he is calling coronavirus the \u201cChinese Virus,\u201d amid instances of bigotry against Asian-Americans. He did not indicate that he will stop calling it that, and claimed that he is using the term because China tried to blame the virus on US soldiers. \u201cCause it comes from China. It\u2019s not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that\u2019s why. I want to be accurate,\u201d Trump said. Pressed again, he said, \u201cI have great love for all of the people from our country, but as you know China tried to say at one point\u2026 that it was caused by American soldiers. That can\u2019t happen, it\u2019s not gonna happen, not as long as I\u2019m president. It comes from China.\u201d See the exchange: President Trump said Wednesday he doesn\u2019t agree with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s comments to Republican senators that US unemployment could reach Great Depression levels of 20%. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that \u2013 that\u2019s an absolute total worst case scenario,\u201d he conceded. But, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near it.\u201d The World Health Organization is continuing to call on countries to isolate, test and treat suspected cases of novel coronavirus as the pandemic sweeps the world.\u00a0 \u201cWHO continues to recommend that isolating, testing and treating every suspected case, and tracing every contact, must be the backbone of the response in every country,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva on Wednesday. Tedros added: \u201cThis is the best hope of preventing widespread community transmission. Many countries are listening to our call and finding solutions to increase their ability to implement the full package of measures that have turned the tide in several countries.\u201d \u00a0##Health## Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Department of Defense will make available up to five million N95 masks and other personal protective equipment from US strategic reserves, he said, noting that \u201cthe first one million masks will be available immediately.\u201d\u00a0 He said they are also prepared to distribute \u201cup to 2,000 operational deployable ventilators for use as needed\u201d to the Department of Health and Human Services. Esper announced these steps on ventilators and masks on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0 He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve certified our 16th lab to help with processing tests from across the country.\u201d Yesterday, this number was 14.\u00a0 Esper said the USS Mercy and Comfort Navy hospital ships are being prepared to deploy. \u201cWe have also alerted a variety of field and expeditionary hospitals to be ready to deployed as needed, based on direction from the commander in chief,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US military remains ready and capable at defending the country and our interests abroad,\u201d Esper said. He said his department is \u201cleaning forward\u201d in its response, noting that the Department has issued international and domestic travel restrictions to all DOD personnel and families. ##Health## Gov. Attilio Fontana of Lombardy, Italy, made another appeal to the people: \"You must not go out, you have to stay at home.\" \"Unfortunately the numbers of the contagion are not decreasing, they continue to be high.\u00a0Soon we will not be able to give an answer to those who get sick,\" the governor said. Fontana then made a plea to Lombardy citizens. \"We are asking you to make a sacrifice in order to save lives. Every time you leave home it's s a risk for you and others,\" said Fontana, adding that if people continue not to comply with the restriction he will ask the government to implement \"even stricter measures,\" the governor said. ##Health## An airline industry source with knowledge of the directive being sent to air carriers told CNN that North American airlines will not be required to suspend all flights between the US and Canada. Some business, diplomatic, educational and family emergency travel will be allowed to continue.

In light of this, North American carriers will soon begin dramatically reducing their US-Canada flight schedules, the source said. The new border restrictions for airlines are expected to be enforced by March 21\u00a0at midnight. ##Travel## Dr. Deborah Birx said during Wednesday\u2019s briefing at the White House that the coronavirus task force is concerned about reports indicating that more young people are becoming seriously ill from coronavirus, suggesting they may have continued to be exposed to the virus because they weren\u2019t concerned about being at risk. \u201cThere are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs,\u201d Birx said. \u201cWe think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea of the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were a particular risk,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt may have been that the millennial generation \u2026 there may be disproportional number of infections among that group and so even if it\u2019s a rare occurrence it may be seen more frequently in that group.\u201d Birx added that the task force has \u201cnot seen any significant mortality in children.\u201d Hear the full announcement: ##Health## The US is putting a temporary pause on refugee admissions in light of the coronavirus pandemic, according to two sources familiar with an administration\u00a0call\u00a0Wednesday morning with\u00a0refugee organizations.

Andrew Cuomo reiterated the virus should peak in 45 days and is again asking for up to 110,000 beds with current capacity of 53,000 beds. Cuomo met yesterday with all hospital administrators to identify up 50,000 new beds. The state will waive Department of Health regulations which include the space in a given room and how many beds are in it. The state has a current capacity of 3,000 ventilators, but Cuomo wants 37,000 ICU units and he equated an ICU bed to a ventilator given the setup. \u201cThat\u2019s our main issue,\u201d Cuomo said, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s a projection and projections can change.\u201d The state needs more current and reserve staff and the state is reaching out to retired nurses and doctors as well as medical and nursing schools to build up reserve capacity. How this may work: In order to get new hospital beds, the state is looking to convert facilities and move people who are currently in hospital beds to a converted facility for a lower level of care should the case apply. Reiterating the needs for a federal partnership, the governor said the state cannot do it on its own.  \u201dWe are very ambitious, very aggressive,\u201d but \u201cKnow what we cannot do.

On the Republican proposals for direct cash payments to Americans, Schumer said, \u201cThis is not a time for small thinking. This is not a time for small measures. This is a time to be bold, to be aggressive \u2026. $1,000 goes by pretty quickly if you\u2019re unemployed. In contrast, expanded unemployment insurance, beefed up unemployment insurance covers you for a much longer time and would provide a much bigger safety net.\u201d  Schumer added: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to provide direct payments, they need to be bigger, more frequent, more targeted. Millionaires shouldn\u2019t get them.\" \u00a0##Daily Life## Speaking on the heels of President Trump's announcement the US-Canadian border will be closed for tourism and recreation, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced new and significant economic measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Neil Ferguson is head of the modelling program at Imperial College London's center for global infectious disease analysis, and it was his team's research that prompted the UK government to impose more restrictive measures to slow the virus' spread.  Ferguson announced his possible infection on Twitter, and told the BBC's Radio 4 program that just days before he had been in touch with the Prime Minister and the country's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance.  \u201cI\u2019ve been in so many meetings in the last few weeks and a number of my colleagues from other universities who\u2019ve been advising government in those meetings have also developed symptoms,\" he told the BBC.  He said he had not had contact with anyone in the 12 hours prior to the onset of his symptoms, so it is possible he was not infectious at the time of his meetings with officials. He added that he wasn't surprised to have developed coronavirus symptoms, adding that central London was a hotspot. ##Health## Hong Kong reported its largest increase in new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, after a period of apparent slowdown in infections.  For most of March, few, if any, cases were reported every day. Today, there were 14 new cases -- all of which except one had recent international travel history. This brings the city's total to 182 cases. Wong Ka-hing, of Hong Kong\u2019s Center for Health Protection, warned today that a huge volume of travelers is expected to arrive in Hong Kong in the coming days, especially as students abroad arrive home after university closures.

Starting Thursday, all international arrivals will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. ##Travel## ##Health## Three American tourists went to Lima, Peru, for a yoga retreat in the Sacred Valley at Munay Sanqo. Now, the borders are shut, the country is under quarantine -- and they're stuck. Lisa Kolker, one of the three friends, told CNN that their flight from Cusco to Lima had been delayed, making them miss the next connecting flight out of Peru, just before the border closed on Sunday.  The abrupt short-notice closures have left her group scrambling to find a way back home, and the next flight they were able to book isn't until April 3. The closures \"literally all happened in the middle of the night when no one could do anything,\" Kolker said. She first heard about the closures on Sunday from \"a random European woman,\" but a lack of information online fed confusion -- it wasn't until the next morning that they realized the seriousness of the situation. She has reached out to the US embassy and the State Department, but hasn't heard back yet. What life in Peru looks like now: Jenn Moeller, one of Kolker's friends, said when the border closures were announced, \"things suddenly went into chaos.\" \"Streets are being patrolled by police and militia with lots of road stops and road closures,\" she told CNN. \"We were allowed to walk to grocery stores and pharmacies today.

Nearly everyone wears masks when they go out on the streets -- a visual representation of the city's widespread, intense efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic.  But there is also rising friction as people warn against complacency and the possibility of a second wave of cases. Earlier this week, the front page of the influential local newspaper Apple Daily criticized expatriates gathering in a bar without masks. The story tapped into a widespread perception among many Hong Kongers, whether true or not, that some of the city's foreign residents have not shared their alarm at the outbreak. The trauma of SARS: Many foreigners living in the city today did not experience the 2003 SARS outbreak, which\u00a0has cast a long shadow over the current response, and made Hong Kongers far more wary and willing to take extreme precautions. Some residents were frustrated at the attitude of a minority of expatriates, including some bosses and colleagues, who belittled or mocked the emergency measures being put in place -- such as wearing masks everywhere or working from home -- ignoring the painful lessons that their locally-born colleagues had learned from SARS. The privilege of escape: There was also a feeling that many foreign passport holders had an easy escape route to other countries that Hong Kongers did not. Another part of the problem is that, while Hong Kong has long advised people to wear face masks in public, other governments have given conflicting advice, and those returning to or going about the city unmaksed may be following the guidance of their home countries.

Indian national Jaskeerat Singh Bakshi is studying medicine in the Philippines capital of Manila. On Monday, the Philippines locked down its largest and most populous island of Luzon -- home to more than 50 million people, including the capital -- in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus.  Foreign nationals were told they had a 72-hour window to voluntarily leave the country.  \"This pushed everybody into panic, most of all the students who comprise the large majority of Indians there,\" Bakshi told CNN.  Bakshi said he got on an early flight the next day to Kolkata with a stop over in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur.  But mid-journey India issued new travel guidelines prohibiting flights entering the country from Afghanistan, Malaysia and Philippines with immediate effect. And Malaysia had that day issued tough restrictions prohibiting any foreign nationals from entering the country.  \"This leaves us with nowhere to go. Our connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to India was canceled,\" he said. \"Neither the Malaysian authorities will accept us nor is there any other way to get to India.\" He and 250 other Indian nationals were left stranded overnight in the airport.  By Wednesday, Bakshi has received good news. The Indian High Commission in Malaysia and India\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry had got involved and said they had secured flights to bring the stranded travelers back home.  Today, Malaysia begins its first day of travel restrictions and business closures. These new measures, which are in effect until March 31, include prohibiting all Malaysian nationals from traveling abroad and all foreigners from entering the country. Mass closures: The measures also include a ban on social, religious and educational gatherings.\u00a0Only essential businesses like prisons and food supply operations are allowed to stay open; restaurants can still operate, but aren't allowed to serve food on premises, and must instead offer only delivery or takeaway.  There is no curfew in place yet and people can still leave their houses -- but it's \"not advised\" to take their families out, Bernama reported, citing government and national security officials. \u201cWe have a small window of opportunity to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission,\" posted Director General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah on Facebook today.\n\u201cFailure is not an option here, otherwise, we might face the 3rd wave of the virus. The next one will\u00a0be as big as a tsunami, more so if we have a lackadaisical attitude,\" he wrote. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## The Philippines has been placed under a \"state of calamity\" for six months due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the state news agency, Philippines News Agency (PNA). The declaration will open up an emergency fund to central and local governments to help fight the virus.  It will also allow the government to call in support from all law enforcement agencies, including the Armed Forces, \"as may be necessary,\" said the PNA report. Upgraded warning: Before the new declaration, the entire country had already been placed under a state of public health emergency on March 9. The Philippines now has reported 187 confirmed cases and 14 deaths due to the coronavirus. ##Health## The numbers:\u00a0Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources, puts the total number of cases worldwide at more than 198,000, with at least 7,900 deaths. Lockdown in Europe and Asia: Millions are\u00a0under lockdown, with countries imposing  restrictions on daily life and travel, and border closures. More flights suspended:\u00a0Sri Lanka has suspended all flights arriving into the country for two weeks, effective midnight today. Meanwhile, United Airlines is cutting even more domestic and international flights, following the US restrictions on travel from the UK and other European countries. Restrictions widen:\u00a0European leaders have decided to ban non-essential travel to the EU for 30 days. US-Canada border crossing limits are expected. Australia has declared a \u201chuman biosecurity emergency\u201d giving the government the power to impose curfews and order people into quarantine if deemed necessary. For the first time, Australia has imposed a Level 4 travel warning -- meaning \"do not travel.\"   US cases in all 50 states:\u00a0Coronavirus is now reported to be in all 50 US states with at least 112 dying from the virus across the country. The number of cases stands at\u00a06,135. State of calamity: The Philippines as been placed under a state of calamity for six months, meaning a response fund will be available to the central and local governments and law enforcement agencies, including the Armed Forces, can be deployed to ensure order in affected areas. More action needed:\u00a0Countries\u00a0in Southeast Asia\u00a0must \u201curgently scale-up aggressive measures\u201d and widespread testing to prevent the coronavirus from spreading further, said World Health Organization officials. German politician chancellery candidate Friedrich Merz has tested positive for the coronavirus, his spokesman confirmed to CNN. Merz also tweeted about testing positive, saying he had mild to moderate symptoms. A veteran politician, Merz recently joined the race for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party leadership. ##Health## Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a \u201chuman biosecurity emergency\u201d today and announced new restrictions to halt the spread of the coronavirus. This declaration of a human biosecurity emergency gives the government the power to impose curfews and order people into quarantine if deemed necessary, Morrison said in a televised address. The new restrictions include an upgraded travel advice to Level 4 -- meaning \"do not travel.\" It's the first time the country has imposed a Level 4 warning, Morrison said. He added that this travel restriction is because the biggest risk comes from imported cases -- \"Australians returning from overseas.\" The government is also banning all non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, effective today. Morrison also urged people to stop panic buying. \"Stop hoarding. I can't be more blunt about it. Stop it,\" he said. It is not sensible, it is not helpful and it has been one of the most disappointing things I have seen in Australian behavior in response to this crisis.\u201d\u00a0 The government also unveiled economic aid. The government announced a $430 million aid package for its airlines.  This comes as the aviation industry worldwide has suffered from the virus; Norwegian Air had to lay off half of all its staff, and an aviation consultancy warned most airlines in the world could be bankrupt by the end of May without government intervention. Australia has reported 454 confirmed cases, of which 43 have recovered and 5 have died.

Russia has 114 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.  Just yesterday, Putin said the\u00a0Russian government had managed to bring the spread of coronavirus \u201cunder control,\u201d even as cases in the country continued to rise. Russia\u00a0has closed its borders with China, restricted flights to and from the European Union, and will be partially and selectively closing its borders to foreign arrivals on Wednesday.\u00a0 ##Health## After months on the frontline of\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong increasingly looks\u00a0like a model\u00a0for how to handle it. Despite having\u00a0numerous transport links with mainland China, where the first cases were detected, and a mobile population working on either side of the border, through intense efforts, including having millions work at home and exercising social distancing, Hong Kong has kept its number of cases comparatively low. To date, Hong Kong, which is home to more than 7 million people, has fewer than 170 cases and four deaths, while other countries and cities have reported hundreds, even thousands, of infections. The biggest visual sign of the city's continued effort has been the almost complete ubiquity of face masks, which began appearing soon after the first coronavirus cases were reported in China, (despite a technical ban on them related to last year's anti-government protests), and soon were seen everywhere, sparking concerns about shortages and long queues at pharmacies that did stock them. But now, fears are growing of a potential second wave of cases -- imported from outside the territory. Some who left the city early in the outbreak are starting to return, while others are being forced to -- many countries which attract large numbers of Hong Kong students are closing universities and going into lockdown -- raising concerns they will bring the coronavirus back with them. On Tuesday, the city's government issued a red notice for all foreign countries, requiring anyone arriving from overseas to undergo a 14-day home quarantine.  Of the 10 new cases reported that day, almost all had recently traveled in Europe or the United States. Read the full analysis here. ##Travel## ##Health## A hockey player for the Ottawa Senators, part of the North American National Hockey League (NHL), has tested positive for the coronavirus. The player was not identified, but a statement from the team said the player was experiencing mild symptoms and was in isolation. The team is now working with health officials to conduct contact tracing. All the other team members are also being isolated.. This is the first publicly known instance of an infected NHL player. Season suspended: The NHL announced last week that it is pausing the rest of the season's games because of the pandemic. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said the move was directly related to the news that an NBA player for the Utah Jazz team had tested positive. The NBA and NHL share facilities and locker rooms, leading to the suspension decision. ##Health## Taiwan is banning most foreign nationals from entering the country in an effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus, announced the island's Epidemic Central Command Center today. \"All foreign nationals, except for those with resident, diplomatic or business credentials or others with special permission, will not be allowed to enter Taiwan,\" said officials at a news conference. They added that travelers coming to the island will be subjected to a mandatory 14-day home quarantine. The restrictions will go into effect tomorrow local time. ##Travel## The numbers:\u00a0Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources, puts the total number of cases worldwide at more than 198,000, with at least 7,900 deaths. Emergency funding: The White House Office of Management and Budget\u00a0is requesting the US Congress for an additional $45.8 billion in the face of a pandemic and Spain has approved a 200 billion euro (almost $220 billion) aid package. More flights suspended: Sri Lanka has suspended all flights arriving into the country for two weeks, effective midnight today. Meanwhile, United Airlines is cutting even more domestic and international flights, following the US restrictions on travel from the UK and other European countries.  Travel restrictions widen:\u00a0European leaders have decided to ban non-essential travel to the EU for 30 days. US-Canada border crossing limits are expected. Macao has banned all travelers from overseas countries from entering. And Taiwan is banning most foreign nationals. Asylum seekers affected: The US administration is pushing to pass\u00a0tough immigration restrictions including blocking entry to asylum seekers. A plan to turn back all migrants seeking asylum would have its most immediate effect on the US-Mexico border. Saudi Arabia: All work in private sectors is being suspended for 15 days. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia banned Muslims from conducting five daily prayers and Friday prayers inside mosques as a precautionary measure. More action needed: Countries in Southeast Asia must \u201curgently scale-up aggressive measures\u201d and widespread testing to prevent the coronavirus from spreading further, said World Health Organization officials.  As the coronavirus continues to spread across the US, states are taking emergency measures to combat the pandemic. Here are some of tonight's latest developments: Hawaii is asking tourists to stay away and postpone their holidays.\nNevada is asking people to stay home, and is ordering non-essential businesses to close for 30 days.\nCalifornia has closed nearly all public schools. In Northern California, nearly 8 million residents are under a shelter in place order.\nSouth Carolina is closing bars and some restaurants, and extending state tax deadlines.\nWashington is looking \u201cbeyond the usual places\u201d to find protective medical equipment.\nWisconsin is closing schools, prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people, and prohibiting restaurants from serving food on premises.\nColorado has deployed members of the National Guard to support local and state response. And the virus finally reached West Virginia, the last uninfected state, today. All 50 states now have cases of the coronavirus. The World Health Organization didn\u2019t offer Covid-19 tests\u00a0to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told CNN on Tuesday. There were no discussions between the WHO and CDC on providing tests, according to Jasarevic, who added that the US typically has the capacity to manufacture its own tests, so it doesn't usually rely on the WHO for them. Separate manufacturers: On January 17, the WHO published a\u00a0protocol from German researchers with the instructions necessary for any country to manufacture coronavirus tests.\u00a0 The US pursued its own design and began testing for the coronavirus at the CDC in Atlanta. On February 5, the CDC\u00a0announced it would begin shipping test kits to public health labs in the US.  One day later, the WHO\u00a0said it had shipped 250,000 tests to more than 70 laboratories around the world. Delays and stumbles in US testing: Days after CDC\u2019s tests shipped, some labs reported that the\u00a0test kits were not working as expected, which eventually required tests to be re-manufactured.\u00a0 On March 1, an official at US Health and Human Services said the agency had launched an investigation into a manufacturing defect in the CDC tests. As of March 9,\u00a0public health labs in all 50 states\u00a0and Washington, DC,\u00a0are able to test for the coronavirus. ##Health## Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have committed $25 million to support organizations responding to the coronavirus outbreak, the company said in a news release Tuesday.\u00a0 The funds will be distributed in grants to address public health needs, food security, and other community needs both locally and internationally, said the release. The first grants are expected to be issued this week.  Here's how it breaks down: $5 million will support global efforts in preventing, detecting and managing the coronavirus\n$10 million will support food banks, school meal programs and organizations that provide access to food for underserved populations\n$10 million will support efforts in US communities and global markets. \u201cIn times of need, we see communities come together to do extraordinary things. This pandemic is no different,\u201d said Kathleen McLaughlin, executive vice president and chief sustainability officer for Walmart and president of the Walmart Foundation.  \"We hope these grants will help to expand critical response efforts as we continue to work together to address the impact of Covid-19.\u201d ##Business## In the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, the US administration is pushing to pass\u00a0tough immigration restrictions including blocking entry to asylum seekers, according to US officials briefed on the plans. A plan to turn back all migrants seeking asylum would have its most immediate effect on the US-Mexico border. It has run into opposition from several government agencies, in part because of concerns that it would violate US and international law, including treaties on how to deal with refugees and victims of torture. Officials are working on a plan to deny entry to all asylum seekers, according to multiple sources. That may include a plan to return all illegal border crossers without due process. US citizens and legal permanent residents will continue to be allowed to enter the US, the official said, adding that the ban won't apply to cargo shipments. However, it is unclear whether others will be allowed to continue to cross legally. Asked for comment, DHS spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement, \"President Trump is 100% focused on protecting the American people,\" adding that \"all options are on the table.\" One official said\u00a0immigration hardliners\u00a0have long looked for ways to try to stop asylum seekers from even having their claims heard by immigration officers, and that the coronavirus threat was being used as an excuse to accomplish what they had so far been unable to.

On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia banned Muslims from conducting five daily prayers and Friday prayers inside mosques as a precautionary measure to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to SPA. Saudi Arabia currently has 171 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. \u00a0##Business## Sri Lanka has suspended all flights arriving into the country for two weeks, effective midnight today for two weeks, said Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in a statement on Twitter. Yesterday, the government also declared a three day public holiday to slow the spread of coronavirus, across all public and private entities except essential services.  \"Please support the effort by staying home & practice social distancing,\" Rajapaksa said in an earlier tweet announcing the holiday. Sri Lanka currently has 44 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. ##Travel## The White House Office of Management and Budget submitted an emergency funding request to the US Congress tonight for an additional $45.8 billion in the face of a pandemic. The sweeping request for new funds and statutory authority came on the same day the Trump administration presented a $1 trillion stimulus proposal on Capitol Hill. \u201cWith the pandemic growing, resource needs have also grown,\u201d Russell Vought, the acting OMB director, wrote in a letter attached to the 118 page request that was sent to lawmakers late Tuesday night.  \u201cThe unprecedented mobilization the Administration has achieved has forced agencies to incur unanticipated costs. These costs must be met with a legislative response to ensure full operational capacity.\u201d Why this matters: The request comes on top the $8.3 billion in emergency funding passed by Congress just two weeks ago -- underscoring just how dramatically financial demands at federal agencies have grown in a matter of days.\u00a0 The request is also viewed by the administration as coming in tandem with the large-scale economic stimulus negotiation, which are expected to have a price tag north of $1 trillion, currently underway on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 The package isn't a complete single solution: It's not meant to be a \"broad-based solution to the major economic dislocation wrought by the virus, nor is it the primary means by which the Federal Government plans to address the hardships of families, individuals, and communities who have been touched by the disease,\u201d Vought wrote.  \u201cWe are currently in active dialogue with the Congress on additional proposals that speak to these broader, vital issues.\u201d Negotiators are planning to include the emergency funding request in the stimulus package currently being discussed, congressional aides tell CNN. ##Business## United Airlines said tonight that it's cutting even more domestic and international flights, following the US restrictions on travel from the UK and other European countries. There will be a 60% schedule reduction in April. This includes cutting international flights by 85%, and flights across the US and Canada by 42%, said the airline. United is making the cuts as it \u201ccontinues to aggressively manage the impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak on our employees, our customers and our business,\" the airline said in a statement. The aviation industry has been slammed by coronavirus. The pandemic has seen airlines around the world hit hard, having to cut flights due to dropping demand and a long list of international travel restrictions. Cebu Pacific, a Philippines carrier, announced yesterday that it was suspending all flights -- domestic and international -- one of the most drastic measures taken so far by an airline.  Many other airlines have, like United, slashed flights and routes. Virgin Atlantic said yesterday it is cutting 80% of its flights per day, and warned that \u201cthe aviation industry is facing unprecedented pressure.\" ##Travel## ##Business## South Korea's Vice Health Minister Kim Ganglip is in self-quarantine, after attending a government meeting last week with another participant who tested positive today. The infected attendee is the president of Bundang Jesaeng Hospital in Seongnam City, Gyeonggi Province, where cluster transmissions have been reported at a church and a hospital. Other government officials and participants at the meeting, which took place last Friday, are also in self-quarantine. This comes as cluster transmissions continue in the country. The country reported 93 new cases and 84 deaths on Wednesday -- still in keeping with. more general trend of decreasing infection rates, compared to hundreds of new cases a day just weeks ago. But the outbreak is far from over, with new clusters identified this week. One major cluster is still in the southern city of Daegu, where the outbreak has been concentrated. In one hospital in Daegu, 74 cases have been confirmed.  ##Health## The numbers: Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking cases reported by the World Health Organization and additional sources, puts the total number of cases worldwide at more than 197,000, with at least 7,900 deaths.
