The dark comic drama \"Joker\" led among nominated films with 11. \"Ford v Ferrari,\" \"The Irishman,\" \"Jojo Rabbit,\" \"Joker,\" \"Little Women,\" \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" \"Marriage Story,\" \"Parasite\" and \"1917\" are vying for best picture this year. Despite efforts in recent years to diversify the Academy's membership, women were shut out of the best director category.  The directing category snub of women led actress Issa Rae, who announced the categories with actor John Cho, to quip \"Congratulations to those men.\" Scarlett Johansson scored a rare double acting nomination for best actress and best supporting actress for her work in \"Marriage Story\" and \"JoJo Rabbit\" respectively. Cynthia Erivo was also nominated for two awards: best actress and original song for \"Stand Up\" both for the film \"Harriet.\"  See below for the list of nominations. This year's awards ceremony will air February 9 on ABC.  As was the case last year, there will be no host.
