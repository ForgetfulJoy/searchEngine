If you're just now reading in, here are the top lines from Fauci's testimony: On reopening: Fauci said there could be \"really serious\" consequences if states and areas reopen prematurely.\nA possible second wave: While the coronavirus will not simply \"disappear\" this fall, Fauci said the threat of a possible second wave can be mitigated by aggressive testing efforts and health-care preparedness. He said that second wave is \"entirely conceivable and\u00a0possible.\"\nMore deaths than reported: Fauci said many experts believe more people have died from coronavirus than have been reported. He said he's not sure \"exactly what percent higher\" the real death toll could be. \"But almost certainly it\u2019s higher,\" he added.\nChildren with Covid-19: Fauci warned against believing children are immune to coronavirus, citing new cases where some children have\u00a0developed a mysterious inflammatory syndrome that could be linked to the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci assured senators today that coronavirus vaccine trials are designed to represent minority and at-risk populations. He said representative trials help determine how effective a vaccine is and what the potential side effects are. \u201cIn the design of our clinical trials and the sites that we\u2019ve chosen in our clinical trial network is going to be very representative of being able to get minority populations and populations at most risk to be part of the trial so we know during the trial what the relative efficacy as well as potential adverse events,\u201d Fauci said during his testimony. He said the process was started back during the HIV crisis, \u201cwhen we tried to get good demographic representation and we\u2019re going to do that with these trials.\u201d The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions' hearing on the US's coronavirus response just wrapped up. The senators heard testimony from four key witnesses: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health; Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Brett Giroir, with the US Department of Health and Human Services; and Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Fauci does not have \u201ctotal control\u201d yet of the coronavirus pandemic and warned that reopening too soon could lead to \"serious\" consequences. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not have a \"confrontational relationship\" with President Trump. Here's how Fauci responded when he was asked by GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler if he had such a relationship with the President:  \"There is certainly not a confrontational relationship\u00a0between me and the President.\u00a0As I've mentioned many times, I give advice and opinion based evidence-based scientific information. He hears that. He respects it. He gets\u00a0opinions from variety of other people.\u00a0But in no way, in my experience over the last several months, has there been any confrontational\u00a0relationship between us.\" US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn also said they did not have confrontational relationships with Trump. Neither President Trump nor his predecessor President Obama are responsible for the lack of a coronavirus vaccine, Dr. Anthony Fauci said. He was responding to GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's question about President Trump's recent suggestion that Obama was responsible for the lack of a vaccine. \"The President\u00a0said the other day that\u00a0President Obama is responsible\u00a0for lack of vaccine. Dr. Fauci,\u00a0is President Obama \u2014 or by extension\u00a0President Trump \u2014 did they do something that made the\u00a0likelihood of creating the vaccine less likely?\" Romney asked. \"Certainly President Obama nor\u00a0President Trump are not\u00a0responsible for not having a\u00a0vaccine,\" Fauci said. He added that the US has moved \"rapidly\" from discovering the virus to having trials for vaccines. Romney then added that he was \"surprised\" by Trump's suggestion. \"That was my impression.\u00a0I was surprised by the comment,\" he said. Dr. Anthony Fauci gave his \u201ccommon-sense guidance\u201d when Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith asked about reopening meat plants and expressed her concerns over deaths and infections there.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you\u2019re calling upon people to perform\u00a0essential services, you really have almost a moral responsibility to\u00a0make sure they are well-taken\u00a0care of and protected,\" he said. \u201cIt would seem that if you want\u00a0to keep things like packing\u00a0plants open, that you really got to\u00a0provide the optimum degree of\u00a0protection for the workers involved, the ability\u00a0to allow them to go to work\u00a0safely, and if and when\u00a0individuals get infected, to\u00a0immediately be able to get them out and\u00a0give them the proper care,\u201d Fauci said.\u00a0 \u201cThat's not an official\u00a0proclamation, that's just me\u00a0speaking as a physician and as a human being,\u201d he added.\u00a0 In late April, President Trump signed an executive order under the Defense Production Act to\u00a0keep meat processing plants open during\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic.  Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, started her five minutes of questions with a simple one for Dr. Anthony Fauci. \"How are you doing and how are\u00a0you holding up?\" she asked him. \"I'm doing fine, senator,\u00a0thank you very much for asking,\" he said. Fauci continued: \"This is, this is such an important\u00a0problem. It transcends all of us\u00a0individually, and we have to be working\u00a0as a team. And I enjoy very much\u00a0working with your senators and\u00a0the governors, because it's at\u00a0the local level that we're going make\u00a0it work.\u00a0So I am fine. I appreciate your\u00a0concern.\" WATCH: Dr. Anthony Fauci, who sits on the White House coronavirus task force, said there is no \u201ceasy answer\u201d to how students go back to school. \u201cWe have a very large country and the dynamics of the outbreak are different in different regions of the country,\u201d Fauci told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions. \u201cSo I would imagine that situations regarding school will be very different in one region versus another, so that it's not going to be universally or homogeneous.\u201d Fauci was asked about the risk-benefit ratio between sending kids back to school and having them miss out on education.  \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very difficult,\" he said. \"The unintended consequences of trying to do something that broadly is important for the public health and the risk of having a return or a resurgence of an outbreak and the unintended deleterious consequences of having children at a school.\" \u201cI don't have a good explanation or solution for the problem of what happens when you close schools and it triggers a cascade of events,\" Fauci added.\u00a0 Dr. Anthony Fauci said the United States does not have \u201ctotal control\u201d yet of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cIf you think that we have it completely under control, we don\u2019t,\u201d he told Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Senate hearing on the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus.\u00a0 \u201cIf you look at the dynamics of\u00a0the outbreak, we are seeing\u00a0a diminution of hospitalizations and infections\u00a0in some places \u2014 such as in New York City, which has plateaued and is starting to come down \u2014 but in other parts\u00a0of the country, we are seeing\u00a0spikes,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Fauci said the coronavirus curve looks flat right now. \u00a0 \u201cI think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but\u00a0the right direction does not\u00a0mean we have, by any means, total control of this outbreak,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Fauci again said that if there is not an \u201cadequate\u201d response by the US in the fall, more infections and deaths are on the horizon.\u00a0 \u201cWe run the risk of\u00a0having a resurgence.\u00a0I would hope by that point in\u00a0time in the fall that we have\u00a0more than enough to respond adequately, but\u00a0if we don't, there will be\u00a0problem,\u201d he said.\u00a0 WATCH: The coronavirus outbreak in the US appears to be \"going in the right direction,\" but the nation does not have it under control, Dr. Anthony Fauci\u00a0said.\u00a0 \"If you think we have it completely under control, no we don\u2019t,\" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci added that while in some states, such as New York, the number of new cases appears to be going down, but there are other areas in the nation where new cases are rising. \"When you look at the dynamics of new cases, even though some are coming down, the curve looks flat with some slight coming down,\" Fauci said. \"So I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak.\" Sen. Chris Murphy asked US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield about the CDC guidance on reopening states that was rejected by the Trump administration. The guidance provided more detailed suggestions beyond the\u00a0reopening guidelines the administration had put forth last month, including specific suggestions for schools and churches.\u00a0 Redfield said the guidance was going through \"interagency review\" and could be posted online \"soon.\" Here's how the exchange between Redfield and Murphy went down: Murphy: \"Why didn't this plan get\u00a0released, and if it is just being\u00a0reviewed, when is it going to be\u00a0released?\u00a0Because states are reopening right now,\u00a0and we need this additional\u00a0guidance to make decisions.\" Redfield: \"Senator, I appreciate your\u00a0question, clearly we have\u00a0generated a series of guidances\u00a0as you know and as this outbreak\u00a0response has evolved from a CDC to an all of government response. As we work through the\u00a0guidances, a number of them\u00a0go for interagency reviews and interagency\u00a0input to make sure these\u00a0guidances are more broadly\u00a0applicable for different parts of our\u00a0society.\u00a0The guidances that you've talked\u00a0about have gone through that interagency review. There are comments that have come back to CDC. And I anticipate to go backup\u00a0into the task force for final\u00a0review.\" Murphy: \"But we are reopening in\u00a0Connecticut in five days, in ten\u00a0days.\u00a0This guidance isn't going to useful to\u00a0us in two weeks.\u00a0Is it this week or next week?\u00a0When are we going to get this\u00a0expertise from the federal\u00a0government?\" Redfield: \"The other thing that I will just say is the CDC stands by to be of technical assistance to your state and any state upon requests, I do\u00a0anticipate these guidance so to\u00a0be posted on the CDC's website\u00a0soon.\" WATCH: Dr. Anthony Fauci warned against believing children are immune to coronavirus, citing new cases where some children have developed a mysterious inflammatory syndrome that could be linked to the virus.  He stressed that experts are still learning about coronavirus. \"We don't know\u00a0everything about this virus, and\u00a0we really better be very\u00a0careful, particularly when it\u00a0comes to\u00a0children, because the\u00a0more and more we learn, we're\u00a0seeing things about what this\u00a0virus can do that we didn't see\u00a0from the studies in China or in\u00a0Europe,\" Fauci said. What this is about: A mysterious illness that's affecting children and could be linked to the\u00a0coronavirus has alarmed officials, who are searching for answers as infections increase. Doctors are referring to the condition that has hospitalized dozens of children as \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\" Three children have died because of it in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. Today, Fauci added: \"I think we should be careful, if\u00a0we're not cavalier in thinking\u00a0that\u00a0children\u00a0are completely\u00a0immune to the deleterious\u00a0effects.\" Fauci added that in general, most children who develop coronavirus \"do much, much better than adults.\" \"But I am very careful, and\u00a0hopefully humble, in knowing that\u00a0I don't know everything about\u00a0this disease and that's why I'm\u00a0very reserved in making broad\u00a0predictions,\" he said. WATCH: Dr. Anthony Fauci issued a warning about states that disregard coronavirus guidelines for safely reopening.\u00a0 \u201cThere is a real risk that you\u00a0will\u00a0trigger\u00a0an outbreak that\u00a0you may not be able to control,\u201d he said. Fauci said those actions would \u201cturn the clock back\u201d on stemming the tide of coronavirus infections.\u00a0 That would \u201cparadoxically set you back, not\u00a0only leading to some suffering\u00a0and death that could be avoided,\u00a0but could even set you back on\u00a0the road to trying to get\u00a0economic recovery,\u201d Fauci said.\u00a0 Sen. Bernie Sanders asked the top three officials testifying on Capitol Hill today if they can guarantee vaccines will be available to all Americans, regardless of their\u00a0income. \u201cIf and when\u00a0the vaccine comes, it won't do\u00a0somebody any good if they don't\u00a0get it.\u00a0And if they have to pay a sum of\u00a0money for it in order to profit\u00a0the drug companies, that will\u00a0not be helpful,\u201d he said. Adm. Brett Giroir of the HHS said he would \u201ccertainly advocate that everyone is able to receive the vaccine regardless of income or any other circumstance.\u201d \"We need to be absolutely certain that if a\u00a0vaccine or an effective\u00a0therapeutic or preventive is\u00a0available that it reaches all\u00a0segments of society regardless\u00a0of their ability to pay or any\u00a0other social determinant of\u00a0health that there may be.\" \u201cThe payment of the vaccines is not a responsibility of the FDA,\u201d Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration said. \u201cI share your concern that this\u00a0needs to be made available to\u00a0every American.\u201d The US will be able to produce, distribute and apply \u201cat least 40 to 50 million tests per month,\u201d Admiral Dr. Brett\u00a0Giroir, the assistant secretary for Health at US Department of Health and Human Services, said.\u00a0 Giroir told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions that since March 12, \u201cthe nation has performed more than 9 million Covid-19 tests.\" Remember: The federal government has been under fire for months for its slow production of tests for the coronavirus. Public health experts universally say regular testing is critical to understanding the spread of Covid-19 and to control it. Giroir indicated it will take a few more months to ramp up production. \u201cBy September, taking every aspect of development, authorization, manufacturing and supply chain into consideration\u00a0\u2014 we project that our nation will be capable of performing at least 40 to 50 million test per month, if needed at that time,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cCollectively, states and territories established an overall goal to perform the 12.9 million tests over the next four weeks. The federal government is able to and will support the achievement of this goal,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said many experts believe more people have died from coronavirus than have been reported. \u201cMost of us feel that the number of deaths are likely higher than that number,\u201d Fauci told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) today. \u201cGiven the situation, particularly in New York City \u2014 when they were really strapped with a very serious challenge to their health care system \u2014 that there may have been people who died at home who did have some Covid who are not counted as Covid because they never really got to the hospital,\u201d Fauci continued. Fauci said he's not sure \"exactly what percent higher\" the real death toll could be. \"But almost certainly it\u2019s higher,\" he added. Dr. Anthony Fauci said that, while the coronavirus will not simply \"disappear\" this fall, he hopes the threat of a possible second wave can be mitigated by aggressive testing efforts and health-care preparedness. Sen. Bernie Sanders asked Fauci, who sits on the White House coronavirus task force, this: \"Are we fearful that if we don't\u00a0get our act together, as bad as\u00a0the situation is now, it could\u00a0become worse in the fall or\u00a0winter?\" Fauci said he believes \"that\u00a0possibility does exist.\" \"And the reason I say\u00a0that is when you talk about 'will\u00a0this virus just\u00a0disappear' \u2014 and\u00a0as I've said publicly many\u00a0times, that is just not going to\u00a0happen because it's such a\u00a0highly transmissible virus,\" Fauci said. \"And\u00a0even if we get better control over the\u00a0next several months, it's likely\u00a0there will be the virus\u00a0somewhere on this planet that\u00a0will eventually get back to us.\" He added that it's \"entirely conceivable and\u00a0possible\" that a second wave will happen this fall. \"I would hope that between\u00a0now and then, given the\u00a0capability of doing the testing\u00a0that you heard from Admiral\u00a0[Brett] Giroir and the ability of us to\u00a0stock up on personal protective\u00a0equipment and the work force\u00a0that the CDC under Dr. [Robert] Redfield\u00a0will be putting forth to be able\u00a0to identify, isolate and contact\u00a0trace \u2014 I hope that if we do have\u00a0the threat of a second wave, we\u00a0will be able to deal with it\u00a0very effectively to prevent it\u00a0from becoming an outbreak,\" Fauci added. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Dr. Fauci: Dr. Anthony Fauci said there could be \"really serious\" consequences if states and areas reopen prematurely. Sen. Patty Murray asked what would happen if a community doesn't follow guidelines from health experts on the phases of reopening. \"The consequences could be\u00a0really\u00a0serious,\" Fauci said Fauci added that there is \"no doubt\" that \"even\u00a0under the best of circumstances,\u00a0when you pull back on\u00a0mitigation, you will see some\u00a0cases appear.\" \"It's the ability and the\u00a0capability of responding to\u00a0those cases with good\u00a0identification, isolation and\u00a0contact tracing will determine\u00a0whether you can continue to go\u00a0forward as you try to reopen\u00a0America,\" he added. \"What I've expressed then and\u00a0again is my concern that if some\u00a0areas, cities, states, what\u00a0have you, jump over prematurely over\u00a0those checkpoints and\u00a0prematurely open up without\u00a0having the capability of being able to respond\u00a0effectively and\u00a0efficiently,\" he said. \"My concern is that\u00a0we'll start to see little spikes\u00a0that might turn into outbreaks.\" The 41 community-based drive-through testing sites across the US, as prioritized by the CDC \u201chave been a profound success,\u201d according to Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health in the Department of HHS. He said the sites have tested more than 167,000\u00a0high-risk individuals. More broadly, the US has performed more than 9 million Covid-19 tests since March 12 \u2014 \u201ca number far greater than any other country and double the per capita task performed to date in South Korea,\u201d he said. Giroir also provided the current status on testing across the US as well as projected some numbers for the coming month: The federal\u00a0government is shipping 12.9 million swabs and over 9.7\u00a0million tubes of media to states in May alone.\nBy the end\u00a0of 2020, the federal government\u00a0will procure over 135 million\u00a0swabs and 132 million tubes of\u00a0media and distribute these to\u00a0states as requested.\n\u00a0By September, taking every\u00a0aspect of development,\u00a0authorization, manufacturing and\u00a0supply chain into consideration,\u00a0the department projects that our\u00a0administration will be capable\u00a0of performing at least 40-50\u00a0million tests per month. Some context: President Trump and administration officials yesterday claimed the US leads the world in\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0testing. While the raw number of tests performed in the US might be the highest, multiple data sources note that the US is not the leader in testing\u00a0per capita and does not do more testing than other countries \"combined,\" as Trump claimed, according to Factcheck.org. Read more here. The first question at today's Senate hearing on coronavirus was about the possibility of college students getting back to campus this fall. Sen. Lamar Alexander asked Dr. Anthony Fauci what he'd say to school officials who are trying persuade students to come back to campus.  \"Let's look down the road three months. There will be about 5,000 campuses across the country trying to welcome 20 million college students,\" Alexander said. Fauci said students might feel safest if there was a vaccine for coronavirus \u2014 but it's a \"bridge too far\" to think a vaccine or treatment will be ready by the time classes start this fall. \"If this were a situation where we had a vaccine, that would really be the end of that issue in a positive way,\" Fauci said. \"We don't see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term.\" Dr. Brett Giroir, with the US Department of Health and Human Services, said the strategy for getting students back on campus is heavily dependent on how much community spread is happening in the fall. He said there would likely be a \"surveillance strategy\" for students going back to class. That would involve testing some students at different times \"to give an assurance that there's no circulation.\"  Watch Fauci: Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said his organization has issued multiple emergency authorizations for coronavirus tests, and they're continuing to review them. He said the FDA is \"monitoring the marketplace for fraudulent tests, and are taking appropriate action to protect the public health.\" Hahn said officials are working to provide \"more clarity\" on which tests have been reviewed by the FDA. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the US must have an extensive capacity to test for coronavirus before the country can lift certain restrictions. \"Rapid, extensive and widely available, timely testing is essential to reopening America,\" he said in his opening remarks to the senate committee. He also said contact tracing is \"critical\" because it can prevent some community transmission. WATCH: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health and an expert on Trump's coronavirus task force, said there are many possible vaccines being worked on \u2014 and researchers hope to develop more than one. \"We have many candidates and hope to have multiple winners,\" Fauci said, explaining that more vaccines will be good for global availability. \"In other words, it's multiple shots on goal,\" Fauci said. \"What our country had done so far in testing is impressive but not nearly enough,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, Chairman of the HELP committee, in his opening remarks. Reopening the country requires large-scale testing, he added. \"In my opinion, this requires\u00a0millions of new tests, many from\u00a0new technologies.\u00a0Some of these will fail, but we\u00a0only need a few successes to get\u00a0where we want to go,\" Alexander said. As he noted his previous conversations around coronavirus treatments and vaccines with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Sen. Alexander said that those are the ultimate solution, but until they are developed, all paths to reopening depend on testing. \"All\u00a0roads back to work and school go\u00a0through testing.\u00a0The more tests we conduct, the\u00a0better we can identify those who\u00a0are sick and exposed, and we can\u00a0quarantine the sick and exposed\u00a0instead of trying to quarantine\u00a0the whole country,\" the senator said. Watch more: Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, said her colleagues on the committee must dig for the truth about coronavirus because Trump is not. \"Truth is essential so people have the facts ... Lives are at stake.\" she said in her opening remarks. \"The President isn't telling the truth \u2014 we must.\" Murray said Trump's response to the pandemic has been a \"disaster,\" citing the nation's lack of testing and shortages in personal protective equipment.  \"The Trump administration's response to this public health emergency so far has been a disaster on its own,\" she said. Sen. Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, said today's hearing will end around 12:30 p.m. ET. Here's how it will play out: Each of the four witnesses will soon give a five-minute opening statement. Here are those witnesses: Dr. Anthony Fauci, National Institutes of Health\nDr. Robert Redfield, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nDr. Brett Giroir, US Department of Health and Human Services\nDr. Stephen Hahn, Food and Drug Administration  After that, each senator on the committee will get five minutes to ask questions. There are 23 members. Sen. Patty Murray, the committee's ranking member, will ask the final questions before the hearing wraps up. The Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee is in session to hear from White House witnesses about the Trump administration's response to coronavirus. Inside the hearing room, senators are seated far apart from each other. Some were seen wearing masks. Some senators are on video conference.  All of the witnesses, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, will testify remotely, following potential exposures to the virus last week.  Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chair of the committee, is also teleconferencing in as he gives his opening statement. US health experts representing the Trump administration, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, are testifying before the Republican-led Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee this morning.  The witnesses, who are all testifying remotely, will soon be sworn in. Here's who will testify: Dr. Anthony Fauci, National Institutes of Health\nDr. Robert Redfield, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nDr. Brett Giroir, US Department of Health and Human Services\nDr. Stephen Hahn, Food and Drug Administration  Dr. Anthony Fauci plans to tell a Senate committee this morning that the country risks \"needless suffering and death\" if states open up too quickly, he told The New York Times late Monday evening. \"If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to: 'Open America Again,' then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country,\" Fauci said in an email to the Times, referring to the federal government's plan for states to re-open. Fauci's planned testimony will fuel a hearing where senators will finally get a chance today to face off over the effectiveness of the Trump administration's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, in what could be one of the only public hearings featuring members of the White House's coronavirus task force. The hearing will be Democrats' first opportunity since March to question leading medical experts \u2014 including Fauci and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield \u2014 about the Trump administration's response. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Dr. Anthony Fauci to not hold anything back at today\u2019s Senate Health Committee oversight hearing on the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cHe needs to tell us that fact\u00a0that we have to be real careful\u00a0or this will come back with a\u00a0vengeance and won't go away as\u00a0quickly as it would,\u201d Sen. Schumer said in an interview with CNN\u2019s John Berman. \u00a0 Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, plans to tell the committee that the country risks \"needless suffering and death\" if states open up too quickly, he told\u00a0The New York Times.\u00a0 Fauci \u201cseems at times\u00a0he's muzzled\u201d by President Trump, Schumer said. \u201cThe President's always lurking\u00a0over his shoulder.\u00a0This is the first time we get to\u00a0hear him without the President\u00a0looking over his shoulder.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump has been like\u00a0an ostrich in this whole crisis.\u00a0He thinks by saying something,\u00a0it becomes true because he wants it to happen, not that it will happen.\u00a0\u2026 Two months ago, he said everyone\u00a0who wants a test can get a test.\u00a0That clearly wasn't true,\u201d Schumer said.\u00a0\n\u201cDr. Fauci is a truth teller.\u00a0That's his reputation.\u00a0It seems he has sort of muted\u00a0the truth some in the presence\u00a0of the President, maybe\u00a0admonitions privately from the\u00a0President. He has to tell the\u00a0whole truth here.\u201d Schumer said that Fauci should underscore that states need much more testing \u2014 with numbers in the millions \u2014 in order to reopen safely.\u00a0 Schumer also called for a \u201cbig, bold plan\u201d as Democrats push forward on another stimulus package.\u00a0 Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are sitting back and \u201cbehaving\u00a0like Herbert Hoover before the\u00a0Great Depression,\u201d Schumer added.\u00a0 Watch more: All of the witnesses set to participate in this morning\u2019s Senate committee hearing on the novel coronavirus, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, will testify remotely, following potential exposures to the virus last week. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee will also chair the hearing remotely after announcing Sunday that he is self-quarantining for 14 days as a result of a staffer in his office testing positive to the virus.\u00a0\u00a0 What we know about the White House Covid-19 cases: Recently, President Trump's personal valet, the vice president's spokeswoman, Katie Miller, and Ivanka Trump's personal assistant (who has been teleworking for nearly two months) all tested positive for Covid-19 as well.\u00a0\u00a0 Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, had originally planned to appear in person before the Republican-led Senate Health Committee.  Fauci said Sunday he is engaging in what he calls a \"modified quarantine\" and will work from home. Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 a key member of the administration's coronavirus task force \u2014 will testify remotely at 10 a.m. ET before the Republican-led Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.\u00a0 The hearing will give senators on the panel a chance to hear \"about what federal, state and local governments are doing to help Americans go back to work and back to school as rapidly and safely as possible,\" according to a release from the committee. Why Fauci\u2019s testimony matters: Dr. Anthony Fauci has become a rare source of frank honesty from within the White House coronavirus task force, holding firm with an at times overly optimistic President and recommending steps forward in the face of crisis. The veteran doctor also hasn't been afraid to refute Trump to his face, especially with regards to a timeline for a novel coronavirus vaccine. Fauci serves as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and has been a doctor for the National Institutes of Health for more than 50 years. Here is the full list of witnesses: Dr. Anthony Fauci, with the National Institutes of Health\nDr. Robert Redfield, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Preevention\nDr. Brett Giroir, with the US Department of Health and Human Services\nDr. Stephen Hahn, with the Food and Drug Administration "], "Language": false}
