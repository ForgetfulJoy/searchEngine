Follow developments from the globe here. Some retails stores in Los Angeles will be able to open starting Friday, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced in a news conference Wednesday. Garcetti said he plans to modify the safer at home order in the city of Los Angeles. Florists, toy stores, music stores, book stores, clothing stores and sporting goods stores in Los Angeles may offer curbside pickup, he said. Car dealerships will also be able to open.\u00a0 Some context: This is in line with what Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said in an earlier news conference. He clarified that stores will only able to offer curbside pickup and that people will not able to go inside the stores. Starting Saturday, the city will open its trails, parks and golf courses. Face coverings will be required at all city trails and golf courses, Garcetti said. Runyon canyon will remain closed. Friday May 8 marks the beginning of phase two, a slow and gradual loosening of some of the restrictions, he said.\u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned President Trump's decision to continue to push the Supreme Court to repeal the Affordable Care Act while the coronavirus pandemic persists, saying it's \"tone-deaf.\" \"We have millions of people losing their health care,\" Schumer told CNN's Erin Burnett tonight. \"We have so many people who have preexisting conditions who need help. And they say get rid of all that in the midst of a crisis. How tone-deaf can they be?\" Attorney General William Barr made a last-minute request on Monday to\u00a0modify the administration's position,\u00a0arguing that they should pull back from its insistence that the entire law be struck down. \"How can they do this?\" asked Schumer. \"I am just utterly amazed.\u00a0They stick to this right-wing\u00a0ideology which helps a few very\u00a0well-to-do people and say to the\u00a0rest of America let's fiddle. Which is\u00a0what they're doing while\u00a0America is in many ways burning.\" Watch here: A warehouse worker at Amazon\u2019s Waukegan, Illinois, site died of Covid-19 on April 18, according to the company.  He is the fourth Amazon warehouse employee known to have died from the disease across the United States. \u201cWe are saddened by the loss of an associate at our site in Waukegan, Illinois. His family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting his fellow colleagues,\u201d Kristen Kish, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. According to Amazon, the employee was last on site on March 19, and showed no symptoms.\u00a0 The company confirmed the death of an warehouse worker at Amazon\u2019s Staten Island fulfillment center Tuesday and has previously confirmed two additional Covid-19-related deaths of workers employed at its US warehouses in Hawthorne, California, and Tracy, California. There are at least\u00a01,223,468\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a0at least\u00a073,039\u00a0people have died from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases. Johns Hopkins reported\u00a019,117\u00a0new cases and\u00a01,975\u00a0reported deaths on Wednesday. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases. The Pentagon is considering a ban on new recruits joining the military if they have been hospitalized for coronavirus unless they get a waiver from the service they want to sign up with, according to a defense official. The official said the guidance is being put in place because there is little understanding of the long-term effects of the virus and there is a concern that potential recruits who have been hospitalized may need further medical assessments. The new policy is being finalized to set medical restrictions on recruits who may have tested positive or have been treated for the virus. Department of Defense medical waivers are required for a wide variety of medical conditions ranging from heart disease to a loss of vision. The Military Times was first to report the news. Some more context: Months into the pandemic, the virus is posing significant medical challenges to the military on several fronts. There is a particular concern over whether a sufficient number of recruits will be able to join before a rigorous enough testing regime is in place to ensure they are healthy enough to enter training. The fact sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt are still testing positive weeks after the outbreak of the virus on the ship is underlining the need to solve the medical mystery of why some people carry the virus but have no symptoms and may continue to test negative, according to several Navy officials. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said at the Pentagon Tuesday that the department would randomly test groups of people \"to understand how many asymptomatic or carriers are maybe out there.\"\u00a0 The New York Police Department announced another three deaths related to Covid-19, bringing the department death toll to 41. \"These remarkable men will never be forgotten. Every member of the NYPD, of all ranks and titles, will keep their memories alive and honor their legacies by faithfully carrying on their most important work,\" the police department said in a statement. Arkansas plans to test 60,000 people in the month of May and hopes to receive\u00a090,000 Covid-19 test kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week,\u00a0Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday. The Arkansas Department of Health\u2019s website stated that 59,003 coronavirus tests have been administered so far. The Louisiana Department of Health has reported that the state has 30,399 coronavirus cases, which represents an increase of 403 cases from Tuesday.\u00a0 The state death total increased by 53 to a total of 2,094.\u00a0 In Orleans Parish, the total number of cases increased by 33 cases to a total of 6,608 and the number of deaths increased by 11 to 464. On a positive note, the number of hospitalizations and those on ventilators decreased during this 24-hour period, the department said. \u00a0 The US Supreme Court won't hear an appeal by a Pennsylvania politician and businesses to lift the state's coronavirus restrictions. Without comment, the court\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0declined to hear the case. Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close due to the coronavirus pandemic, although the state has now begun to reduce some restrictions in certain areas. The appeal \u2014 filed by the campaign of Danny DeVito, an Allegheny County Republican, realtor Kathy Gregory, \"B and J\" laundry, Blueberry Hill golf course and Caledonia Land Company \u2014 asserted that the Democratic governor's order is doing \"unprecedented damage to the economy.\" Without intervention, the petitioners say they and \"tens of thousands of other businesses may not be able to recover from the severe financial distress caused by the Order.\" The Pennsylvania state Supreme Court rejected the challenge to the Wolf's order last month. California Gov. Gavin Newsom dispelled any rumors Wednesday afternoon that he has gotten a haircut during California's social distancing guidelines.  \u201cI think it's pretty obvious to you I have not had my hair cut,\u201d he said sheepishly in reply to a reporter question in his daily briefing. \u201cI am a little embarrassed having this conversation as publicly as I am.\u201d\u00a0 Newsom, who is somewhat known for his slicked back tresses, said he is abiding by his own orders, much to the embarrassment of his 6-year-old daughter, Brooklyn. He said Brooklyn offered to cut her father\u2019s hair for him and even presented her craft scissors for the job, which Newsom said \u201ccertainly weren\u2019t up for the task.\u201d Los Angeles, the most populated county in California, will begin to reopen Friday, along with the rest of the state. Trails, golf courses, car dealerships, and florists are among those being allowed to reopen, as are retail shops for curbside pickup, according to county supervisor Kathryn Barger. Los Angeles has seen 1,367 deaths due to Covid-19, making up for more than half of all fatalities in the state. Health Director Barbara Ferrer emphasized that the lifting of restrictions will be slow, with other low risk, nonessential businesses reopening soon, but in a drastically modified way. Employees should continue to telework whenever possible, Ferrer said. ##Reopening## White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said it is \u201csimply nonsensical\u201d to suggest that every individual in the country needs to be tested in order for the country to reopen. \u201cLet\u2019s dismiss a myth about tests right now. If we tested every single American in this country at this moment, we\u2019d have to retest them an hour later and an hour later after that. Because at any moment you could theoretically contract this virus,\u201d McEnany said in her second briefing as press secretary.\u00a0 McEnany was asked specifically\u00a0whether Americans should feel safe to return to work without receiving a coronavirus test \u2014 something President Trump and members of the administration routinely receive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo the notion that everyone needs to be tested is just simply nonsensical. The people that need to be tested are vulnerable populations,\" she said. \u201cWe have to be strategic with our testing and we have done that so far,\" McEnany added. CNN's Health Unit reports doctors say it\u2019s not realistic to test all 328 million people in the US, especially since many\u00a0states are still struggling to get enough tests\u00a0or testing supplies. So in order for the economy to reopen and stay open, the US will need to triple its number of tests performed every day \u2014 from 150,000 tests a day to at least 500,000,\u00a0three Harvard researchers found. And the proportion of test results that come back positive needs to be much lower. About 20% of US test results have been positive, which is \u201cclearly way too high,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Tsai, one of the Harvard researchers. The World Health Organization said an adequate range of positive test results would be 3% to 12%. Germany and South Korea have already met that goal, Tsai said. Watch here: CNN's Holly Yan and Scottie Andrew contributed to this reporting. The Department of Justice and the FBI are scrutinizing California\u2019s large contracts for personal protective equipment after some early contracts went \u201cawry,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. His comments come after details of the nearly $1 billion contract between the state of California and BYD, a Chinese car maker, for masks are still not public.  Newsom said he promise the contract will be published soon. He said the urgency of the outbreak required quick action and says he is looking forward to making the contract public.  \u201cWe negotiated a pretty good price considering others were paying 12 bucks a mask and the federal government was paying six, seven, eight dollars per mask,\" he said. Last month, Newsom made the dramatic announcement on MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow Show that the state had secured deals to acquire more than 200 million protective masks each month.  Since then, the terms of the agreement have been shrouded in secrecy. Each mask will cost the state $3.30, according to Frank Girardot, spokesman for BYD, whose initials stand for Build Your Dreams, with a breakdown of $2.88 for the mask itself, $0.22 in shipping costs, and another $0.20 in duty. Eneida Becot's husband Ed worked at Brooklyn Hospital Center transporting patients for tests before losing his life to Covid-19 about one month ago. Speaking with CNN's Kate Bolduan this afternoon, she said he was likely exposed to the virus at the hospital before the \"severity and the impact\" was well known.\u00a0 \"My husband sacrificed his life taking care of others,\" she said. \"He just had a heart of gold... the world needs more people like him. He was selfless.\" Becot said she wants the world to know that besides medical workers' heroic fight against the pandemic, there are many like her husband, including transporters, security staff, housekeepers, clerks, food service works and others who are also putting their lives on the line each day. \"They also play a role and interact with patients,\" she said. \"They are just as important as the doctors and the nurses. They should be acknowledged and they play a vital role in [patient's] care.\" \u00a0 The White House claimed Wednesday that Democrats acted in poor faith when attempting to schedule a hearing with Dr. Anthony Fauci, who the administration is blocking from testifying in the House even as it allows him to answer questions from the Republican-held Senate. Kayleigh McEnany, the press secretary, said the Democratic appropriations chairwoman attempted a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d by refusing to answer the White House\u2019s questions about the topic for the hearing.\u00a0 \u201cWe don't have time in the middle of a pandemic for publicity stunts,\u201d McEnany said. House Democrats have charged the White House with stonewalling their attempts at conducting oversight of the administration\u2019s coronavirus response by disallowing administration officials from appearing without the explicit permission of chief of staff Mark Meadows. McEnany said Meadows held three phone calls this week with House Appropriations Committee chairwoman Nita Lowey to ascertain the purpose of the hearing at which Fauci was requested to appear. Fauci has been heavily involved in the response to the coronavirus, the biggest public heath crisis in decades. Lowey was \u201cunable\u201d to tell Meadows the subject matter for the hearing, according to McEnany. She said as part of his appearance before a Senate committee next week, Fauci would be questioned by Democrats and Republicans alike. And she said the House needed to \u201cact in good faith\u201d in calling administration officials to testify. Asked earlier this week why Fauci wouldn\u2019t appear before House committees, President Trump said the House amounted to \u201cTrump-haters\u201d who were trying to destroy him politically. Watch here: Self-identified Hispanics are testing positive at a higher rate than any other demographic in Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cAlthough nearly half of those who have been tested did not fill out their demographic information, of those who did 7.6% self-identified as Hispanic. Of these more than 26,000 individuals, nearly 16,000 of them have tested positive for Covid-19. That's a positivity rate of 60%,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThat's nearly three times our state average.\u201d He added: \u201cDecades of institutional inequities and obstacles for members of our Latinx communities are now amplified in this pandemic. And while we can't fix generations of history in the span of a few months, we must advance equity in our public health response today, everywhere and anywhere we can.\u201d Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot previously said Wednesday that Latino residents make up the largest percentage of Covid-19 cases in the city.\u00a0They represent 37% of Covid-19 cases in the city and 25% of deaths. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union on Wednesday said at least 27 meatpacking workers have died because Covid-19. The UFCW also said that according to internal estimates, nearly 8,000 of their meat packing members have been \u201cdirectly impacted\u201d by Covid-19, including \u201cthose who have been hospitalized, tested positive, are awaiting test results, are showing symptoms, or have been exposed.\u201d South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said she expects a \"big increase in positive\" coronavirus cases after employees at a Smithfield Foods processing plant in Sioux Falls were tested for Covid-19. Noem said approximately 1,100 tests were given on the second day of the event, bringing the total number of tests to approximately 2,600. \u201cI want to remind everybody that given this testing that we\u2019re seeing, we expect that this will drive our case numbers up. So I want to prepare everybody that as we do more and more\u00a0testing in a community where there is already community spread, we do expect to see a big increase in positive cases,\" she said. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has announced that the City Council has approved a $15 million rent relief fund for the Texas city. \"The program provides much-needed assistance for our residents. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected constituents economically, forcing many to make tough choices,\" the statement from the mayor's office said.\u00a0 The money for the program will come from the federal CARES Act, according to the statement. Landlords would need to agree to certain terms if they choose to participate in the program, and renters must meet certain requirements. \"The program is expected to help at 6,818 households,\"\u00a0the statement said.\u00a0 White House\u00a0press secretary\u00a0Kayleigh McEnany discussed the strained relationship between the US and China this afternoon during a news briefing. \"Right now, it's a\u00a0relationship of disappointment\u00a0and frustration because the\u00a0President has said how\u00a0frustrated he is that some of\u00a0the decisions of China put\u00a0American lives at risk,\" McEnany said. In recent weeks, President Trump, along with several administration officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, have spoken to dozens of foreign allies about ways to collectively address what the\u00a0White House says was China's intentional effort\u00a0to conceal the severity of the outbreak, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Some more context: A nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party has dismissed claims by the Trump administration that\u00a0the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory, as the war of words over the pandemic escalates between Washington and Beijing. Pompeo said Sunday\u00a0in an interview with ABC that there was \"enormous evidence\" Covid-19 originated in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December. He did not provide details to support the claim. Responding to Pompeo's comments, China's state owned Global Times newspaper said in\u00a0an editorial\u00a0Monday that the former CIA director had \"stunned the world with groundless accusations.\" \"Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by 'enormous evidence,' then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool,\" the editorial said. \"The truth is that Pompeo does not have any evidence, and during Sunday's interview, he was bluffing.\" Watch here: Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike announced at a news conference Wednesday that the state has seen 2,270 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours and 136 additional deaths. This brings the total state count to 68,232 cases and 2,974 deaths, Ezike said. President Trump affirmed that he believes the number of reported US deaths from coronavirus is correct, but says he doesn\u2019t believe the numbers being reported by \u201cother countries.\" During a meeting with the governor of Iowa, Trump was asked if he believes the reported death toll in the United States.\u00a0 \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cDo I believe them? Yeah.\u201d Trump went on to say that he doesn't believe the figures out of China and doesn't \"believe them from other countries, where I see you know, a very tiny number of people died, but you\u2019re watching the news and you see what\u2019s going on.\"\u00a0 Trump conceded that \u201cit\u2019s a big number\u201d being reported, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a number\u2026 that\u2019s at the very lower scale of any number that was predicted.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNow it\u2019s time to open up our country. We\u2019ve got to open up our country,\u201d Trump said. President Trump said Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx will remain in their current roles on the coronavirus task force, the same day he announced it would continue \u201cindefinitely.\u201d The President was asked what Fauci\u2019s role will be moving forward during a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. \u201cSame as it is,\u201d the President answered. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing a very good job, we\u2019re very happy with Dr. Fauci, and he\u2019ll be doing the same. And Deborah will be doing the same,\u201d he added.\u00a0 \u201cI know you\u2019ll be staying,\u201d he said to Birx, who was in the room. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be staying. We\u2019ll miss you otherwise. She\u2019s done a fantastic job. Both, both. Same thing.\u201d Trump said that the White House would be \u201cadding some names\u201d to the group and \u201cmay take off a couple that frankly, their expertise no longer applies.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to say who was being considered for the task force, \u201cbecause some people aren\u2019t going to make it.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cPeople want to be on the task force. They want to be on everything. You know, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this, anything having to do with this, they want to help,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all I do, I get calls from people, the biggest people they want to be on,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cEnemies of mine. People that don\u2019t like me want to be on the committees. I say, \u2018that\u2019s strange.\u2019\u201d The President said that in this case, they\u2019re looking at very \u201cprofessional\u201d names, not just people who want the status of being on the task force. \u201cWe don\u2019t need status,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need results.\u201d Interior Secretary David Bernhardt asked people to practice social distancing in a tweet today, while sharing photographs of himself neither social distancing nor wearing a mask.\u00a0 Asked about the photos, here's what the Interior Department said: \u201cSecretary Bernhardt is going to work alongside the Department\u2019s employees and assist in their valiant efforts to make our public lands accessible to all people. Nothing beats the sun on your back and the wind in your face at a park. Yesterday, Secretary was outdoors at Great Smoky Mountains National Park conducting a site inspection as the park prepares to once again welcome the public in a couple of days.\u201d Oklahoma is on track for phase two of the plan to reopen the state on May 15, according to Gov. Kevin Stitt.\u00a0\u00a0 Oklahoma's phase two includes resuming nonessential travel and some organized sports activities. However, residents over 65 years old must follow the state's stay-at-home order, Stitt said.\u00a0\u00a0 The governor said Oklahoma is \"doing a fantastic job flattening the curve.\"  Stitt went on to say that they \"will continue to make decisions based on the data in Oklahoma\" and officials can extend phases or \"back up\" if they see any changes. \"Like I said back in April the better we do with social distancing the quicker we would get back to normal and that remains true today,\" he said. ##Reopening##\u00a0 Indiana Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box announced 862 additional confirmed coronavirus cases Wednesday, bringing the statewide total to 21,870 since the start of the pandemic. There have been 51 additional deaths reported in the past day, making the statewide total death toll 1,264. That figure does not include 113 deaths that the state suspects were from Covid-19 based on symptoms and X-ray evidence. The state opened 20 testing locations today as part of a statewide effort to ramp up testing.\u00a0 Most of the press conference focused on showcasing efforts of two regional chambers of commerce to prepare businesses for phased reopenings. Dr. Kristen Dauss, chief medical officer of the Indiana Department of Corrections, acknowledged a hot spot in Hendricks County correctional facilities, which constituted 68 of the new cases reported today. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she anticipates letting her statewide stay-at-home order expire on Friday, but she still asked that Rhode Islanders not \u201crace to see mom\u201d on Sunday. \u201cMother\u2019s Day is going to have to be different,\u201d Raimondo warned at her Wednesday press conference. \u201cIf we start planning now we can figure out a way to love, cherish, respect, and treat our moms.\u201d By the numbers: Rhode Island has 10,205 total positive COVID-19 cases and 370 deaths.\u00a0 ##Reopening## Maryland Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon announced today that schools will be closed to in-person learning for the remainder of the academic school year. \u201cAfter an extensive discussion with the Maryland Board of Education, the Maryland Health Department, and additional health experts advising the governor, I am convinced this is the appropriate decision in order to continue to protect the health and safety of our students, educators, staff, and all members of school communities throughout Maryland,\u201d Salmon said. According to Salmon, online and distance learning opportunities will continue to guide school systems. The State Department of Education is also releasing a comprehensive plan for long-term recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. \u00a0 As he honored nurses in the Oval Office Tuesday, President Trump also seemed to get irritated with one nurse who called supplies of personal protective gear around the country, \u201csporadic.\u201d A reporter asked nurses in attendance for a National Nurse Day event if their PPE supplies are where they need to be, and many of them nodded in agreement or answered affirmatively. \u201cI think it\u2019s sporadic,\u201d one nurse answered. \u201cI mean, I talk to my colleagues around the country, certainly there are pockets around the country where PPE is not ideal, but this is an unprecedented time,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cThe infection control measures that we learned back when we went to school, one gown and one mask for one patient per day \u2014 this is a different time,\u201d she continued, adding that she has been reusing a single N95 mask for \u201ca few weeks now.\u201d The nurse said she works at a community health center in New Orleans, and that her youngest Covid-19 patient was a four-day-old infant. \u201cPPE has been sporadic, but it\u2019s been manageable. And we do what we have to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are nurses and we learn to adapt and do whatever we can do for our patients to get the job done and the care provided, and that's what we will continue to do as Covid-19 continues.\u201d \u201cSporadic for you but not sporadic for a lot of other people,\u201d the President told her. \u201cOh no, I agree, Mr. President,\u201d she answered. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve heard the opposite,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have heard that they are loaded up with gallons now. We had empty shelves and empty nothing because it wasn't put there by the last administration.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Watch here: California officials partially reopened Newport Beach in Orange County today for \"active recreational use,\" the city announced in a statement. Last week, thousands of people crowded the Orange County coastline amid the statewide stay-at-home order. The city's reopening plan is consistent with other neighboring California cities that have also loosened beach restrictions in\u00a0alignment with public health guidelines.\u00a0 \u201cThe City is very pleased to reopen our beaches for the physical and mental well-being of our residents,\u201d Mayor Will O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWhile the active recreation model was not the preferred choice by the City Council after discussions with our public safety personnel, we are confident that City staff will manage the beaches effectively under the approved plan.\u201d According to the statement, Newport Beach is now open for the following limited activities during normal beach hours:\u00a0walking, running, hiking, bicycle riding, swimming, surfing, and kayaking. The beach\u00a0will remain closed to\u00a0passive games, loitering, sunbathing and gatherings of people outside of those within their immediate household. Newport officials plan to reopen additional recreational facilities in the coming days and weeks while maintaining social distancing protocol, the statement said. ##Reopening## \u00a0 President Trump said he would like to see schools open in \u201cmost of the country,\" suggesting that children may have stronger immune systems than adults. But he didn\u2019t address concerns that opening schools could lead to a widespread increase of the disease if children bring the virus home. \u201cThe schools should open,\u201d the President said, responding to a question about if schools should reopen in August. \u201cThe one thing you should be careful of is when instructors are over 60.\u201d He then asked Dr. Deborah Birx to respond as well, who was more measured in her answer. She said it is, \u201ca county by county, state by state decision,\u201d whether or not to reopen.\u00a0 \u201cI would like to see schools open, wherever possible, which is I think in much of the country. Most of the country,\u201d the President said after Birx\u2019s comments.\u00a0 \u201cI would say that till everything is perfect, I think the teachers that are a certain age, perhaps you say over 60, especially if they have a problem with heart, or diabetes or any one of a number of things, I think they should not be teaching school for a while, and everyone would understand that fully,\u201d he continued. But Trump added that children are faring relatively well with Covid-19.\u00a0 \u201cWe realize how strong children are, right? Their immune system is just a little bit different. Maybe it\u2019s just a little bit stronger, or maybe it\u2019s a lot stronger, right? It could be a lot stronger,\u201d he said. A Michigan-based Ford plant will continue to produce personal protective equipment and ventilators \u201cas long as the need is there,\u201d said Jim Baumbick, vice president of Ford Enterprise Product Line Management. Baumbick said a facility that was previously used to assemble batteries is now producing ventilators. \u201c[When] we\u2019ve met that demand, then we can we can determine when we would actually dial it down,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s John King. Factory workers are practicing social distancing and safety protocols are in place, including trying new technologies to help enforce safety standard, Baumbick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just social distancing, but watches that actually determine whether or not you\u2019ve come in close proximity to try and determine what a typical and appropriate level social distancing is,\u201d he added. WATCH:  President Trump said he wore a mask during a tour of a Honeywell factory in Arizona on Tuesday. Trump, speaking to reporters today, said he can\u2019t help it if you didn\u2019t see him. Speaking in front of nurses in the Oval Office \u2013 who were wearing scrubs and gowns, but no masks \u2013 Trump was asked why he wasn\u2019t wearing a mask at the facility the day prior. \u201cI actually did have one, no,\u201d he responded, \u201cI put a mask on\u2014yeah. I had a mask on for a period of time.\u201d When a reporter said that none of the press saw him wearing a mask, Trump shot back: \u201cI can\u2019t help it if you didn\u2019t see me.\u201d \u201cI mean I had a mask on but I didn\u2019t need it, and I asked specifically the head of Honeywell, \u2018should I wear a mask?\u2019 And he said, \u2018well you don\u2019t need one in this territory,\u2019 and as you knew, we were far away from people \u2014 from the people making the masks. They were making the masks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did put a mask on and it was a Honeywell mask, actually. And I also had a 3M mask, and I had about four other masks, but I did have it on. I don\u2019t know if you saw it, but I did have it on,\u201d he said. Pressed on how long he wore the mask, the President paused slightly, and responded that it wasn\u2019t \u201ctoo long.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot too long,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had it on. I had it on back \u2014 backstage. But they said you didn\u2019t need it, so, I didn\u2019t need it. And by the way if you noticed nobody else had it on that was in the group.\u201d\u00a0 Video from the facility shows workers wearing masks, which the President admitted.\u00a0 \u201cThe workers had them on yeah, the workers were there. Because they\u2019re working next to each other,\u201d he said. When another reporter asked how it looks for him to be in public not wearing a mask or practicing social distancing, the President seemed to have had enough.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m trying to be nice,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m signing a bill, and you criticize us. Look here\u2019s the story: there\u2019s nothing I can do to satisfy the media, the Democrats, who are the fake news. And I understand that.\u201d President Trump on Wednesday said he didn\u2019t realize how popular the coronavirus task force is, and that\u2019s why he has backed off a plan to get rid of the group in its current form. \u201cIt\u2019s had great success, and Mike Pence has done a fantastic job,\u201d the President said during a meeting with nurses in the Oval Office Wednesday. \u201cI thought we could wind it down sooner, but I had no idea how popular the task force is.\u201d Trump said that when he started talking about phasing out the task force, he got \u201ccalls from very respected people saying, \u2018I think it would be better to keep it going.\u2019\u201d \u201cI learned yesterday that the task force is, something you knew, very respected. People said we should keep it going,\u201d he told reporters\u00a0 \u201cIt is appreciated by the public,\u201d he said, \u201cWhen you look at the job we\u2019ve done on everything.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving the task force indefinitely, we\u2019ll see at a certain point that will end like things end,\u201d Trump said. The White House will be adding \u201ctwo or three\u201d people to the task force, Trump announced.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ll be adding some people to the task force and they\u2019ll be more in the neighborhood of opening our country,\u201d he said, adding that some members who were more involved with producing ventilators may be leaving, but \u201cif they want to stay they can.\u201d There is a \u201cwhole list\u201d of people who want to be on the task force, Trump said, and the new members will be announced on Monday. \u201cI guess if you think we\u2019re always winding it down,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a question of what the end point is.\u201d More on this: Earlier Wednesday,\u00a0CNN reported Trump declared his coronavirus task force would continue \"indefinitely\" a day after he and Vice President Mike Pence said they were phasing out the health-focused panel in favor of a group focused on reopening the economy. According to Pence's public schedule, the task force was slated to meet at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Some health experts had sounded alarm at the apparent disbanding of the task force since cases continue to arise. After touting achievements on testing and supplies, Trump said during a visit to a mask production facility in Arizona on Tuesday he was \"looking at a little bit of a different form\" for the task force \"and that form is safety and opening.\" Pence told reporters during a discussion in his office that administration officials were \"having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level.\" Pence said the discussions are a \"reflection of the tremendous progress we've made as a country.\" But a day later, Trump wrote on Twitter the task force would \"continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.\" \"We may add or subtract people to it, as appropriate,\" he wrote. \"The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics. Thank you!\" As of Wednesday morning, 495 members of New Jersey law enforcement were positive for Covid-19 across the state, New Jersey State Police Col. Pat Callahan told reporters.\u00a0 The number represents a decrease of just over 4% in the last day, he said. At least 396 officers are currently out quarantined, Callahan added.\u00a0 Blood thinning drugs may help save some patients worst affected by the new coronavirus, doctors reported Wednesday. Their findings could point a way to help the virus-related issue of blood clots throughout the body. The team at Mount Sinai Hospital says it is now running experiments to see which anticoagulants may work best, and at which doses.\u00a0 \u201cOur findings suggest that systemic anticoagulants may be associated with improved outcomes among patients hospitalized with Covid-19,\u201d they wrote in their report, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Dr. Valentin Fuster,\u00a0director of Mount Sinai Heart and physician-in-chief of the Mount Sinai Hospital, and colleagues looked at more than 2,700 patients treated at Mount Sinai in New York City, which has been hit hard by coronavirus. Starting in March, some patients were given anti-clotting drugs based on bedside decisions made by doctors. The team started taking a systematic look at whether the drugs made a difference. They did, especially for patients who were put on ventilators to help them breathe. They found 29% of patients on ventilators who were given blood thinners died, compared to 63% of patients on ventilators who were not given blood thinners. \u201cThe patients who received anticoagulants did better than those who didn\u2019t,\u201d Fuster\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0 The findings are not clear-cut enough yet to make solid recommendations. The team noted that patients who were already severely ill were more likely to be given the blood thinners. The researchers did not find that the patients who got blood thinners were significantly more likely to have bleeding problems \u2013 one of the risks of the drugs. \u00a0Watch here: At least 4,893 incarcerated or detained people have contracted Covid-19, and at least 88 have died, according to a report released Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The numbers are almost certainly an undercount, but they underscore just how vulnerable the nation\u2019s jails and prisons are to coronavirus outbreaks. At least 2,778 staff members have tested positive, too, resulting in 15 deaths, according to the report. The findings are based on data from 37 state and territorial health departments. The CDC reached out to 54 jurisdictions, but about 30% did not provide requested information on jails and prisons. Still, the CDC found that 420 correctional or detention facilities across the United States have reported infections\u00a0\u2013\u00a0resulting in at least 491 coronavirus-related hospitalizations among inmates\u00a0and\u00a079 hospitalizations among staff. Researchers looked at cases reported through April 21.\u00a0 \u201cApproximately one half of facilities with COVID-19 cases reported them among staff members but not among incarcerated persons,\u201d the report said. \u201cBecause staff members move between correctional facilities and their communities daily, they might be an important source of virus introduction into facilities.\u201d The report called for regular screening of staff members and those who enter jails and prisons. But researchers noted that infected people can show no symptoms, suggesting \u201csymptom screening alone is inadequate to promptly identify and isolate infected persons in congregate settings such as correctional and detention facilities.\u201d Physical distancing, movement restrictions, face coverings and increased cleaning are all recommended, the report said. It also noted that some jurisdictions have implemented \u201cdecompression strategies\u201d to reduce crowding in jails and prisons \u2013 reducing or eliminating bail, for example, and releasing people to home confinement or community supervision. The researchers behind the report emphasized that they could be underestimating infections. Only 69% of jurisdictions reported data, they said, so \u201cthese results are not representative of the entire United States.\u201d Many facilities also don\u2019t test staff members, so they rely on workers self-reporting their diagnoses, the report said. And some health departments only received data from state prisons \u2013 missing information from local jails and federal or privately operated facilities. Differences in testing between states also could have influenced the number of reported cases, researchers said. \u00a0 New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is signing an executive order to extend the state's public health emergency for another 30 days. \u201cTo be clear: this does not mean we\u2019re seeing anything in the data which would pause our path forward. These declarations, unless extended, expire after 30 days. We\u2019re still in a public health emergency,\u201d Murphy tweeted.\u00a0 \u201cIf it signals one thing \u2014 it is this, we can\u2019t give up one bit on the one thing we know that is working in this fight: social distancing,\u201d Murphy said Wednesday. By the numbers: New Jersey reported 1,513 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the statewide total to 131,890. The governor cautioned to keep in mind that this is a cumulative total \u2014\u00a0and that more than 90,000 New Jersey residents have \u201cexited the two-week window\u201d and recovered. The state also reported 308 new deaths, bringing the total to 8,549. ##Reopening## The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it has signed a contract with manufacturer 3M to boost N95 medical masks to 26 million per month, starting in October. \u201cThe Department of Defense, in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services, has signed a $126 million contract award with 3M for the increased production of 26 million N95 medical-grade masks per month, starting in October 2020,\" Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Mike Andrews said in a statement. \"This increased production/industrial capacity will continue to ensure a sustainable supply chain of N95 respirators and resupply the Strategic National Stockpile in response to the increased national demand caused by the COVID 19 pandemic,\" the statement added. The Pentagon said that in order to meet the increased production capacity targets 3M \"will expand its facility in Aberdeen, S.D., and also perform initial production in Wisconsin.\" \u00a0 The University of Tennessee announced on Wednesday that they will be bringing students back to their campuses starting in the fall, according to a statement from the university.\u00a0 The Covid-19 pandemic forced UT to move from in-person classes to online learning in mid-March.\u00a0 Those returning to campus this fall will see enhanced safety procedures including social distancing norms as the university works to protect\u00a0the health and safety of all students and employees, the statement said.\u00a0 The UT system has campuses in Memphis, Chattanooga, Knoxville, Martin and Tullahoma. ##Reopening## Businesses and facilities like skate parks, tennis courts, ball fields, trail networks, and golf courses are allowed to reopen, said Vermont Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore. \u201cAs Vermont\u2019s winter transforms into a bright and green spring, many of us, myself included, are itching to get outside and go a bit further afield,\u201d Moore said. Residents are no longer being asked to stay within 10 miles of their homes, she said. However, Gov. Phil Scott said anyone who crosses the border is still required to quarantine for 14 days. ##Reopening## Wendy's expects the beef shortage that's affecting about 1,000 of its US restaurants to continue for the foreseeable future.\u00a0 CEO Todd Penegor said on an earnings call today that Wendy's will probably experience a \"couple of weeks of challenging tightness that we'll have to work through\" before getting back to normal. Yesterday, Wendy's said some of its menu items might be \"temporarily limited at some restaurants\" because of the national meat shortage. Though its delivery schedule remains unchanged, supply has been tight because beef suppliers across North America face production challenges during the pandemic. Analysts at financial firm Stephens scoured the online menus of Wendy's 5,500 US restaurants and found that one in five are not selling hamburgers or other beef items. Instead they're highlighting chicken sandwiches.\u00a0 Penegor acknowledged that certain items will be removed from menus from \"time to time\" during the shortage. \"We do believe it is temporary, and we're close with our big supply partners,\" he added. \"We have several of them on the fresh beef front, and we do believe we'll work through this in short order.\" He also noted that while some restaurants aren't displaying beef on their online menus, it doesn't necessarily mean the restaurant is completely out of beef. Restaurants have the ability to customize their menus, and some have chosen not to display beef items to prevent dissatisfaction since supplies are low.\u00a0 \"It doesn't mean you're out of beef at the restaurant level, but you wouldn't want to really disappoint a consumer if they looked in mobile order and said you had beef, and then they drove to the restaurant and you are out,\" he said.\u00a0 It's \"hard to quantify\" the material impact the shortage might have on Wendy's profits, Penegor added, because customers could be buying other menu items instead.\u00a0 Still, Wendy's stock soared more than 6% in trading today after revealing that US same-store sales have been rebounding every week since hitting a low the first week of April. The company also said that its newly launched breakfast menu is exceeding expectations.\u00a0 ##Food Supply## Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signaled Wednesday that the three south Florida counties who were exempt from phase one of his reopening plan could reopen soon. \u201cWe'll hopefully be able to go forward soon in southern Florida,\u201d DeSantis said during a press conference in Miami Gardens. DeSantis said he has been looking at the trends and even though the Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties are not quite ready yet, he is optimistic that the region will be ready soon.\u00a0 Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez echoed the governor\u2019s tone, saying the county wants to open up as fast as possible while being as safe as possible. \u201cThe governor already expressed some of the good news of the state of Florida. There are similar results here in Miami-Dade County. We have less than 100 people that are respirators today in Miami-Dade County,\u201d Gimenez said. \u201cWe're formulating plans for how we can open up the economy here in Miami-Dade, and now of course that'll be given to the governor so we get his blessing, before we make any announcements.\u201d \u00a0##Reopening## Jet Blue will give a pair of roundtrip flights to 100,000 medical professionals around the country, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. The airline is beginning with 10,000 workers from New York, he said. Jet Blue is offering flights to medical workers to honor their efforts in battling coronavirus, Cuomo said. Dr. Caitlin Rivers, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said to her knowledge, no state has met all the criteria laid out by the White House Task Force for reopening.\u00a0 Speaking at the House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the United States' coronavirus response today, Rivers described the four criteria: The number of new cases must decline for at least two weeks (She said \"some states have met that criteria\" but not the other benchmarks).\nThe state must have enough public health capacity to conduct contact tracing on all new cases.\nThere must be enough diagnostic testing to test everybody with symptoms.\nThere must be enough health care system capacity to treat everyone. \u201cTo my knowledge, there are no states that meet all four of those criteria,\u201d Rivers said.\u00a0 President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, Dr. Tom Frieden said \u201copen versus closed is not a strict on-off switch.\u201d \u201cThere are things that might be first to open: out of doors is way less risky than inside, low-risk businesses, take out from restaurants, outdoor recreation, even daycare if done very carefully and safely maybe lower risk,\u201d Frieden added.\u00a0 ##Reopening## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo just announced preliminary results of a survey of new hospitalized coronavirus patients across the state. Many of the patients.... Were not working or traveling\u00a0\nAre predominantly from downstate\nAre predominantly minorities\u00a0\nAre predominantly older (that means 51 years old and older)\nAre predominantly nonessential employees\nWere predominantly at home at the time of infection (either working from home or not working)\u00a0 \"Much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself \u2026 it comes down to personal behavior,\" Cuomo said, reiterating the importance of wearing a face covering, using hand sanitizer and social distancing \u2013 especially from vulnerable people and populations.\u00a0 The initial results are drawn from surveys of approximately 1,000 patients from around 100 hospitals across the state over three days, he said. Watch: ##New York## New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today that the state's \"total hospitalization rate\u00a0is down again\" today but added he would like to see a \"steeper, faster decline.\" \"We would have liked to see a\u00a0steeper, faster decline, but\u00a0this is where we are, and it's a\u00a0painfully slow decline.\u00a0But it's better than the numbers\u00a0going the other way,\" Cuomo said. ##New York## At least 232 people died across New York from coronavirus yesterday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference.  At least 207 of them died in hospitals and 25 died in nursing homes, Cuomo said. That's up slightly from the 230 people who died on Monday and the 226 who died on Sunday. \"When people talk about how good things are going, and the decline and the progress, that's all true. It's also true that 232 people were lost yesterday,\": Cuomo said. He cautioned that the death totals may be \"worse\" when the final numbers are tallied. At home deaths may not be documented and the virus may have caused some deaths earlier than reported, Cuomo said. Watch: ##New York## After all the back and forth on the White House coronavirus task force\u2019s future, its members are unsure what's happening with the panel, according to a source close to the task force.  They have not been told what will happen next, this person said.\u00a0 Later today there is a closed-door task force meeting on the schedule, according to the Vice President's schedule.\u00a0 Some context: This all comes after President Trump\u00a0appeared to reverse course this morning on the decision to wind down the task force. He tweeted Wednesday that the task force will \u201ccontinue on indefinitely\u201d and shift its focus to \u201cSAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.\u201d Under a new bill introduced in Congress, health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic would have some of their student loan debt forgiven. The \"Student Loan Forgiveness for Frontline Health Workers Act,\" was introduced by New York Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney on Tuesday.  It would create a program that forgives federal and private loans obtained \"to receive medical and professional training held by health care workers who have made significant contributions to Covid-19 patient care, medical research, testing and enhancing the capacity of the health care system to respond to this urgent crisis,\" according to a\u00a0release\u00a0from her office.\u00a0 Maloney said there is an \"obligation to ensure that they are relieved of the debt they incurred to train for this critical work.\" Some context:\u00a0The legislation comes as the surge in coronavirus cases continues to\u00a0strain the medical industry, putting pressure on health care workers who are in need of not only supplies, but additional staff on all fronts to combat the virus. In March, Congress suspended payments and waived interest on federal student loans for six months Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, laid out \u201c10 plain truths\u201d about Covid-19 today as he spoke at a House Appropriations Committee hearing on the pandemic response.\u00a0 \u201cIn my 30 years in global public health, I've never seen anything like this. It's scary. It's unprecedented,\u201d Frieden, who now serves as president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, said.  Here are the 10 truths: \u201cIt's really bad\u201d\u00a0in New York City, Frieden said. \u201cEven now with deaths decreasing substantially, there are twice as many deaths from Covid in New York City as there are on a usual day from all other causes combined.\u201d\nAs bad as this has been, it's \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d\nData is a \u201cvery powerful weapon against this virus,\u201d and using it to monitor trends can help stop clusters before turning into outbreaks, and help stop outbreaks from turning into epidemics.\nAfter flattening the curve, we need to \u201cbox the virus in,\u201d Frieden said.\nWe must find the balance between restarting our economy and letting the virus run rampant.\n\u201cWe must protect the health care workers and other essential staff, or the frontline heroes of this war,\u201d Frieden said.\nWe must protect our most vulnerable people.\nGovernments and private companies need to work together and make \u201cmassive continued investments in testing and distributing a vaccine as soon as possible.\u201d\nWe must not neglect non-Covid health issues.\nPreparedness is paramount. \u201cNever again,\u201d Frieden said.\u00a0\u201cIt is inevitable that there will be future outbreaks. It's not inevitable that we will continue to be so underprepared.\u201d While Southwest Airlines Chairman and CEO Gary Kelly said he remains confident that his company will weather the coronavirus pandemic, he also said the company is planning for worst-case scenarios. \u00a0 \u201cIf it doesn't improve from here,\u00a0we would have to\u00a0dramatically downsize,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow. \u201c\u2026We're obviously working hard to make sure\u00a0that that doesn't happen, but we'll have to have\u2026a scenario that covers that.\u201d\u00a0 Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway revealed in April that it sold its entire stakes in the four airline stocks that the company had owned, including Southwest. \u201cI think the business travel will\u00a0be very slow to recover, I think\u00a0international travel will be\u00a0hampered.\u00a0So we\u2019ve got low costs, we\u2019ve got a\u00a0strong balance sheet, we\u2019ve got\u00a0plenty of cash. And we\u00a0survived 9/11, we survived the\u00a0Great Recession, so I think we'll be well-prepared to compete in this\u00a0type of a scenario,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow in response to Buffett\u2019s actions.\u00a0 Southwest accepted a $2.3 billion grant and a low-interest loan of $948 million from the US Treasury and posted its first operating loss in 11 years at the end of April.  Kelly also highlighted the safety measures being put into place on its planes, including deep cleaning, disinfectant misting and employee shields. Southwest will require passengers to wear face masks starting next week.\u00a0 Watch more: Rep. Rosa DeLauro, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, decried the White House\u2019s decision to block Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the administration's coronavirus task force, from testifying in today\u2019s hearing on the country\u2019s response to Covid-19.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a bipartisan panel,\u201d DeLauro said at the beginning of the hearing. \u201cDr. Fauci has appeared before our subcommittee dozens of times.\u201d DeLauro added that the Trump administration is \"leaving no doubt it is just frightened of oversight.\u201d  You can watch the hearing live here. More context: Yesterday Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0the Democratic-led House is \u201ca bunch of Trump-haters\" as he departed the White House for Arizona for a tour of a Honeywell plant. Fauci is set to\u00a0testify\u00a0May 12 before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The New York fire department announced today that it is adding 100 ambulances to its fleets due \"to the dramatic increase in call volume during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"  \"The ambulances have arrived in New York City, and will be deployed into service as EMTs and paramedics continue to respond to New Yorkers in need. The COVID-19 pandemic has been the busiest period in the history of EMS, with call volume increasing by 50% daily at the height of the pandemic.\u201d The additional ambulances have been leased from companies in South Carolina and Florida, the department said. A day after Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings warned investors that it could be forced to go out of business, the company announced it is \u201cwell-positioned to weather Covid-19 impacts.\u201d In a statement the company reports that it has raised more than $2 billion, including \u201c(1)\u00a0$400 million\u00a0public offering of common equity, (2)\u00a0$750 million\u00a0exchangeable senior notes offering, (3)\u00a0$675 million\u00a0senior secured notes offering and (4)\u00a0$400 million\u00a0private investment from global consumer-focused private equity firm\u00a0L\u00a0Catterton.\u201d\u00a0 According to Norwegian the raised cash will allow them to withstand more than a year of suspended cruises. \u201cThis significantly strengthens the Company\u2019s financial position and liquidity runway and it now expects to be positioned to withstand well over 12 months of voyage suspensions in a potential downside scenario,\u201d Norwegian wrote in a statement. US stocks kicked off higher on Wednesday, on track for their third-straight day of gains. Investors remain confident as parts of the US economy begin to reopen. Stocks continue to shrug off America's massive unemployment numbers. Wednesday\u2019s ADP National Employment Report showed private-sector payrolls collapsed by 20.2 million last month. That previewed Friday\u2019s jobs report, which is expected to show record job losses in April. Here's how the markets opened: The Dow opened 0.7%, or 155 points, higher.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.7%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite opened up 0.8%. ##Economy## Due to economic uncertainty from Covid-19, ridesharing giant Uber says it will reduce its staff by 3,700 employees,\u00a0according to an SEC filing. That amounts to roughly 14% of Uber\u2019s workforce\u00a0and is limited to the company\u2019s customer support and recruiting teams. The company also estimates that it will incur approximately $20 million related to severance and other termination benefits. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi also agreed to waive his base salary for the remainder of the year ending on December 31, according to the filing. ##Economy## President Trump appeared to reverse course on the decision to wind down the coronavirus task force, instead rebranding it. He tweeted today that the task force will \u201ccontinue on indefinitely\u201d and shift its focus to \u201cSAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.\u201d Trump touted his administration\u2019s success in procuring personal protective equipment and testing, even though many experts say there is not nearly enough testing available. \u00a0He also said that task force members may be added or subtracted \u201cas appropriate\u201d and will \u201calso be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics.\u201d Here are his full tweets: Some background: A senior White House official told CNN the\u00a0task force will start to wind down\u00a0later this month. And Vice President Mike Pence confirmed to reporters the White House is considering disbanding the coronavirus task force as early as Memorial Day. \"We're having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level,\" Pence said, noting that the White House has begun to discuss a \"transition plan with FEMA.\" \u00a0 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that some people were out in crowds celebrating Cinco de Mayo in the city yesterday. \u201cThe governor made it very clear\u00a0he's not willing to allow local\u00a0cities to tweak his order,\u201d she said in an interview with CNN\u2019s John Berman, following Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s loosening of coronavirus restrictions. \u201c\u2026We will continue to ask people\u00a0to please stay home.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI feel like a broken record \u2026 We have to say it\u00a0repeatedly,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Bottoms said that enforcing proper social distance strains the city\u2019s resources and law enforcement.\u00a0 \u201cOn top of that, now having to break up crowds and\u00a0remind people to socially\u00a0distance puts our personnel in\u00a0danger, and it continues to\u00a0stretch our resources.\u00a0But it\u2019s where we are and it\u2019s what\u00a0we have to do, and I hope that\u00a0responsible people will continue\u00a0to stay home and have regard for\u00a0the lives of others,\u201d she said.\u00a0 The mayor added that the city and country need to keep assessing the racial disparities seen with coronavirus. \u201cI think the other\u00a0layers that we have to continue\u00a0to address are the health\u00a0disparities and the living\u00a0conditions that are making black\u00a0and brown communities more\u00a0susceptible,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Watch more: ##Reopening## For the first time in its history, New York City deliberately shut down its entire subway system early this morning. The reason: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) deep cleaned to avoid spread of the coronavirus. \"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,\" MTA Chairman Patrick Foye said.\u00a0 The New York City subway been shut down because of weather: Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. During the blizzard of 2015, the system canceled passenger service but equipment trains kept running.\u00a0But this is the first planned shutdown.\u00a0 The cleanings will now be done on a nightly basis, from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.  This is critical to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers,\" said Foye. Subway officials warned New York residents there may be hiccups in executing the unprecedented closure.\u00a0 Subway ridership during the coronavirus crisis is down 90% from pre-pandemic times. But about 11,000 people still have used the subway from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. daily during the pandemic. More than 80 MTA employees, including at least 50 who worked in the subway, have died from complications related to coronavirus.

ADP has been reporting private-sector payrolls each month since 2002. The losses were broad-based across small-, medium- and large-sized businesses as the coronavirus pandemic swept across the country and forced companies to shut down. The services sector was hit the hardest: 16 million service jobs were lost last month. \u201cJob losses of this scale are unprecedented. The total number of job losses for the month of April alone was more than double the total jobs lost during the Great Recession,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute. The ADP report comes two days before the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs report, which is expected to paint an equally bleak picture of the American labor market during the pandemic.\u00a0 ##Economy## By the time the US Department of Agriculture announced a $19 billion aid package on April 17, farmers were already dumping milk and destroying fresh produce as demand from restaurants evaporated. It could be weeks longer before any of the money, most of which was appropriated by Congress in March as part of its $2.2 trillion economic stimulus package, gets to the farmers who need it. USDA is working as quickly as possible to implement the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program,\" a spokesperson said in an email to CNN. What's more, family farmers likely missed out on getting loans from the small business program because it was unclear at first whether agricultural producers qualified.  The USDA is using the $3 billion in aid purchases to address that problem. It is partnering with private distributors who will buy a variety of food and package it into boxes that it will deliver to food banks. The USDA says it will spend $100 million a month on fruit and vegetables, $100 million on dairy products, and a $100 million on meat products.  In the meantime, states have tried to step in. Florida has created a system to help connect farmers directly with buyers, consumers, and food banks. Iowa and Minnesota have launched programs to connect pork producers with local processors as bigger plants shut down because their workers are getting sick.

The Washington state governor, who ran for the Democratic nomination for president last year, criticized the Trump administration for not widely invoking the Defense Production Act, which gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production. Inslee said that Washington and other states have been forced into \"scrambling around the world\" to purchase PPE, \"because the\u00a0the federal government would not accept the responsibility to help purchase this material. And most importantly they would not help to manufacture it.\" Some background: The wartime-era law has been a point of contention between states and the Trump administration. While President Trump has invoked the law in some instances\u00a0during the coronavirus pandemic, the shortage of critically needed supplies has fueled calls to use the law in its full capacity. \"There was only one person in the United States who can do that. That is the president of the United States. Governors cannot do that,\" Inslee said. \"We do not have authority to do that. So we've had to rely on the president making this decision and as I've indicated, he refused to do so for weeks and weeks.\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized President Trump for \u201cturning his back\u201d on the country's largest city because of partisan affiliation. According to de Blasio, the city has lost $7.4 billion, and there is no guarantee of financial help from the federal government.\u00a0 \u201cIt's astounding that [Trump]\u00a0even introduces the question of\u00a0red states and blue states.\u00a0He's saying it out loud.\u00a0He's politicizing a pandemic.\u00a0Not being patriotic, not talking\u00a0about all Americans and how to\u00a0bring us back together,\u201d de Blasio said in an interview with CNN\u2019s John Berman.\u00a0 De Blasio called for a fourth federal stimulus package to provide funding to cities and states.  \u201cWhat we need is a stimulus that\u00a0puts us all back on our feet so\u00a0we can succeed together,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201c\u2026\u00a0If there is not a strong fourth\u00a0stimulus for cities and state,\u00a0there will not be a national\u00a0economic recovery, period.\u201d If he doesn\u2019t get it, the mayor said he could be forced to furlough or lay off people who have been at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic recovery \u2014 first responders, police, firefighters and teachers.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve lost $7.4 billion already\u00a0and my economy can't come back\u00a0until I get that stimulus and\u00a0get back to normal and provide\u00a0the basic services.\u00a0It's a Catch-22.\u00a0No stimulus, no recovery,\u201d de Blasio said.\u00a0 If the President announced that the country needs a fourth stimulus to help fund cities and states, de Blasio said, the Senate would fall in line and work on it immediately.\u00a0 While de Blasio also said he wants to see New York City kids back in school in September, the city is is no place yet to let up on social distancing guidelines yet. \u201cWe're still not there yet to\u00a0even begin to loosen up the\u00a0restrictions,\u201d he said.\u00a0 De Blasio warned the rest of the country to continue to be vigilant. \u201cRight now, what I fear is there's\u00a0a rush to reopen \u2014 in some places\u00a0at least \u2014 that's going to end up\u00a0with people losing their lives\u00a0who didn't have to lose their\u00a0lives,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Watch more: ##New York## Calvin Munerlyn, the security guard who was shot and killed in Michigan last week, was \"loved everywhere,\" his widow told CNN.\u00a0 \"He was devoted, loving, kind-hearted, courageous, brave, just committed,\" she said. \"He was just loved everywhere,\" Munerlyn's widow, Latryna Munerlyn, told CNN's Don Lemon. The 43-year-old guard was shot in the head after telling a customer at a Family Dollar store to wear a face mask -- which the state has mandated for all retail employees and customers, police say. He died at a Flint hospital. Three members of the same family have been charged. That was senseless and stupid. And now my babies (are) without a father for the rest of their life,\" Latryna Munerlyn said. The family had eight children. \"My children are very, very strong,\" she said. \"They are strong, and I say that man instilled something in them that can't nobody take away. My babies are super strong. They have been trying to cope with this and my baby boy said, 'As long as he's with God he's OK.'\" Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said Munerlyn was \"simply doing his job\" to uphold the governor's orders.\u00a0 \"My king always acted honorably,\" Munerlyn's widow said, \"whether he was at that job, a club job, restaurant job, he was an honorable man. Period. They can't take that from him.\" She says even though her husband is now gone, his legacy will \"live on.\" President Donald Trump wants to move on. \"Wartime\" leadership in a national crisis no longer fits his political timetable. No matter that coronavirus cases are rising in many states and that governors are ignoring his guidelines about when it's safe to open. Trump is shrugging off warnings by scientists that the easing of restrictions across the country could cause tens of thousands of deaths.  The White House gave its clearest sign yet Tuesday, just less than six months from Election Day and as the US death toll topped 70,000, that it is moving from pandemic management to a message of revival and an aggressive pitch for a second term. And Trump is thwarting oversight efforts of how he and his administration responded to the pandemic that could reveal failures that worsened the outbreak.\u00a0 Vice President Mike Pence revealed conversations about scaling back the administration's coronavirus task force perhaps around Memorial Day at the end of the month. Officials said that advisers like Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx would remain on board. But closing the task force would make experts whose science-based arguments have sometimes contradicted Trump's overly optimistic projections far less visible. \"We're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening, and we'll have a different group probably set up for that,\" Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta. Trump all but admitted that he was reconciled to the deaths that epidemiologists say would result from a premature effort to open the economy. No one doubts the cataclysmic impact of the stay-at-home orders on the economy -- or the need to somehow find a way to resume daily life, even in some reduced form.  But Trump's White House is showing signs of moving toward the opening in exactly the same slapdash, politically polarizing manner that it used in the early months of the year, when the President was in denial about the problem.

If you're just joining our live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic, here are some key headlines today: At home Trump to disband task force:\u00a0The White House coronavirus task force will begin winding down close to Memorial Day on May 25, according to a senior White House official. This comes just after new models show the US could see 3,000 people die of the virus each day, doubling the death toll to 134,000 by August 4.  \nTrump makes his case: Visiting a plant manufacturing medical masks in Arizona \u2014 a battleground state in the 2020 presidential election \u2014 Trump says he wants to reopen the economy. \nStates may have to close again: More than half of the country's states have started reopening, including many that have not met White House guidelines on when to do so. They may need to shut down again though.\nUS infection forecast:\u00a0Covid-19 will likely infect 60% to 70% of the US population before it slows down, according to a top infectious disease epidemiologist. Michael Osterholm estimates that between 5% and 15% have been infected so far.\nBlack Americans more affected: More black Americans may be dying from coronavirus than white people or other ethnic groups, according to a new study.\u00a0\nDisney's parks are closed: The company's movies aren't in theaters and its cruise ships aren't at sea either. It's one of many companies struggling as the pandemic brings businesses to their knees. Around the world UK resignation:\u00a0Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist who\u00a0advised the UK government on the coronavirus response,\u00a0resigned on Tuesday after the Telegraph newspaper reported he broke lockdown rules by allowing a woman to visit his home.\nGermany lockdown:\u00a0Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss loosening lockdown measures with the 16 state prime ministers today.\n\u00a0Economic pain of \"historic proportions\": The European Union is forecast to contract by a record 7.5% this year, according to a new forecast from the European Commission, as the coronavirus batters economies around the world. \nBack to school:\u00a0Nearly 58,000 students returned to school today in\u00a0Wuhan, China, the original epicenter of the outbreak. Wuhan began lifting restrictions in early April, after more than two months of total lockdown.\nInfection slowdown:\u00a0South Korea and mainland China both recorded no new local transmissions yesterday.\nIn Japan:\u00a0New guidelines for social distancing are provoking\u00a0public backlash. The suggestions include mandatory face masks and outdoor dining at restaurants.\nNew findings:\u00a0A genetic analysis found that the virus' jump from animals to humans was \"very recent,\" and ruled out the possibility that it had been infecting people long before it was identified. Editor's note: Jeffrey D. Sachs is a professor and director of the\u00a0Center for Sustainable Development\u00a0at Columbia University. The opinions expressed here are his own. The big lie of the Trump administration is that China is the cause of America's problems. The meme has worked for a while, since it plays into American smugness that if China is succeeding, they must be cheating. Trump and his right-wing allies upped this game recently by claiming the Covid-19 pandemic was the result of an accidental release from a Chinese laboratory and that China's \"cover up\" blocked an effective global response. According to CNN, the still-secret findings of the Five Eyes intelligence agencies (the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) pour cold water on this claim. So too does Trump's top infectious disease expert,\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci. Yet just this past Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0asserted, \"There is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\" Such charges by the Trump administration and by\u00a0Sen. Tom Cotton\u00a0of Arkansas are reckless and dangerous. They could push the world to conflict just as the Bush administration's lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq pushed the US into war in 2003. Read the full opinion here: With more than\u00a0half the United States now into at least the first stage of reopening, one expert says the country still hasn't done enough to protect residents from the coronavirus. \"I don't think you can say, how much suffering are you willing to bear in order to restart the economy until you have done everything possible to ensure that every single person in America can take measures to protect their own health, the health of their families and the health of their communities,\" Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday. \"That's just not the case right now.\" Governors across the country have allowed residents\u00a0to return to some semblance of normality after weeks of shutdowns to stop the spread of the virus. But the\u00a0country's death toll continues to rise and public health experts have warned relaxing restrictions could cost thousands of lives. \"We don't have the testing capacity now to know where this disease is,\" Besser said. \"We have not scaled up the thousands and thousands of contact tracers that we need, we don't provide safe places for people to isolate or quarantine if they are identified as either having an infection or being in contact. We are saying, if you have money and you are white, you can do well here,\" he said. \"If you are not, good luck to you.\" Read the full story here. ##Reopening## At least\u00a01,204,475\u00a0cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the US, including\u00a071,078\u00a0deaths, according to\u00a0Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases.\u00a0 The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases. CNN is tracking US coronavirus cases here: The coronavirus pandemic has left touring musicians and the venues they visit shut out of their primary source of income for a future with no end in sight. Luckily, Bandcamp has thrown them a lifeline with a campaign aimed at helping them get through these difficult times. The online music marketplace waived its revenue share in two artist-focused campaigns over the past several weeks that have\u00a0raised a combined $11.4 million\u00a0for artists. \"We decided to waive our revenue share to help raise awareness about the importance of supporting artists impacted by the pandemic and get some much-needed funds into artists' pockets,\" Bandcamp CEO Ethan Diamond told CNN. \"Musicians have been hit especially hard by the pandemic, with tours and shows canceled for the foreseeable future, and with such a major revenue stream drying up entirely overnight, we knew that supporting artists in the coming months would be an urgent priority for anyone who cares about music and the artists who create it.\" Fans buying music and merchandise through Bandcamp will help many artists to do simple things such as pay their rent and buy food and other essentials, the company said. And payments are processed within 24-48 hours, meaning there are fewer middlemen to deal with before getting paid. A new genetic analysis\u00a0of the virus that causes\u00a0Covid-19 taken from more than 7,600 patients around the world shows the virus has been circulating in people since late last year, and must have spread extremely quickly after the first infection. Researchers in Britain looked at mutations in the virus and found evidence of rapid spreading, but no evidence the virus is becoming more easily transmitted or more likely to cause serious disease. \u201cThe virus is changing, but this in itself does not mean it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d genetics researcher Francois Balloux of the University College London Genetics Institute told CNN. Balloux and colleagues pulled viral sequences from a giant global database that scientists around the world are using to share data. They looked at samples taken at different times and from different places, and said they indicate that the virus first started infecting people at the end of last year. \u201cThis rules out any scenario that assumes SARSCoV-2 may have been in circulation long before it was identified, and hence have already infected large proportions of the population,\u201d Balloux\u2019s team wrote in their report, published in the journal\u00a0Infection, Genetics and Evolution.\u00a0 \u201cOur results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host,\u201d the team wrote in the report, published Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very recent,\u201d Balloux said. \u201cWe are really, really, really confident that the host jump happened late last year.\u201d They also found genetic evidence that supports suspicions the virus was infecting people in Europe, the US and elsewhere weeks or even months before the first official cases were reported in January and February. Balloux\u2019s team had their findings reviewed by other experts, a process called peer review, before they were published in the journal. He said some reports by other teams, published online in on what are called pre-print websites, may have drawn incorrect conclusions. \u201cAll viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected. So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious,\u201d Balloux said. Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, may allow other companies to produce the investigational drug for Europe, Asia and elsewhere \u2013 at least for the next two years. In a statement released Tuesday, the California-based company said it was in discussions with chemical and pharmaceutical companies \u201cabout their ability, under voluntary licenses, to produce remdesivir for Europe, Asia and the developing world through at least 2022.\u201d Gilead also said it was negotiating long-term licenses with several generic drugmakers in India and Pakistan to produce remdesivir for developing countries. The company is also in discussions with the Medicines Patent Pool, an international organization that has worked with Gilead in the past to coordinate licenses for low and middle-income countries. In early results from a trial sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health, remdesivir was found to shorten the duration of illness in patients with severe Covid-19, but it had no statistically significant effect on whether patients died.\u00a0 Voluntary licenses would allow other drugmakers to produce remdesivir as if it were a generic, and the move could prevent governments from forcing so-called compulsory licenses for the well-patented medication. It\u2019s unclear what payment or royalties Gilead would require, if any, under the licenses. CNN has reached out for comment. Gilead itself currently has about 1.5 million vials of the drug on hand, which amounts to between 100,000 and 200,000 treatment courses, depending on how long patients take it. The company has set a goal of producing 1 million treatment courses by December."], "Language": false}
