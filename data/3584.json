Selection Process 68 teams are invited to compete.\n- 32 teams receive automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments.\n- 36 teams receive an at-large bid from the NCAA Selection Committee. The 10-member selection committee, comprised of athletic directors and conference commissioners, is responsible for selecting the 36 at-large teams, seeding (or ranking) all 68 teams and placing them in one of four regions within the bracket. The committee's field of 68 is revealed on the Sunday before the four first-round games, appropriately dubbed \"Selection Sunday.\" The selection process is based on many factors including win-loss record, strength of schedule and NET (NCAA Evaluation Tool) data. Other Facts The single-elimination tournament is nicknamed \"March Madness\" or \"The Big Dance.\" The \"First Four\" are the four opening round games. Two games match number 16 seeds against each other, and the other two games feature the last four at-large teams selected into the tournament. The winners advance to the next round, the round of 64. Each of the four regions consists of 16 teams that are seeded No. 1 to No. 16. In the first round, teams are paired according to seed. The No. 1 seed faces No. 16, No. 2 faces No. 15, No. 3 faces No. 14, and so forth. The winning teams advance to the second round.   The 16 teams that advance beyond their first and second-round games are referred to as the \"Sweet Sixteen.\" The remaining eight teams are called the \"Elite Eight,\" and the last four teams are the \"Final Four.\" An underdog or lower-seeded team that advances throughout the tournament is often referred to as a \"Cinderella\" team.
