Bieber was the musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live,\" where he performed alongside Quavo of Migos. Hosting the show was none other than drag diva RuPaul. The Canadian singer's first performance of the evening was \"Yummy,\" which he released in January. Bieber wore a simple black T-shirt and baggy green pants that matched the stage backdrop. The simple performance focused on his soft vocals and well-rehearsed dance moves. Bieber later took the stage to perform his newest release \"Intentions,\" which featured a guest performance by Quavo. The song and its music video dropped on Thursday ahead of SNL, and the tune is a lot more emotional than you'd think. Although the lyrics to \"Intentions\" have all the markings of a love song, Bieber used it to show love for the Los Angeles-based charity Alexandria House, which offers housing for women and children transitioning out of shelters. In the music video, Bieber and Quavo spotlight the stories of a struggling student, a foster care advocate and a poet inspired by her homelessness. Bieber's fifth studio album \"Changes\" is set to be released on February 14. Yes, Valentine's Day."], "Language": false}
