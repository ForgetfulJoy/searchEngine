Pictured here: British diver Tracey Miles silhouetted against the city's famous skyline. Disused spots: Other cities have more complex Olympic legacies -- Athens hosted the Games in 2004, but some of the venues are now abandoned. Nature takes over: In China, some of Beijing's 2008 Olympic venues have been overrun by nature. Ongoing project: The International Olympic Committee is currently conducting a study looking at the post-Games use of all current Olympic venues, including Athens, pictured here.
