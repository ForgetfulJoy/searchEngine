CNN's global town hall on the coronavirus has now concluded. Guests on the show, hosted by Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta, included medical experts, former US Vice President Al Gore and director Spike Lee. Scroll through our posts to catch up on what happened during the town hall. Former US Vice President Al Gore slammed the White House's practice of distributing much\u00a0of the administration's scientific knowledge on coronavirus through the coronavirus task force and the vice president's office. \"It makes no sense at all,\" said Gore, speaking at CNN's global town hall. \"We have had a tradition in this country of seeking out the best available evidence and testing it with one another in free discourse, and then deciding together in the spirit of camaraderie what is more likely to be true than not. \n\"That is how science works as well,\" he said. Gore also criticized the administration for blocking Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the coronavirus task force, from testifying before the Democratic-led House. \"For the the White House to prevent him from testifying to the House ... on hearings that the American people want to see ... that's horrible,\" he said.  Former US Vice President Al Gore said that President Donald Trump and his administration have failed to properly handle the Covid-19 pandemic. \"He has failed as\u00a0president.\u00a0Particularly on this challenge.\u00a0The warnings were ignored,\" Gore said during CNN's global town hall. Gore said when he was vice president, he began every day with a report from the intelligence community and:  \"There were very few occasions\u00a0where there was a stark warning\u00a0about grave danger to the\u00a0country, and whenever there was such an\u00a0occasion, we stopped and said\u00a0hold the show.\u00a0Get the FBI, get the CIA, get\u00a0whoever was involved over, we\u00a0need to learn about this,\" Gore explained.  Gore said he believes Trump both missed the warnings and \"failed to mobilize\u00a0the resources of the federal\u00a0government to straighten out\u00a0this testing catastrophe,\u00a0to get swabs, and the so-called\u00a0re-agents they need to do the\u00a0tests, and the gowns, and masks,\u00a0and all of the other stuff.\" Reopening too soon: Gore also said he's concerned the country is not ready to reopen. \"I think we are seeing the start of a botched reopening,\" he said.  Trump, Gore said, \"may be recklessly rolling the dice hoping that he can goose the economy just enough in the third quarter of this year to enhance his reelection prospects, hoping that he can divert the blame for the extra tens of thousands of Americans who the doctors tell us will die as a result of this, and blame it on the Chinese or former President Obama or whoever, instead of doing what a president needs to do.\" Watch: ##Daily Life## We won't be able to go back to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic ends, warned Laurie Garrett, a Pulitzer-prize winning public health journalist, speaking on CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall. \"I think we're\u00a0going to get four, five years from now and there will not be a\u00a0single aspect of our lives\u00a0that's been unchanged,\" she said. \"It's almost impossible to really\u00a0fully envision what that will\u00a0look like.\" Garrett said aspects of our lives likely to change include our mode of travel, especially by air. We may reconsider whether it's necessary to go to events and meetings that involve human contact, and adopt alternatives instead. \"All sorts of interactions and\u00a0behaviors that we've taken for\u00a0granted will look different,\" she said. Then, of course, there are the effects of a recession that will reverberate for years. \"As we get further\u00a0and further into the economic\u00a0repercussions of this\u00a0extraordinary pandemic, we're\u00a0going to see that every single\u00a0aspect of life is affected\u00a0simply by virtue of the\u00a0inability of governments to invest in\u00a0change, the limitations and cash\u00a0reserves for companies, and how\u00a0they're going to approach their\u00a0own innovations and developments\u00a0going down the road,\" she said. ##Daily Life## CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta offered viewers of CNN's global town hall some practical advice on how safely shop for groceries during the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 First, make your visit as brief as possible. \"The key is, plan ahead, plan your list,\" said Gupta, showing off his own shopping list.\u00a0\u00a0 Next, make your visit as short as reasonably possible.\u00a0 \"Get in, get out, as soon as possible,\" said Gupta in a short video demonstrating a visit to his own local store. \"You need to be efficient in the store and think about every surface you might touch. You do not want to dilly-dally.\" Next, try to limit your contact with items you aren't purchasing. \"Think about yourself as a SWAT team member,\" he said. \"Get in, get out, leave as little trace of yourself as possible ... Don't touch anything you are not going to buy. Be very focused.\" Finally,\u00a0Gupta reminded viewers of what's coming up on Sunday. \"Don't forget to buy some flowers for Mother's Day!\" he said.\u00a0 Watch: ##Daily Life## Laurie Garrett, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist who has written about public health for years, said that the global community needs to do a better job in unifying its response to the Covid-19 pandemic in order to get it under control. \"The real problem at the\u00a0moment is we have very\u00a0fragmented responses all over\u00a0the world,\" Garrett, the author of \"The Coming Plague,\" said during CNN's global town hall.  \"Every country is doing its own\u00a0thing. Within countries, every\u00a0state or province is doing its own thing. Every county is doing its own thing. We don't have a unified approach,\" she said. The vaccine race: Garrett said that some countries are simply racing to find a vaccine in an effort to \"buy themselves time and solve their own local problems.\" \"The virus will continue to circulate in the world regardless of whether or not there's a vaccine, unless we're committed to a strategic goal of really getting rid of the virus from the planet with appropriate implementation of a vaccine for everybody, 7.5 billion human beings.\" ##Health## Dr.\u00a0Leana Wen, former Baltimore health commissioner, joined CNN's ongoing town hall to talk about the novel coronavirus pandemic and answer some viewers' questions. What can I do to reduce my own risk? States are reopening but the risk hasn't changed, Wen said. This means people should still follow the official guidance: Wash your hands often, stay home, practice social distancing and avoid gatherings -- and work remotely if it's an option. Wear a mask, and try to avoid public transportation. Is swimming at a lake safer than in a pool? It's not really about what kind of water you're swimming in -- it's your proximity with other people, said Wen. \"If there are other people\u00a0around you and they can breathe\u00a0on you or cough on you and there\u00a0are surfaces that you could be\u00a0touching, then you could get\u00a0coronavirus that way,\" she said. Should I wear gloves to the grocery store? The key thing is to avoid touching your face, with or without gloves on, Wen said. If you wash your hands often, be mindful of the things you touch, and avoid touching your face. You don't necessarily need to wear gloves out, she said. I live near a Tyson Foods plant. If an infected worker there\u00a0is processing meat, can that meat\u00a0become tainted and pass Covid-19\u00a0onto me? No. This is a respiratory virus, said CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"So really the way you're going\u00a0to become infected is if\u00a0someone is putting the virus out\u00a0in the air around you and you\u00a0get exposed that way or touch a\u00a0surface.\u00a0You don't eat this virus and get\u00a0it that way,\" he said. ##Health## Ian Haydon, a 29-year-old living in the Seattle area, joined CNN's global town hall to explain what motivated him to participate in a vaccine trial for the virus. Haydon said he was one of 45 healthy people selected to participate in the phase 1 trial after thousands volunteered. He said he was just trying to do his part to stop the virus' spread. \"My motivation for wanting to\u00a0participate in this trial is\u00a0pretty simple: this is one way\u00a0that I can help out, and\u00a0I'm very fortunate to be in\u00a0good health.\u00a0If stepping up can speed up\u00a0a vaccine, that seems like the right thing to do,\" he said. \n\"The weight of the world is\u00a0on these vaccines right now.\u00a0No one knows if this is going to\u00a0be the one.\u00a0But I think the people involved\u00a0in the study clearly know\u00a0they\u2019re involved with something\u00a0historical here.\" Watch: ##Health## Dr. Deborah\u00a0Birx, a White House coronavirus task force official, hopes that the United States will have conducted more than 8 million tests for the virus before the end of the week. Birx shared this insight on Thursday night during CNN's coronavirus town hall. \"I think I've been very\u00a0encouraged about two parts of\u00a0the testing.\u00a0One, the dramatic increase and\u00a0the number of tests we're doing\u00a0per week.\u00a0We hope this week to get closer,\u00a0over 8 million.\u00a0We're going up.\u00a0We're about 2.5% of all\u00a0Americans having been tested.\u00a0That is increasing by half a\u00a0percent every week so we can get\u00a0close to other countries and\u00a0their 3%,\" Birx said. ##Health## Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said on CNN's global town hall that the Trump administration was still in the editing process regarding a draft recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to  reopen the United States after the coronavirus pandemic. \"We're working with the CDC on a whole series of products,\" she said. \"Those are still being worked on. No one has stopped those guidelines. We're still in editing.\" A senior CDC official told CNN Thursday that the Trump administration would not implement the 17-page recommendation. \"We are used to dealing with a White House that asks for things and then chaos ensues. A team of people at the CDC spent innumerable hours in response to an ask from Debbie Birx,\" the official said.  Birx said that the decision was made not to implement the recommendation because the editing process had not been completed. \"It was more about\u00a0simplification to make sure to\u00a0make sure that American people\u00a0as well as public health officials\u00a0understand the guidelines,\" she said. Birx said that they were also devoting special attention to \"surveillance for asymptomatic individuals.\" \"That was a very new element that we\u00a0really felt very strongly had to be\u00a0included because of the ever-increasing evidence of\u00a0asymptomatic spread,\" she said. Watch: ##Daily Life## ##Business## The novel coronavirus could kill as many as 190,000 people in Africa during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, the World Health Organization warned on Thursday. \u201cWhile Covid-19 likely won\u2019t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smoulder in transmission hotspots,\u201d Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, said in a statement.\n\u201cCovid-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.\u201d\u00a0 The WHO predicted that between 29 million to 44 million Africans could be infected in the first year. As many as 5.5 million of these people could require hospital treatment, a number that would overwhelm the medical capacity of most places on the continent. A survey done in March of health services in Africa found an average of nine intensive care unit beds per 1 million people in 47 African countries.  \u201cThese would be woefully inadequate,\u201d the WHO said. ##Health## A total of 44 US states are expected to partially reopen by Sunday -- nearly the entire country. But the coronavirus crisis isn't getting better everywhere. There are signs of improvement in 16 states -- but the situation is deteriorating in many more ... Things are getting better in states like Montana, New York, and Colorado. In these places, some schools are starting to reopen as new daily cases plateau or drop. But things are getting worse in places like Minnesota and Puerto Rico, where cases were up 50% between last week and the week before. States like Texas and Washington aren't as hard hit, but cases are still increasing by 10% to 50% week-on-week. Only a few states -- like California and Florida -- are holding steady.

The Dalai Lama will hold his first spiritual teaching in mid-May after suspending it in February due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Dalai Lama's office announced on Wednesday that the Tibetan leader will hold public teaching on May 16 and 17, but via\u00a0live webcast. \u201cAt the request of individuals and groups from around the world, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has graciously consented to give a two-day teaching,\" according to the announcement. The\u00a0Dalai\u00a0Lama canceled all his public engagements \u201cuntil further notice\u201d on February 12 after his personal physician and others advised him to due to the coronavirus outbreak. He has not made any public appearances since late January. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader in a statement on Sunday called for a \u201ccoordinated, global response\u201d to fight the pandemic, and urged people to focus on \"what unites us as members of one human family.\" If you're just turning in, here is the latest on the coronavirus pandemic across the globe: Some schools will reopen in France: French students will gradually start returning to schools staring Monday, depending on where they live and their school year, French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said today.\u00a0\nTroops to help long-term care centers: Canada is sending hundreds more troops to long-term care centers in Quebec and Ontario as coronavirus outbreaks contribute to a growing crisis in seniors\u2019 homes.\nRetail stores will reopen in Denmark: The country will begin to open retail stores and shopping centers, the prime minister said today. Professional sports will be allowed to resume without spectators starting Monday.\nBritain's stay-home order: The UK may start lifting stay-at-home restrictions from as early as this Sunday.\nTreatment for Covid-19: Japan has approved the use of the experimental anti-viral drug\u00a0remdesivir, for the treatment of coronavirus patients with severe symptoms. ##Catch Up## Canada is sending hundreds more troops to long-term care centers in Quebec and Ontario as coronavirus outbreaks contribute to a growing crisis in seniors\u2019 homes. Despite efforts to shore up staffing and improve conditions, there are still hundreds of outbreaks at seniors\u2019 centers across Canada with dozens of deaths reported daily.  Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said more than 1,600 soldiers would be deployed by next week, the majority to centers in the Montreal area.  'We're all in and going as quickly as we can,\"\u00a0Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said today during a press conference from Ottawa.  \"This is not a typical Canadian Armed Forces operation,\" Sajjan added, echoing the words of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who last month said soldiers should not be taking care of seniors.  But Trudeau added that for now, Canada has no choice but to do just that as the crisis in seniors\u2019 homes continues.\u00a0Nearly four in every five Canadians who have died of Covid-19 have been residents of long-term care facilities.  Canadian military commanders say they have \u2018stripped\u2019 armed forces bases across the country of military medical personnel.\u00a0They will be supported by other military staffers for logistics and operations requirements.  As of Thursday, Canada has reported about 65,000 cases of the virus and more than 4,500 deaths.  Canada\u2019s top public health official warned this week that deaths would continue to rise even though the epidemic has been slowing in Canada with only hundreds of new cases per day outside of long term care homes.  \u201cWe know that the doubling time is now probably around 20 days so the epidemic itself is decelerating. But unfortunately and tragically what\u2019s happening right now is that those who have been infected are coming to the end of their clinical outcome. With so many long term care facilities affected I think that the number of deaths will continue to increase,\u201d said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s Chief Public Officer.  ##Health## ##Daily Life## French students will gradually start returning to schools staring Monday, depending on where they live and their school year, French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said today.\u00a0 Primary schools will open across the country Monday, with classes limited to 15 students,\u00a0Blanquer said. Middle-school students from regions where the rate of infection is slowing down \u2014 categorized as \u201cgreen\u201d by the French government \u2014 will be returning to school on May 18. But middle schools in areas where the virus is still actively circulating \u2014 categorized as \u201cred\u201d \u2014 will not reopen.\u00a0 High schools will remain closed until at least the beginning of June, the education minister added.\u00a0 Schools \u201ccannot welcome everyone at the same time,\u201d Blanquer said, so some students will be given priority. These include disabled children, children of health care or essential workers, and children who are classed as at risk of dropping out. In some instances children may return next Tuesday to give professors time to prepare. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Denmark will begin to open retail stores and shopping centers as coronavirus restrictions are gradually lifted, the prime minister said today.  Professional sports will be allowed to resume without spectators starting Monday. \"Phase two\" of the government\u2019s plan will see the reopening of restaurants, cafes, bars, libraries, churches, schools and boarding schools for students in grades 6 through 10, from May 18.\u00a0Younger students returned to school last month, during the country's first phase of reopening. All reopenings will take place under strict rules to maintain social distancing and cannot be considered a return to \u201cnormal\u201d life, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said.\u00a0 \"We have to expect more cases as we open society. That is why it is crucial that we protect the\u00a0people that are vulnerable to the\u00a0disease. But there is a risk and that is why we must continue to maintain social distancing,\" the prime minister said. A ban on gatherings of more than 10 people will remain and borders are to stay closed.  The situation in the country is still \u201cserious\u201d and restrictions could be reimposed if there is a spike in cases upon reopening, Frederiksen said. The second phase will continue with ongoing precautions in place: random testing, the use of protective equipment, social distancing, good hygiene, and the avoidance of possible \u201csuper spreading\u201d situations, such as mass gatherings. \u00a0 The number of hospital admissions attributed to coronavirus in Denmark fell below 200 today for the first time in seven weeks. The number of admitted patients have been dropping steadily since peaking with 535 people at the start of April.\u00a0 In Denmark, 514 people have died from the virus. The first phase of reopening began three weeks ago and included school children up through fifth grade, as well as businesses including hairdressers and chiropractors reopening. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Business## If you're just joining us, here is the latest on the coronavirus pandemic across the globe: Trump valet tests positive: A member of the US Navy serving as one of\u00a0President Trump's\u00a0personal valets has tested positive for\u00a0coronavirus, raising concerns about\u00a0the President's possible exposure to the virus.\nBritain's stay-home order: The UK may start lifting stay-at-home restrictions from as early as this Sunday.\nBrazil pushes to reopen: Just one day after Brazil saw a record spike in coronavirus cases, its government is pushing for quarantine measures to be relaxed to save the country's economy from collapse.\nThe situation in China: More than five months after the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic broke out in China, all mainland counties are now at a \u201clow-risk\u201d of the outbreak.

So far\u00a030,615 people have\u00a0died with coronavirus in UK, according to Department of Health and Social Care data. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Just a day after Brazil saw a record spike in coronavirus cases, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said that quarantine measures need to be relaxed or the country's economy could collapse. \u201cA problem that increasingly worries us\u2026 the issue of unemployment, the issue of the economy no longer working. We can\u2019t let the side effect of the fight against the virus be more harmful than the disease itself,\u201d Bolsonaro said during a speech at the Supreme Court today. \u201cWe need to save the economy because the economy is life,\u201d Bolsonaro added. Guedes warned that the economy could be headed toward a \u201ctotal collapse.\u201d  \u201cThe economy is beginning to collapse. We don\u2019t want to turn into a Venezuela,\u201d the Economy minister said. Where the numbers stand: Yesterday, the Health Ministry of Brazil reported that the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country rose by a record 10,503 to 125,218 in 24 hours. The death toll also rose by a record 615 to 8,536. Brazil currently has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Latin America.  Bolsonaro has faced criticism for downplaying the threat of the virus. He has repeatedly attended large political rallies calling for an end to quarantine measures in the country. ##Daily Life## ##Health## ##Business## The Spanish\u00a0capital will reopen some of the\u00a0city's\u00a0parks from tomorrow, Madrid's City Hall said today.\u00a0 Starting Friday, most\u00a0neighborhood\u00a0parks and garden areas\u00a0in\u00a0the city\u00a0will\u00a0be open,\u00a0but playgrounds and exercise areas will remain closed. The city will also\u00a0prohibit vehicles\u00a0on\u00a0some of its major streets this weekend to guarantee\u00a0those going out for\u00a0walks, runs or bicycle rides can maintain social distancing and\u00a0follow\u00a0safety rules.  But the city's most emblematic parks,\u00a0such as El\u00a0Retiro in\u00a0the city center\u00a0and the sprawling Casa de Campo park\u00a0on the east side,\u00a0will remain closed \"to avoid big\u00a0crowds.\"\u00a0The traffic cuts will start Saturday and\u00a0continue\u00a0for several weekends. While\u00a0Spain\u00a0continues to wind down its state of emergency confinement order, the government is\u00a0set\u00a0to\u00a0announce certain regions may advance to the first phase of reopening. But that's only\u00a0if they can show their\u00a0region's infection rates are low and health facilities are able to quickly\u00a0handle\u00a0any new outbreaks. Madrid is one\u00a0of the regions asking the central government to move to Phase 1\u00a0as early as next Monday.\u00a0 Madrid\u2019s Regional Government Vice-President Ignacio Aguado\u00a0told Spanish Radio SER his region is ready and has met the health criteria.\u00a0The region includes the capital city and the surrounding other cities and towns.\u00a0 \"Confinement doesn't kill the virus, it\u00a0stops\u00a0the health services from collapsing.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce the roadmap for Britain's reopening on Sunday, along with conditions needed to reach each new phase. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said\u00a0today the initial changes will be \"modest and incremental\". The government has pledged to review coronavirus restrictions every three weeks, with the next review due today.

The R0 is the average number of other people infected by each patient. The overall number of cases and deaths is steadily falling, Raab said, but he warned the virus is not yet beaten.\u00a0 It remains deadly and infectious,\" Raab noted. \u00a0The UK's coronavirus death toll has\u00a0risen by 539 to reach 30,615.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## ##Health## If you're just turning in, here is the latest on the coronavirus pandemic across the globe: Workers in Africa: Nearly 1,000 health workers are infected with Covid-19 across the continent, according to World Health Organization (WHO) officials.\nFrance's stay-home order: The country will start lifting its stay-at-home restrictions starting on Monday.\nThe situation in China: More than five months after the coronavirus pandemic broke out in China, all mainland counties are now at a \u201clow-risk\u201d of the outbreak, the government said today.

Wearing masks and gloves will be mandatory for those at work, out shopping or on public transport, the mayor said. While the situation in Moscow has \u201cstabilized,\u201d social distancing and other restrictions will also need to remain in place, Sobyanin added. The mayor said that while the number of daily infections recorded in Moscow is still \"quite large,\" this is likely due to an increase in testing and not to an actual increase in the spread of infection.  A more important indicator is that the number of hospitalizations with severe and moderate pneumonia has stopped growing over the past two weeks,\u201d he said. Moscow industrial and construction enterprises will be able to resume work on Tuesday, but only essential employees will report to work. Those who can work remotely will stay home. Regular spot testing for coronavirus will be enforced as well. The mayor said it's still too early to reopen restaurants, theaters, and sports facilities. The Russian government has extended nationwide lockdown measures until next Tuesday. But President Vladimir Putin said some measures may be extended and tightened in locations around the country on a case-by-case basis. ##Daily Life## ##Health## Nearly 1,000 health workers are infected with Covid-19 across the continent, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa says. \u201cWe are very concerned that almost 1,000 African health workers have been infected with Covid-19. We know that most African countries already have a severe shortage of health care workers.\u00a0And when our front line workers fall ill or are absent from work, communities don\u2019t have access to essential services like immunizations, safe deliverers and treatment for chronic and infectious diseases,\u201d Dr. Moeti said today during a briefing.

Those services had been banned for almost two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. A protocol signed today by the Italian government and the conference of Italian bishops will allow public religious celebrations \u201cin conditions of maximum safety for the faithful\u201d. The safety measures provided for in the protocol \"indicate the most suitable ways to ensure that the resumption of religious celebrations takes place in the safest way for public health and for the protection of the faithful,\" Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. Parish priests will identify \"the maximum capacity of the church\" which can guarantee social distancing during masses, the government press office told CNN, The priest and worshipers will have to wear masks. The priest will give communion wearing gloves and must be careful \"avoiding any contact with the faithful\u2019s hands,\" the protocol reads. Churchgoers will also have to maintain a one-meter distance from others, inside and outside the church. Worshippers with a temperature above 37.5 degrees \u2014 of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 will not be admitted. Sanitizing gels will need to be placed at the churches entrance. At the end of every mass, the church and the objects used during the service, as the holy vases, will need to be sanitized. Similar agreements will be signed shortly with other religious groups, Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese said.

The official said changes would likely include allowing Britons to expand their social groups. It was still being discussed how that expansion would be defined.  The UK has the second-highest death toll from the virus in the world following the US. The official was confident that Sunday would see the UK government dropping \u201cstay at home\u201d as a core part of its message. They said shops including hardware stores or garden centers \u2014 mostly outdoor stores \u2014 would probably be allowed to reopen. Pubs, cafes, restaurants and department stores were not expected to reopen for the foreseeable future. Separately, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said the UK will \u201cadvance with maximum caution\u201d when it does begin easing coronavirus restrictions.  \"We will be guided at every step by the science and the data and we will closely track the impact of any easing of the social distancing measures and will not hesitate to tighten the rules if required.\u201d The spokesman added the British Prime Minister wanted to maintain a \u201cfour nation approach,\u201d regarding the lifting of restrictions.  Earlier, Scotland's leader Nicola Sturgeon said it is her \u201cpreference\u201d for all four UK governments to make changes at the same point but if Johnson decides to move at a faster pace she will respect his decision. Johnson's spokesperson said a four-nation approach for England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales provides \"the best way forward.\" \u201cThe four nations entered the restrictions at the same time and should, where it makes sense, exit the restrictions at the same time. We agree that the only circumstances where there should be divergence is when there is evidence that supports it.\u201d\u00a0 The UK economy is heading for its worst crash in more than 300 years because of the pandemic according to a new forecast from the\u00a0Bank of England. The spokesperson acknowledged the toll the current measures were having on the British economy, but reiterated the warning that a second spike would be even more devastating.  ##Daily Life## ##Health## ##Business## The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Sweden is at least 3,040, the country\u2019s Public Health Agency said on Thursday. In total, the country has recorded 24,623 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak began. Sweden has taken a relatively relaxed approach to social distancing rules compared with other European countries. Why Sweden never locked down: Sweden has been an outlier\u00a0during the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak. The country has not joined many of its European neighbors in imposing strict limits on citizens' lives, and images of people heading to work on busy streets, or chatting at cafes and bars have raised eyebrows.  While the country's chief epidemiologist explains why Sweden never locked down and the the country says it's coronavirus approach has worked, the numbers suggest a different story.  ##Health## ##Daily Life##\u00a0 Germany's\u00a0Bundesliga is set to become the first major football league to resume play during the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.

He said Borussia Dortmund versus Schalke 04 are among the first to kick off.\u00a0 Chancellor Angela Merkel set out plans yesterday for the gradual reopening of the country after weeks-long restrictions, including resuming play for the country's top football league. She did not specify if this would be with spectators or behind closed doors. It would be the first major European league to resume playing. Last week, France canceled its season and declared Paris Saint-Germain the winner of Ligue 1. Merkel said authorities would watch local regions to ensure any outbreak was stopped. Germany is widely considered to have responded effectively to the pandemic, thanks in part to its large-scale coronavirus testing capacity. ##Daily Life## ##Health## Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan has announced that his government\u00a0will be begin to lift the nationwide coronavirus lockdown starting on Saturday. \u201cWe have decided to lift the lockdown from Saturday in phases,\u201d Khan said, addressing the nation. \u201cWe are doing this because the people of our country are suffering economically.\u201d  Khan also called\u00a0on the nation to be responsible after the lockdown is lifted and to continue practicing social distancing.  Khan said that while Pakistan's Covid-19 cases continue to rise, he \u201ccan\u2019t say when Pakistan will reach its peak in numbers\u201d and the people of his country cannot continue to suffer economically because of this.\u00a0Khan stressed that Pakistan\u2019s coronavirus death toll hasn't been as high as predicted and that the healthcare system has not been \u201coverwhelmed \u201c as previously feared.\u00a0 \u201cWe haven\u2019t\u00a0reached the kind of peak that Europe has seen, much wealthier nations than us have fared worse than us,\u201d Khan said.  The first phase of reopening will include outpatient departments in hospitals; factories manufacturing pipes, ceramic ware, electric cables, steel and aluminum; as well as shops selling those items. All shops in rural areas will also be reopened.  All reopened retailers will welcome customers from sunrise to 5 p.m. local time five days a week. All educational institutions will continue to remain closed until at least July 15, and all major exams that are due to be held in the summer will be canceled.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the reproduction rate of the virus in the country, known as the \"R-rate,\" is still \u201chovering around 1\u201d. She said easing up now could be \u201cvery risky\u201d.  What that means: A\u00a0reproduction rate\u00a0of one means each person with\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0will infect an average of one other person. Sturgeon said Scotland may be behind other parts of the UK.\u00a0 For us to drop the clear, well understood stay-at-home message right now could be a potentially catastrophic mistake,\" Sturgeon said. She said the measures will be reviewed on a weekly basis and are currently due to end three weeks from now, on May 28.  Responding to British media reports that the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson may announce a change to lockdown measures on Sunday, Sturgeon said she would not agree to a change in messaging around staying at home. She added other suggested changes about encouraging people back to work \u201cwould not in my judgement be safe to make\u201d. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the decisions we take now are a matter of life and death,\u201d she said. During the daily Edinburgh briefing, Sturgeon said she may be prepared to agree with a change of guidance about exercising. British media have reported people across the UK may be allowed to exercise outside more than once daily from Monday.  The First Minister said it is her \u201cpreference\u201d for all four UK governments to make changes at the same point but if Johnson decides to move at a faster pace she will respect his decision. \u201cI will not be pressured into lifting restrictions prematurely before I am certain we will not be risking a resurgence,\u201d Sturgeon said. ##Daily Life## ##Health##\u00a0  UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has thanked Malaysia, Dubai and the UAE for their shipments of personal protective equipment to the UK's National Health Service.  His comments came after it was revealed around 400,000 surgical gowns ordered by the British government from a Turkish company were never distributed among NHS workers because they didn\u2019t meet safety standards. The news that the gowns couldn't be used was an embarrassment for the UK government, who touted the shipment from Turkey as a solution to the country's PPE shortages.  Raab also said: \u201cI would like to thank Dubai and the UAE for their generous donation of\u00a0PPE\u00a0for the fight against Covid-19.

A growing number of children are showing up at New York hospitals with troubling new symptoms that state health officials believe could be\u00a0linked to coronavirus. In an advisory to health care providers, state officials said 64 children in New York have been hospitalized with a condition doctors described as \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\" Some of the children had persistent fever, toxic shock syndrome and features similar to\u00a0Kawasaki disease, the state health advisory said. Kawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. While it's usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems, it can also be deadly. It mainly affects children under the age of five. While pandemic-era policies are still being developed at hotels around the globe and will no doubt vary widely, it's safe to say that guests will see big changes the next time they check in wherever they find themselves. Hotel\u00a0stays\u00a0are likely to be a stripped-down affair, particularly in higher-end hotels where personalized service and amenities have long been part of the draw. The Dutch Safety Board has begun an independent investigation into the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis. The probe will look at the preparations for a pandemic, crisis management, the measures taken and the phasing out of these measures, a statement said Thursday. The Safety Board will also look at the effects of the coronavirus crisis on the safety of vulnerable people in the society, for example due to discontinuation of regular care or social services, the statement added. Its aim is to draw lessons for \u201cpotential future epidemics.\u201d As of Wednesday, the Netherlands had 41,319 reported positive cases and 5,204 people reported dead, according to the\u00a0Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. The estimated number of people infected with coronavirus in the Russian capital is far higher than previously reported, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said Thursday. In an interview on state news channel Rossiya-24, Sobyanin said screening studies found that between 2% and 2.5% of the city\u2019s population \u2013 around 300,000 people \u2013 have contracted the virus. That\u2019s around three times higher than the capital's 92,676 officially confirmed cases.\u00a0 \u201cOur task is to identify as many of these people as possible,\u201d Sobyanin said. He added it was \u201cclear that there are even more really sick people in the city\u201d than those identified through testing. Sobyanin said hospitals had been able to cope with an influx of patients. \"Over the past two weeks, the number of hospitalizations [of people with coronavirus] has not increased,\u201d he said. \u201cMoreover, the number of hospitalized and those who have been discharged shows a positive trend now. More were discharged than were hospitalized. And this is the main result of our work.\u201d The mayor warned, however, that lockdown and distancing measures would not end quickly. \u201cToday we see that it will take a long period to overcome the epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that for a long time we will live in a new reality, one not very comfortable for all of us.\" Poland's upcoming presidential election will be postponed amid concerns about the spread of coronavirus, the country's coalition government leaders said Wednesday. Jaroslaw Kaczynski of the ruling Law and Justice party, and Jaroslaw Gowin of the smaller Agreement party,  announced a\u00a0\"solution that will guarantee Poles the opportunity to take part in democratic elections\" in a joint statement reported by state-run Polish News Agency.\u00a0 \"The speaker of the Sejm will announce new presidential elections at the earliest possible date,\" the statement reads, referring to Poland's lower house of parliament.\u00a0It adds that voting will be done by post, \"in the interests of the safety of Poles in view of the epidemic situation.\"\u00a0 A total of 733 people have died from coronavirus in Poland, where 14,740 cases of the virus have so far been reported, state-run Polish Radio announced late Wednesday.\u00a0 The decision to postpone the vote comes after weeks of criticism of the government.  Campaigners and academics have said that the Law and Justice party is using the pandemic to continue chipping away at democracy and tightening its grip on power. Members of ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom, especially black men and women, face a higher risk of dying from Covid-19, according to data from England and Wales released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday. According to the ONS, the mortality rate from the novel coronavirus is 4.2 times higher for black men than for white men.  The numbers are similar for black women whose death rate from Covid-19 is 4.3 times higher than for white women. The ONS statisticians found that black people are 1.9 times more likely to die of the virus even when age, socio-demographic characteristics and measures of health and disability are taken into account.  People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities had\u00a0\u201cstatistically significant\u00a0raised risk of death\u201d from Covid-19, compared with those of white ethnicity, the ONS said.  \u201cThese results show that the difference between ethnic groups in Covid-19 mortality is partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained,\u201d the ONS said in its report.\u00a0 Russia on Thursday recorded a record daily rise in coronavirus cases, reporting\u00a011,231\u00a0new cases over the last 24-hour period, the country\u2019s Covid-19 response headquarters said in a statement. All told, Russia has seen\u00a0177,160 official cases of coronavirus, and 1,625\u00a0deaths. The Russian government has nationwide lockdown measures in place until May 12, and President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said those measures may be extended and strengthened in some regions of the country. US President Donald Trump\u00a0contradicted a nurse he was honoring in the Oval Office on Wednesday, insisting there are no personal protective equipment shortages in the US despite her account that availability could be \"sporadic.\" A reporter asked the nurses attending the National Nurse Day event if their PPE supplies are where they need to be amid the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic, and many of them nodded in agreement or answered affirmatively. \"I think it's sporadic,\" answered Sophia L. Thomas, president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners. \"I mean, I talk to my colleagues around the country. Certainly there are pockets around the country where PPE is not ideal, but this is an unprecedented time.\" Thomas said she works at a community health center in New Orleans, and that her youngest Covid-19 patient was 4 days old. \"The infection control measures that we learned back when we went to school, one gown and one mask for one patient per day -- this is a different time,\" she said, adding that she has been reusing a single N95 mask for \"a few weeks now.\" \"PPE has been sporadic, but it's been manageable. And we do what we have to do,\" Thomas said. \"We are nurses and we learn to adapt and do whatever we can do for our patients to get the job done and the care provided, and that's what we will continue to do as Covid-19 continues.\" Despite her firsthand experience, Trump disputed Thomas' account. \"Sporadic for you but not sporadic for a lot of other people,\" the President told her.

The BMA, a trade union for British doctors, said it surveyed 16,000 doctors in the UK, asking them about access to PPE, their well-being and drug shortages. The UK government has long been criticized for failing to provide enough adequate protective equipment for the National Health Service (NHS).  The latest PPE controversy came on Thursday, when it emerged that a much touted delivery of around\u00a0400,000 surgical gowns ordered by the government from\u00a0Turkey\u00a0in mid-April was never distributed among NHS workers because it did not meet British safety standards. Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the BMA Council, said in a news release: On the one-hand it shows how resourceful they have been and how much support there has been from the general public in providing kit; but far more importantly, it is a damning indictment of the Government\u2019s abject failure to make sure healthcare workers across the country are being supplied with the life-saving kit they should be. ##Health## In hospitals around the world, doctors are shaking their heads in disbelief as they watch Covid-19 patients who should be comatose or \"seizing\" from hypoxia -- a lack of oxygen in the body's tissues -- check social media, chat with nurses and barely complain of discomfort while breathing. Some have dubbed them \"happy hypoxics,\" a terrible misnomer for what could be a long, slow recovery -- or worse. The proper medical term is \"silent hypoxia.\" It happens when people are unaware they are being deprived of oxygen and are therefore showing up to the hospital in much worse health than they realize. Typically, these patients have experienced some Covid-19 symptoms for two to seven days before they show up at the hospital complaining of sudden chest tightness or an inability to breathe deeply, said Dr. Richard Levitan, who's been an emergency room physician for some 30 years. While he practices at Littleton Regional Healthcare in New Hampshire, Levitan recently spent almost two weeks volunteering in the emergency room of a New York City hospital near the epicenter of the city's devastating outbreak. Levitan said scans of these patients' lungs showed signs of pneumonia so severe they should be in terrible pain as they gasp for their next breath. \"Their X-rays\u00a0looked awful, their oxygen was terrible, and yet they're completely awake, alert on a cell phone, and they all said is they've been somewhat sick for days,\" he said.\n\"And then only recently did they notice either shortness of breath or fatigue or something else,\" Levitan added. \"That's what is so fascinating about this disease and also so terrible.\" Read more:  ##Health## The British government has yet to make \u201cany final decisions,\u201d on which of the anti-coronavirus restrictions it will ease on Monday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cWe haven't made any final decisions on these issues yet,\u201d Lewis told BBC Breakfast. \u201cI would just say to people to not get too carried away with what we may be reading and just wait until the government guidelines and the prime minister's statement.\u201d The Northern Ireland secretary also seemed to pour cold water on those craving to go back to work starting Monday. \u201cI would say to people that the current government position is very clear that where you can work from home you should, we should stay home wherever we can,\" he said. The background: UK media reported on Wednesday that stay-at-home advice would be scrapped from Monday, according to information given to MPs by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. According to The Telegraph, Johnson said that people would be encouraged to go back to work if possible and allowed \"unlimited\" exercise outside. ##Daily Life## A twelfth case of Covid-19 in Vatican City is also an employee of Pope Francis, the Holy See press office said on Wednesday.\u00a0 The person has been working remotely since early March and is now under observation at home, according to the director of the Holy See press office, Matteo Bruni.

When she decided to\u00a0update German citizens\u00a0about the coronavirus outbreak in March, it was the first unscheduled televised address she had given in almost 15 years of leadership. The speech was a hit. Merkel, a pastor's daughter with a PhD in quantum chemistry, presented the grim facts of the pandemic while also offering a dose of compassion. She referenced her\u00a0East German background\u00a0and the difficulty she had with the idea of restricting freedom of movement. But she explained why doing so was necessary, and got Germans on her side. \"She is not a great orator, but this calm message to the nation contributed to the confidence of the people: 80% to 90% felt she can do it,\" said Wolfgang Merkel (no relation to the Chancellor), professor of political science at Berlin's Humboldt University. \n\"When people are deeply insecure about the future, they seek protection and more certainty from the government.\" It has been a real transformation for Merkel, who began the year as a lame duck leader. Her political record had been damaged by the\u00a0huge backlash\u00a0against her \"open door\" refugee policy, her\u00a0succession plan collapsed\u00a0and her party was rapidly losing ground to the fringes. But when Covid-19 began to spread across the globe, Merkel stepped up once again.

But what about the crews that kept these gigantic vessels going, and looked after guests as panic over the coronavirus swept across the oceans? For many of those working in the cruise industry, the nightmare of being aboard a ship that had carried people with coronavirus has continued -- sometimes without an end in sight. Isolated, denied the swift repatriations offered to passengers and, in some cases, made to endure tough conditions without pay, some of those sequestered at sea have been describing the bureaucratic tangle that has trapped them, often within meters of shore. \"I'm hoping we don't get forgotten about, to be honest,\" says MaShawn Morton, who works for Princess Cruises. \"It seems like nobody cares what's happening to us out here.\" Read more: The Bank of England\u00a0has warned that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic will see the UK economy plunge into a deep recession.

The shipment came amid warnings that NHS Trusts risked running out of surgical gowns. \u201cThis is a global pandemic with many countries procuring PPE, leading to shortages around the world, not just the UK,\u201d the DHSC spokesperson said. \n\u201cWe are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically and brought together the NHS, industry and the armed forces to create a comprehensive PPE distribution network to deliver critical supplies to the front line.\u201d The spokesperson declined to comment if the UK would seek a refund for the shipment in question. ##Health## ##Business## The\u00a0staggering economic pain\u00a0-- perhaps the worst since the 1930s -- of the American economy in the time of\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0will be graphically underscored in two\u00a0new rounds of unemployment data\u00a0that are due on Thursday and Friday. The\u00a0figures will show Americans\u00a0who have and will lose their livelihoods as common victims of the most cruel public health crisis in 100 years, along with the sick and the more than 73,000 people who have so far died. The prospect of a prolonged economic slump will have important implications in politics. It is already threatening to dampen memories of the roaring economy that\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0was banking on to carry him to a second term. It may also provide an opening to presumptive Democratic nominee\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0who helped bring the country back from the last economic crisis in the Obama administration. Every day brings signs that what first looked like temporary job cuts could turn into permanent layoffs.\u00a0GE, Airbnb and United Airlines\u00a0this week for instance announced cuts in thousands of positions as business dries up. Discouraging news on the wider penetration of the virus raises the possibility of new spikes in infection that could further complicate the path to a full recovery. The emerging reality that the \"rocket\" like rebound the President predicted is unlikely may be behind Trump's increasingly frantic statements on a emergency he has also claimed will soon be over. \"We went through the worst attack we've ever had on our country,\" he said on Wednesday. For weeks early this year, Trump was in denial and painted the threat from the virus as tiny. Read the full analysis: ##Business## If you're just joining our live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic, here are the key headlines today: Germany's death toll rises above 7,000: At least 7,119 people have now died from the coronavirus in Germany, according to the country's center for disease control.  Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced Germany will allow shops to reopen and people to meet in small groups as strict virus prevention measures ease. \nUK to scrap stay-at-home message: Some of the restrictive measures in the UK will be lifted from Monday. Britons will once again be allowed \"unlimited\" exercise outside and people will be encouraged to return to work if safe. The UK has reported more than 30,000 coronavirus deaths -- only the US has seen more. \nJapan set to fast track experimental drug: Tokyo's speedy move to approve remdesivir follows on from the US, which authorized the emergency use of the drug to treat coronavirus patients last Friday. A panel of experts will meet today in Japan so that the drug\u2019s approval can be completed as soon as possible.\nChina exports surprisingly strong: The country's exports ticked up 3.5% in April compared to a year earlier in US dollar terms, according to data released by Beijing. The result was much stronger than expected -- analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a 15.7% decline. \nTrump reverses on task force: US President Donald Trump said the White House coronavirus task force will now continue \"indefinitely,\" one day after his administration said it would begin to phase it out. The focus of the group will shift from preventing the outbreak toward finding a vaccine for the virus, Trump said.\nVirus is \"worse than Pearl Harbor,\" Trump says: The US President ramped up his rhetoric against China on Wednesday, saying Beijing could have stopped the pandemic and calling it \"the worst attack we've ever had on our country.\" As complaints about dire shortages of protective gear for medical workers on the front lines of the Covid-19 crisis began to stream in, US President Donald Trump was quick to point the finger of blame at his predecessor, Barack Obama. It was Obama and other administrations,\u00a0he said, who left the shelves of the nation's Strategic National Stockpile bare of the items needed to combat the coronavirus. To an extent, the President was right. The Obama administration did use and then failed to replace items from the stockpile to fight the 2009 H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic. But Trump hadn't replaced those items either, despite repeated warnings that the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic, stockpile experts said. The President's criticism also ignored a key point: The stockpile was never intended -- or funded -- to be a panacea for a pandemic. Rather, it serves as one piece of the overall supply chain puzzle during a disaster. \"People who somehow believed it was a bottomless pit filled with everything they can imagine were not paying attention,\" said Tara O'Toole, a physician and former Department of Homeland Security official who once chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile. Read more: California will be refunded $247 million it paid to a Chinese firm to deliver 200 million N95 respirator masks under a secretive contract which was not disclosed to the public until Wednesday. After weeks of questions and pressure, the state disclosed the refund and released the contract worth nearly $1 billion with BYD, a Chinese automaker with offices in downtown Los Angeles. The contract, which included an upfront payment of $495 million, called for the production of 500 million face masks over a two-and-a-half-month period.\u00a0 At a news conference Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters the state had received 15 million surgical masks from the company, but was still waiting on tens of millions\u00a0of\u00a0N95 respirator masks that were\u00a0expected to arrive in California this week but had failed to meet a delivery deadline.\u00a0 The contract between California and BYD requires the Chinese manufacturer to certify the effectiveness of its N95 masks with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\u00a0It was unclear what caused the certification delay. As recently as mid-April, Newsom said the delivery of masks from BYD would\u00a0be\u00a0on time and that, in fact, the state and federal government were auditing BYD factories in China. \u201cWe have teams on the ground in China, doing audits, and doing factory visits,\u201d Newsom told reporters on April 13.\u00a0 It is not known whether the masks have been delivered to the United States and are currently subject to inspection in the country. ##Health## ##Business## More than 7,000 people in Germany have now died of symptoms related to the novel coronavirus, according\u00a0the country's center for disease control. Data released\u00a0Wednesday showed 123 new deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total number to 7,119, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The institute also recorded an increase in new infections of 1,284, while 2,500 recovered from the disease in the same time frame. On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that Germany had made it through the first phase of the pandemic and announced an easing of the restrictions put in place to stop the spread of the virus. ##Health## ##Daily Life## Japan is set to fast-track approval for the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for coronavirus patients. Japan\u2019s relatively speedy move to approve remdesivir follows on from the United States, which authorized the emergency use of the drug to treat coronavirus patients last Friday. It will be the first drug licensed in Japan to treat coronavirus patients.\u00a0 Japanese health minister Katsunobu Kato said on Tuesday that a panel of experts would meet Thursday so that the drug\u2019s approval could be completed as soon as possible.  In Japan, the approval process for an experimental drug usually takes up to a year, but given the urgency of the situation, officials are shortening that time period to a week, according to public broadcaster NHK. Only drugs that have been approved by other countries can be fast-tracked for use in Japan, NHK reported. Remdesivir, made by US-based Gilead Sciences, was tested against Ebola -- but with little success.  A US government-funded study conducted in April found that coronavirus patients who took\u00a0remdesivir recovered faster than patients who did not. It improved recovery time for coronavirus patients from 15 to 11 days. But beyond the initial optimism, the study also made clear that remdesivir is far from a cure for Covid-19 as it does not prevent death and is not yet widely available to the public. ##Health## China's exports ticked up 3.5% in April compared to a year earlier in US dollar terms, according to customs data released by Beijing on Thursday.  That was much stronger than expected: Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a 15.7% decline. The increase also reversed March's 6.6% drop. Last month's boost might have been aided by a backlog of orders that were cleared as factories reopened from coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics. Business was shut down for a significant chunk of the first quarter as the virus forced China's economy to a near-halt. Evans-Pritchard warned in a Thursday research note, though, that the uptick likely won't last. Exporters are \"unlikely to be immune from the sharp slowdown in global activity for long,\u201d he said. Imports for April, meanwhile, were weak as the rest of the world contended with the pandemic. Data showed Thursday that imports fell 14.2% in April, worse than the 11.2% decline that analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected. Imports fell 0.9% in March. The sharp deterioration in activity among China\u2019s key trade partners will probably result in much weaker exports in May,\u00a0according to\u00a0Evans-Pritchard. Meanwhile, the threat of additional US tariffs on Chinese goods shouldn\u2019t be ignored, he said. Trade tensions are once again brewing: US President Donald Trump hinted late last week that the United States could punish China with new tariffs because of the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak. ##Business## US President Donald Trump\u00a0declared Wednesday his\u00a0coronavirus task force\u00a0would continue \"indefinitely\" a day after he and\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0said they were\u00a0phasing out the health-focused panel\u00a0in favor of a group focused on reopening the economy. Trump, who said the panel would adopt a new focus on vaccines, is also considering naming an administration point person on treatment and vaccine efforts, according to people familiar with the matter. And Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, continues to play a central role in the White House's response effort, including on vaccines, despite\u00a0questions about the efficacy of his attempts\u00a0to source badly needed supplies. According to Pence's public schedule, the task force was slated to meet at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday. A few hours earlier, Trump explained his retreat on phasing out the panel. \"I thought we could wind it down sooner. But I had no idea how popular the task force is until, actually, yesterday when I started talking about winding it down,\" Trump said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with nurses. \"I get calls from very respected people saying, 'I think it would be better to keep it going, it's done such a good job.' \"\n\"It's a respected task force. I know it myself,\" he added. \"I didn't know whether or not it was appreciated by the public but it is appreciated by the public.\" Read more: ##Health## Two customers shot two McDonald's employees in Oklahoma City on Wednesday\u00a0after they were told to leave the store's dining area due to coronavirus restrictions, police said. The suspects got angry and took out a gun when they were asked to leave, Oklahoma City Police Lt. Michelle Henderson said. Two workers were shot and a third was injured, Henderson said, during \"the melee that ensued.\" Police told CNN affiliate\u00a0KOCO\u00a0that one of the victims was shot in the leg while the other was shot in the shoulder. Both injuries are considered non life-threatening, the affiliate reported. Police at the scene also said a female employee sustained cuts to her head, KOCO reported. The two suspects then fled and were apprehended nearby, Henderson added. The incident is one of several protests from residents across the country responding to restrictions in place to combat the virus. In Michigan, a Family Dollar store security guard was shot after telling a customer\u00a0to wear a face mask -- a mandate in place by the state for all retail stores. ##Daily Life## Blood thinning drugs could help save some patients who are the most severely affected by the novel coronavirus, doctors reported Wednesday. The findings from a team at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York could help with a troubling problem that has shocked and horrified doctors treating coronavirus patients around the world -- blood clots throughout the body that complicate an already hard-to-treat disease. The team now says it is running experiments to see which anticoagulants may work best, and at which doses. \"The patients who received anticoagulants did better than those who didn't,\" said Dr. Valentin Fuster, director of Mount Sinai Heart and physician-in-chief of Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\"This has implications already. People, I believe, should treat these patients with antithrombotics,\" he added. The findings are not clear enough yet to make solid recommendations. The team noted that patients who were already severely ill were more likely to be given the blood thinners. Read more: ##Health## US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States does not have certainty about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, despite claiming over the weekend there was \"enormous evidence\" the virus originated\u00a0in a Chinese lab. Although he conceded he couldn't be certain, Pompeo continued to push his lab claim, countering the leading theory among intelligence experts and international analysts that the virus came into human contact at a wet market.  Assessments circulated among US intelligence-sharing allies have posited that it is\u00a0\"highly unlikely\"\u00a0the virus originated in a lab. The US intelligence community has said it is looking into both possibilities. In an interview on Fox Business later Wednesday evening, Pompeo doubled down on his claim that he had \"seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\" but added that he'd be \"happy to see evidence that disproves that.\" The top US diplomat has maintained an aggressive line of attack on China's handling of the virus as the Trump administration looks to deflect blame for its response to the disease that has now killed more than 73,000 Americans and stalled the economy in the crucial months before the presidential election. Pompeo also insisted there was no contradiction between his position and comments by other senior US officials who have cast doubt on his theory. \"We don't have certainty,\" Pompeo said at a news conference at the State Department Wednesday. \"And there is significant evidence that this came from the laboratory. Those statements can both be true. I've made them both. Administration officials have made them. They're all true,\" he said.

At least 24,073 cases of the virus have been confirmed in Pakistan, killing 564 people. The spike in cases comes after Pakistan recorded its highest number of coronavirus deaths in a single day on Tuesday. ##Health## South Korea reported four new cases of the novel coronavirus today, including one new local infection -- the country's first since Saturday. The other three cases were imported. At least 10,810 cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in South Korea, which at one time during the early stages of the pandemic had one of the largest outbreaks in the world. But Seoul has brought the virus mostly under control and between Sunday and Tuesday there were no new local infections recorded. One more Covid-19-related fatality was reported today, bringing the country's death toll to 256. So far, 9,419 patients have recovered after being diagnosed with the coronavirus, meaning less than 13% of all cases are still active. ##Health## Editor's note: Catherine Pearlman is a clinical social worker, associate professor at Brandman University and the author of\u00a0Ignore It!: How Selectively Looking the Other Way Can Decrease Behavioral Problems and Increase Parenting Satisfaction. Go for a walk, visit any open establishment or public space, and you will note a disconcerting phenomenon: People without masks. There is a pandemic. Tens of thousands of Americans are dead because of Covid-19, a disease that spreads in droplets that are expelled by infected humans, including as they talk or cough, and whether they show symptoms or not. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0recommends\u00a0that everyone wear a cloth face covering in public, especially where there is a high degree of community-based transmission (that is, when the source of infection is unknown). I live in California,\u00a0where nearly 60,000 people have been infected.\u00a0 Across the country 1.2 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, with more than 73,000 lives lost -- and projections for the future (another peak in the fall?) are\u00a0really\u00a0grim. Meanwhile, hospitals and their staff are pushed to the breaking point caring for the sick, with medical staff working weeks without days off to treat the afflicted, risking their own lives and those of their family. And yet, so many people refuse to take warnings seriously to protect themselves and others by wearing a mask in public. It's hard to pinpoint how many of us are clueless and careless -- maybe half of those who go outside? A third? Some other fraction? -- but it's certainly way too many. The lack of empathy is jarring. We need a shift. Read the full opinion: ##Daily Life## New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern today outlined how coronavirus restrictions will ease when the country moves to a lower alert level. The country is currently at level 3 of a four-point Covid-19 alert system, and Ardern described what life would look like under level 2. She said that social distancing measures at level 2 had been designed to \"get as many people back to work as possible and get the economy back up and running but in the safest way possible.\" Borders would remain closed to everybody except New Zealand citizens. Meanwhile, citizens returning to the country would still need to isolate in hotels away from others.  \"Test, contract trace, isolate. This is our Covid business as usual,\" Ardern said.\u00a0\u00a0 Restrictions on mass gatherings would remain under the level 2 alert. \"A trip from Wellington to Napier to see your mum is fine, a trip from Wellington to Napier to go to a big conference with an open bar is not fine,\" Ardern advised.\u00a0 There would also be no stadium crowds, but \"sport will be played,\" Ardern said. Ardern said that staying 2 meters (6.5 ft) away from a stranger would be advised when level 2 comes into force, but those returning to work would be able to work at closer quarters because contact tracing would be easier.\u00a0 The prime minister did not say when level 2 would be announced. She ended her briefing by saying, \"One thing to remember -- Covid is still with us.\" ##Daily Life## German Chancellor Angela Merkel set out plans Wednesday for the gradual reopening of the country after weeks-long restrictions imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Limits on social contact will remain in place until June 5, she said, but Germans can now meet with members of one other household as well as their own. People must still remain 1.5 meters apart and cover their mouths and noses in public. Shops can reopen but with additional hygiene measures, Merkel said, speaking at a news conference following a video meeting with the prime ministers of Germany's 16 states. \"The first phase of the pandemic is behind us but we are still at the beginning and it will be with us for a long time,\" she said. Germany's top football league, the Bundesliga, can also resume play in the second half of May, Merkel said. She did not specify if this would be with spectators or behind closed doors. It would be the first major European league to resume playing. Last week France canceled its season and declared Paris Saint-Germain the winner of Ligue 1. Merkel said authorities would watch local regions to ensure any outbreak was stopped. \"We can afford a bit of courage,\" she said, but cautioned that \"we have to watch that this thing does not slip out of our hands.\" Read more: ##Daily Life## If you're just joining our live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic, here are some key headlines today: Trump reverses on task force: US President Donald Trump said the White House coronavirus task force will now continue \"indefinitely,\" one day after his administration said it would begin to phase it out.

Britons will once again be allowed \"unlimited\" exercise outside and people will be encouraged to return to work if safe. The UK has reported more than 30,000 coronavirus deaths -- only the US has seen more.  Questions surrounding the origins of the novel coronavirus have sparked a war of words between Washington and Beijing -- and threatens to worsen already strained relations. In recent days, US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have doubled down on\u00a0the assertion\u00a0that the virus originated from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December. The claim has unsurprisingly drawn\u00a0fierce rebuttal\u00a0from the Chinese government, which on Wednesday described the accusation as a \"smear\" intended to bolster Trump's reelection chances.  But intelligence shared among the Five Eyes network -- an alliance between the United States and four Anglophone allies, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada -- also reportedly appears to\u00a0contradict\u00a0the Trump administration's assertion. Read more: Thousands of US Marines are expected to head to Australia in the coming weeks after the Australian government granted an exemption to Covid-19 travel restrictions, the US Marine Corps said in a statement. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper first announced in a tweet the resumption of the annual Marine Rotational Force-Darwin, in which as many as 2,500 Marines are deployed to Australia\u2019s Northern Territory for six months during the country\u2019s dry season. The deployment had been suspended in late March after Australia closed its borders completely to all non-citizens and non-residents. The US Marines will undergo a 14-day quarantine and face other requirements, Chuck Little, a spokesman for US Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said in a statement. \u201cThe Marine Corps is committed to ensuring the health and safety of its forces and the Australian people, including local indigenous communities,\u201d Little said. Little did not say exactly when the deployment would resume or how many Marines would be going. But last year\u2019s deployment to the Australian base in Darwin involved 2,500 US Marines and this year\u2019s was expected to be similar. Equipment deployed during the 2019 rotation, which the Australian Defense Ministry called the most capable since the deployment began in 2012, included MV-22 Osprey aircraft and advanced radars and artillery systems. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## Epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers said on CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper 360 that our lives will look different for the next 12 to 18 months, at least until there is a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re all going to have to stay home for 12 to 18 months,\u201d Rivers said. Rivers is a senior scholar and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n\u201cI think there will be a period where we are able to shift from everyone having to stay home to slow the spread, into these case-based interventions.\u2019 That means contact tracing and isolation and quarantine of people who could spread the virus. \u201cHow our lives look over the next 12 to 18 months, it will change. We will start to reintroduce more activities into the community, but we\u2019re not going to have the vaccine. Until we have a vaccine our lives will look different than they did,\u201d Rivers said.\u00a0 The country will also need to start planning for manufacturing and distribution now, Rivers said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which final product, which vaccine is going to be the winner and that makes it a little bit more difficult to plan around,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cBut we can start to identify what are those opportunities to shorten that timeline to scale up our capacities, so that when there is a product available we have what we need to get it to people as quickly as possible.\u201d ##Daily Life## Some doctors are urging the continued use of the HIV drugs lopinavir\u2013ritonavir to treat severely ill patients with coronavirus, even though a recent study found no significant difference in recovery time between patients taking the drugs and those who were not. Doctors from several universities, including Columbia, Michigan State and the University of Pennsylvania, wrote letters published in the New England Journal of Medicine this week saying there were indications the drug combination might help some patients. A study published in March showed patients in China who were given the lopinavir-ritonavir combination did not recover any faster. But Dr. Piero Dalerba, an assistant professor in the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and two of his colleagues\u00a0said secondary findings were \u201cactually very promising.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI was reading the article and I noticed, however, that they reported also that the treatment was associated with a reduced mortality,\u201d Delerba said. \n\u201cSo, less patients were dying in the treated group, and also importantly to me, I also noticed that the adverse events, the severe adverse events, the frequency of similar incidents was reduced in the patients who were treated with the drugs.\u201d Health experts agree more research is needed on the drug combination and are hoping a much larger study by the World Health Organization on drugs that could be used to treat the coronavirus, including lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, could offer more insight into a possible treatment for the virus. ##Health## A 57-year-old man from El Salvador became the first person to die from coronavirus while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, a senior immigration official said on Wednesday. The man had been held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, California, the official said. \"He contracted (Covid-19) at the facility,\" the senior immigration official said. \"As soon as he tested positive he was sent to the hospital. He died there.\" Reports of the man's death drew swift condemnation from immigrant rights organizations, who've been pushing for weeks for ICE to release more detainees from its facilities and arguing coronavirus poses a deadly threat to immigrants behind bars. \"The heartbreaking tragedy at Otay Mesa could have been prevented had US immigration officials heeded the recommendations of medical experts and acted in time,\" said Dr. Ranit Mishori, a senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights, in a statement Wednesday. \n\"Thousands of doctors, advocates, and even the former acting head of ICE have been sounding the alarm for months about the grave risks of immigration detention amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The government cannot say it did not know this would happen.\" It's been six weeks since ICE announced the first detainee in its custody had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. According to the latest statistics published on the agency's website, 674 detainees in ICE custody have tested positive for the virus out of a total of 1,346 detainees tested. The lead researcher overseeing a clinical vaccine trial for the novel coronavirus said scientists won\u2019t know definitively if any of the vaccines work to prevent infection until April or May of next year.  Dr. Mark Mulligan said on CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett OutFront that a one-year time frame is a \u201cblazing process\u201d for vaccine development. \u201cWe\u2019re doing things in months that normally would be done in years,\u201d Mulligan said.  Mulligan is the director of the Vaccine Center at NYU\u2019s Langone Health and is working with Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE on the trial. NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Maryland were the first centers to enroll patients in a vaccine trial for the novel coronavirus. Study participants got the vaccine this week. Pfizer and BioNTech launched a similar trial in Germany.\u00a0 The first phrase of the trial will determine if it is safe. That typically takes three to four months, Mulligan said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually the most important first question and then we want to know if it\u2019s tolerated well and if it produces an antibody response that might be protective after those first three or four months,\u201d Mulligan said.\n\u201cYou go onto the question does it protect, and that\u2019ll take several months as well,\u201d he added. \u201cI do really think we\u2019re talking about getting through to the end of the year and into early next year before we would have a definitive answer.\u201d Watch here: ##Health## The UK government will scrap its stay-at-home advice as part of the plan to gradually ease coronavirus restrictions, UK media reported on Wednesday evening. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs earlier in the day that he will be lifting some restrictive measures starting next Monday, and will officially announce the details on Sunday. Johnson will expand the once-a-day limit on exercise to allow \"unlimited\" exercise either individually or with members of the same household, The Telegraph reported.\u00a0 He will also encourage people to go back to work if they can do it safely, and in a divergence to the strategy pursued by the government so far, he will tell those using public transport to use face-coverings where social distancing is not possible, according to The Telegraph. The Scottish government has already recommended use of face coverings in crowded spaces.\u00a0 Schools could start a \"phased\" return of pupils at the beginning of June, but restaurants, bars and cafes have not been given a firm date for reopening, The Telegraph reported.\u00a0 ##Daily Life## ##Business## Brazil recorded at least 10,503 new cases of coronavirus and 615 deaths in the past 24 hours, according to the country's health minister. At least 125,218 cases and 8,536 deaths have been reported in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University. Brazil currently has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Latin America while Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has faced criticism for downplaying the threat of the virus. Bolsonaro has repeatedly attended large political rallies calling for an end to quarantine measures in the country. ##Health## Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s official spokesman, Gen. Ot\u00e1vio Santana do R\u00eago Barros, has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement released by his office. R\u00eago Barros tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, according to the statement. His team said the results were confirmed Tuesday and that he is recovering in his home. According to the statement, he wasn\u2019t displaying \u201cany symptoms that should raise any concern.\u201d ##Health## Researchers in the UK say they have seen an \u201cunprecedented cluster\u201d of eight children with rare inflammatory problems amid the coronavirus pandemic. The cases, they said, bear resemblance to a severe form of Kawasaki disease -- a rare condition that causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. All of the children were previously fit and well, the researchers said in a study published Wednesday.\u00a0 Five of the children received mechanical ventilation through a tube in their windpipes, and one was put on an ECMO machine -- a device that takes over for the heart and lungs. Seven of the children survived, and one died from a stroke. Four of the children had known exposure to coronavirus, and two eventually tested positive. Six of the children were of Afro-Caribbean descent, and five were boys. In the study, published in the medical journal The Lancet, the researchers said the case cluster formed the basis of a national alert. In late April, Britain\u2019s National Health Service sent an\u00a0\u201curgent alert\u201d to doctors saying they had seen cases of atypical\u00a0Kawasaki\u00a0disease that could be linked to coronavirus. As their study went to press, the researchers said they had treated more than 20 children with similar signs. The first 10 of these children tested positive for coronavirus antibodies \u2013 including the eight who made up the original \u201ccluster\u201d of cases. That suggests they had been exposed to the virus in the past, even if their diagnostic test came back negative at the time. \u201cWe suggest that this clinical picture represents a new phenomenon affecting previously asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting as a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiorgan involvement similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome,\u201d the researchers wrote.\u00a0 ##Health## US President Donald Trump has again leveled accusations that China could have stopped the global coronavirus pandemic, calling the spread \"the worst attack we've ever had on our country.\" Speaking from the Oval Office today, the President went on to say, \"This is worse than\u00a0Pearl\u00a0Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center.\" What we know:\u00a0So far, more than 73,000 people in America have died from coronavirus. In comparison, more than 2,000 Americans were killed in the\u00a0Pearl Harbor bombings\u00a0during World War II. On\u00a0September 11, 2001, a total of 2,977 people were killed in New York City, Washington, DC and outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. But while Pearl Harbor and 9/11 were direct and targeted attacks on the United States, the coronavirus pandemic is impacting countries all over the world, including China. As of today, Johns Hopkins University puts\u00a0China's death toll from the virus at 4,637. There's never been an attack like this,\" Trump said today in the Oval Office.\nThe President added: \"And it should have never happened. Could have been stopped at the source. Could have been stopped in China. It should have been stopped right at the source. And it wasn't.\" In recent days, Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have doubled down on\u00a0the assertion\u00a0that the virus originated from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December. The claim has unsurprisingly drawn\u00a0fierce rebuttal\u00a0from the Chinese government, which described the accusation as a \"smear\" intended to bolster Trump's reelection chances.
