Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily.

Trains and flights are now operating, and healthy residents and visitors will be allowed to leave. However, Chinese officials warn there is still work to be done to prevent another outbreak. In the UK,\u00a0London Mayor Sadiq Khan says the country is \"nowhere near\" lifting its lockdown, and estimates the peak of the virus is still a week and a half away. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still in an intensive care unit battling coronavirus symptoms. There's also concern that the methodology behind the UK's daily death toll updates could be leading to an underreporting of\u00a0the true number. Tuesday marked the deadliest day yet for coronavirus cases in the US, with 1,858 recorded deaths. The new nadir came as President Trump picked a fight with the World Health Organization, which he inaccurately claimed underrepresented the threat of the virus. Follow updates here.\u00a0 \u00a02. \u00a0White House The White House is in a state of flux.\u00a0White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham\u00a0was moved out of her position without even giving a single briefing, and was replaced by\u00a0Kayleigh\u00a0McEnany, the Trump 2020 campaign's press secretary. McEnany is the fourth person to hold the position. In the past, she has downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus, saying that under Trump's watch, the virus would not threaten American shores. Trump also removed\u00a0acting inspector general for the Defense Department, Glenn Fine, from his post. This means Fine will no longer\u00a0chair the\u00a0Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, sparking concerns over who will supervise the disbursement of the\u00a0$2 trillion in emergency coronavirus funding.\u00a0 3. Health Lupus and arthritis patients are facing a shortage of\u00a0chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine after President Trump touted the drugs as a possible treatments for coronavirus.\u00a0Medical experts warn such a claim is unproven.\u00a0Dr. Mehmet Oz, the controversial celebrity cardiac surgeon, has also started talking up the drugs. Meanwhile on the frontlines, hospital workers are becoming desperate as ERs are overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. Some nurses at Detroit's\u00a0Sinai-Grace Hospital staged a work stoppage and demanded\u00a0hospital administrators bring in more nurses to help out. They didn't. The nurses who made the demands said they were doing so because they found it impossible to properly treat people amid a crush patients and not enough medical equipment.\u00a0 4. US Navy Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly has resigned after calling the ousted commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt \"stupid\" for sounding the alarm over coronavirus cases on the aircraft carrier.\u00a0Capt. Brett Crozier, the then-commanding officer of ship, sent a memo warning of coronavirus spreading among the sailors on the aircraft carrier. Modly removed him from his post and then insulted him for being \"too naive or too stupid\" during an address to the ship's crew, who had given Crozier a warm farewell just days earlier. Though Modly initially defended his remarks against criticism, he apologized after being reprimanded by\u00a0Defense Secretary Mark Esper.\u00a0 5. Stimulus bill Lawmakers are rushing\u00a0to get their priorities included in the next coronavirus stimulus bill. The \"phase four\" bill would attempt to patch over some of the parts missing from last month's massive $2.2 trillion package. How could so much money not cover everything? For starters, the Treasury Department wants to ask\u00a0Congress for an additional $250 billion for the Small Business Administration's new loan program after the $350 billion program experienced a rocky rollout. Top Democrats\u00a0want more money for state and local governments, funds for personal protective equipment, more payments for individuals, and assistance for those still on the job despite coronavirus restrictions.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE UFC President Dana White wants to stage the UFC 249 fight on a private island\u00a0 That's literally\u00a0\"Mortal Kombat.\" Churches are stocking up on disposable, pre-filled communion cups before Easter\u00a0 When you've gotta take the host to go, you've gotta take the host to go.\u00a0 The ABC series \"Modern Family\" signs off tonight after 11 years\u00a0 The show has run for 250 episodes.\u00a0 The MLB is considering having teams play all their games in just the Phoenix area, with no fans\u00a0 Other leagues are also considering weird solutions to the sports void.\u00a0 Disney is releasing a series of shorts called \"At Home with Olaf\" Parents, you will never be rid of \"Frozen.\" \"Frozen\" lives with you now.
