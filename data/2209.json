Not only can doing your own nails be fun, it can also work as a distraction in stressful times like these when self-care is more important than ever.  We spoke with Jaclyn Duguay-Gordon, manicurist at Green Tangerine Spa & Salon in Boston, to steer us straight when it comes to DIY nails. Turns out, all it takes is a few simple steps and the right products. Read through and use her tips, and you'll end up with an Insta-worthy manicure that will have everyone who sees you (even just on the 'gram) wondering how you did it. Get your old polish off Now if you're rocking regular polish, you know that a good polish remover and file is all you need to get the job done. But if you're wearing gel polish and you're stuck at home, Duguay-Gordon has guidance.  \"If you cannot make it to the salon for a gel removal, the first step is to use a fine-grit nail file to gently rough up the top coat and break the seal,\" she says. \"Then use pure acetone in a glass bowl to soak for three to five minutes. Use a birchwood stick to gently remove the remaining jelly-like substance.\" Mineral Fusion Nail Polish Remover ($8.22; walmart.com)  This acetone-free remover can gently remove regular polish without over-drying nails.  _______________________________________________________________________________  Zoya Remove Plus 3-in-1 Formula ($23.95; walmart.com)  Excellent for weaker nails, this formula from Zoya conditions nails while removing polish.  _______________________________________________________________________________  Deborah Lippmann The Stripper Lavender ($19; nordstrom.com) If you're wearing traditional nail polish, try Lippmann's gassed-up remover, which takes just one swipe to remove the color. _______________________________________________________________________________ Deborah Lippmann Smooth Operator Buffer Nail File ($12; sephora.com) The smooth operator buffer file is gentle on the surface of the nails and keeps them smooth and shiny. _______________________________________________________________________________  Iridesi Nail Files and Buffers Washable Emery Boards ($11.99; amazon.com) This 12-pack of simple emery boards has small grit for precise filing on one side and a coarser on the other for fast filing down.  _______________________________________________________________________________  Onyx Professional 100% Acetone Glitter & Polish Remover ($4.76; walmart.com)  For removing gel polish, soaking your nails in this 100% acetone formula can do the trick.  _______________________________________________________________________________  Teenitor Nail Polish Gel Remover Tools Kit ($13.99; amazon.com)  Get the salon gel-removal experience at home with this kit: It comes with a file, cuticle peeler and soak art remover, which can help remove nail tips and polish without damage.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Graham Handsdown Birchwood Cuticle Sticks ($7.50; amazon.com) You've seen these tiny wood sticks at your salon. They're a lot easier on your cuticles and nail beds than the metal tools in many kits to help remove gel polish.  Prep your hands Before you paint your new polish, you'll want to get your hands and nails in shape \u2014 and this is seriously the best part of a manicure anyway. \"Use a fine-grit buffer to buff your natural nail,\" Duguay-Gordon says. \"And finally a cuticle oil or hand lotion to rehydrate.\" If your nails are looking a little long since your last appointment, this is when you can further file and clip them down to get the shape you want, too.  Tropical Shine Colossal 4-Way Blue-Pink Buffer ($9.99; amazon.com)   This inexpensive Tropical Shine tool is the only buffer most of us need. It's not only a buffer, but it also files, smooths and shines your nails.  _______________________________________________________________________________  Tweezerman Nail Clipper Set ($10.99; target.com)  This set of two clippers \u2014 one small and one large \u2014 will last you a lifetime.   _______________________________________________________________________________  Barefoot Scientist Inner Strength Nail Cuticle Renewal Drops ($19.99; amazon.com) This luxurious oil absorbs quickly, strengthen cuticles and nail beds, and has a built-in drop applicator. So bonus: no mess! _______________________________________________________________________________  Caudalie Hand & Nail Cream ($15; sephora.com) This classic hand and nail cream will keep your skin soft and your cuticles uncracked. Pick a color Since everyone wants to get the most out of a polish, especially when they do the work themselves, it's important to invest in a polish that you really know sticks. \"CND Vinylux, Opi Infinity Shine and Essie Gel Couture are great long-lasting polishes,\" she says. \"None of these require a base coat, and each have a gel-like top coat for which a UV/LED light is not needed, which makes for easy removal with just a polish remover. All have long-lasting wear, generally for up to seven days with proper nail prep.\" CND Vinylux ($11.20; walmart.com) Try this long-lasting polish in #283 Element, a bright and jolly red. _______________________________________________________________________________  OPI Infinity Shine ($13; amazon.com) This high-shine polish delivers in a classic pink. _______________________________________________________________________________  Essie Gel Couture ($11.49; target.com) Try a lovely lilac shade in this powerful polish.
