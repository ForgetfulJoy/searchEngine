Will the show go on amid coronavirus fears?\u00a0So far, yes. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door Stay Indoors. (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus\u00a0 California has ordered its nearly 40 million residents to stay home to avoid spreading the coronavirus. It's the first statewide order of its kind, but other countries are enacting similar measures. Argentina, home to 45 million people, has also ordered people to stay home, with limited exceptions for\u00a0grocery shopping or doctor appointments. US cases of Covid-19 spiked yesterday to 13,000\u00a0and are rapidly approaching 250,000 worldwide. In Italy, the 3,405 or more\u00a0coronavirus deaths have surpassed the death toll recorded in China, where the virus originated. The virus has infected\u00a0at least two members of the US Congress and public figures around the world, including Prince Albert II of Monaco. The 62-year-old leader's condition is reportedly \"not worrying at all,\" and he used the announcement of his illness to remind citizens to stay home and limit contact.\u00a0 2. World economy\u00a0 Countries are pumping trillions of dollars into their economies to avoid a worldwide recession under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0In the US, Senate Republicans have unveiled a $1 trillion package that includes direct payments\u00a0for citizens under a certain income threshold and\u00a0hundreds of billions in loans to airlines and small businesses. Already,\u00a0a predicted\u00a02.25 million Americans filed initial unemployment claims this week, the highest on record. In the UK, a $400 billion deal is on the table, and the European Central Bank says it will spend more than $800 billion buying government debt and private securities to keep financial systems functioning. France also has announced a\u00a0plan to waive\u00a0some rent and utility bills\u00a0and guarantee $324 billion\u00a0worth of loans. Despite the efforts to keep the global economy above water, experts worry the stimulus deals may actually widen economic equality in the long run.\u00a0 3. Election 2020\u00a0 Tulsi Gabbard has called it\u00a0quits. The Democratic presidential candidate and congresswoman from Hawaii officially ended her campaign and endorsed Joe Biden. While Gabbard has long voiced admiration for the former vice president, it's worth noting she backed Bernie Sanders in 2016's Democratic primary. Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran, never broke through the crowded ranks of candidates, but she did have a high-profile scrap when Hillary Clinton implied Gabbard was a Russian asset. Biden also picked up an\u00a0endorsement from a former candidate in Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand. Despite early debate-stage clashes over gender roles, Gillibrand said in a statement that Biden\u00a0would be a \"champion for women and families.\" 4. Sen. Richard Burr\u00a0 Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr is facing strong criticism related to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Senate documents, Burr and his wife sold as much as $1.7 million in stock right before the outbreak's escalation\u00a0caused a sharp market decline. Two weeks later, the\u00a0North Carolina Republican issued a dire warning to attendees at a private event in Washington, according to audio obtained by NPR. His statements went completely against the position at the time of President Trump, who said the virus would likely disappear. Burr criticized NPR's reporting via\u00a0Twitter, saying the gathering was mischaracterized. Regarding the stock sales, there's no indication the sales were made on the basis of any inside information\u00a0or that Burr\u00a0broke any Senate rules by selling the stock. 5. New Delhi rape case\u00a0 Four men have been executed for the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student\u00a0in 2012 on a New Delhi bus. The case shocked the world and cast a global spotlight\u00a0on the high rates of\u00a0sexual assault in India.\u00a0The number of reported rapes has risen since the 2012 attack, potentially because of greater awareness and the perception that something will be done about reported cases. In 2018, more than 33,000 cases of alleged rape were reported in the country -- roughly 91 cases each day.\u00a0Legal reforms and more severe penalties for rape were also introduced following the woman's death.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Spring is likely to be warmer than normal across the US\u00a0 Perfect for all those responsibly distanced walks we're going to take.\u00a0 This is what scientists learned after firing a small cannonball into a near-Earth asteroid They also learned that firing a small cannonball into a near-Earth asteroid is really fun.\u00a0 Finland was named the happiest country in the world for the 3rd year in a row It's all those saunas and grand views of nature.\u00a0 Here are some literature-film combos, so you can read the book and then watch the movie\u00a0 And then be snobbishly critical about one or the other.\u00a0 Vampire bats make friends by regurgitating meals into each other's\u00a0mouths Got any tips, bats?
