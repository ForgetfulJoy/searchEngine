The singer and his touring band performed several songs from his latest album, \"Fine Line,\" including \"Adore You,\" \"Watermelon Sugar,\" \"Cherry\" and \"To Be So Lonely.\" \"I have to come into NPR more often,\" Styles said, adding that while it was hot because he was wearing the \"Wrong jumper,\" performing there was \"fun.\" He talked about his song writing process, done in England, Japan and California, explaining how he and the members of his band come up with melodies and music.
