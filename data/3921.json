Unlike the cotton variety, silk pillowcases can reduce friction on skin and hair \u2014 and with it, frizzy bedhead and those weird morning creases in our faces.  We spend (in theory) one-third of our lives against our pillows, so making this swap is one way to instantly upgrade not only our beds, but our lives. Plus, silk is nice and cooling, and just feels so darn luxurious. But silk pillowcases can be pricey, so you want to be sure you're buying ones that are a great value. And that's where we're jumping in.  Know what you're buying First off: It's really easy to mix up satin and silk.  Silk is a natural fiber and satin is a weave (the method by which fibers are made into a fabric). Satin fabric can be woven with different kinds of fibers, such as rayon, polyester, nylon and silk blends. Silk is just, well, silk. Silk costs more than satin, since it's harder to produce (you know, wrangling silkworms and all).  The fabric weight of silk is expressed as momme, or mm (the equivalent of thread count with cotton bedding.) You'll see pillowcases that range from 15 to 30 momme, with 19 about typical. Mulberry, produced by silkworms fed on mulberry leaves, is the highest quality silk, with the longest and most uniform fibers, so the fabric is uber smooth and durable.  Silk is also naturally hypoallergenic. After all, it's a substance that evolved to protect growing silkworms, and so is known to be resistant to mold, mildew, fungus and mites.  Even understanding all that, wading through the many (and we mean many) silk pillowcases on Amazon can be a bit maddening. Yes, they do all look pretty much alike. So we combed through countless comments from the most enthusiastic reviewers on Amazon to uncover the top silk pillowcase picks, all of which have at least a 4-star rating and hundreds (if not thousands) of reviews. To make comparison straightforward, all prices are for one queen-size pillowcase, unless otherwise noted. Consider your silk pillowcase shopping sorted.  Alaska Bear ($25.99; amazon.com) Consistently earning high marks from thousands of Amazon users, this 19 mm winner comes in 42 colors and prints, including ones with fun sayings.

Many folks noted in their reviews that they liked that, because it keeps the pillow from sliding. You can only sleep on one side anyway, after all. (A few did point out that had they realized the cotton side is white, they would have chosen a different one of the 11 silk colors offered.)  Many pointed to hair benefits as a major boon of this purchase. \"I even went to bed with wet hair (usually a disaster) and in the morning, I barely had to do any styling,\" one reviewer wrote. \"I will most definitely be buying more of these.\"  _______________________________________________________________________________ LuluSilk ($19.99; amazon.com) Although a relatively thin 16 mm, this bang-for-your-buck pillowcase is 100% mulberry silk on both sides and has a zipper closure so it stays on your pillow.

I have bought a few silk pillowcases, and this is definitely my favorite.\"   _______________________________________________________________________________ Mulberry Park ($22.85; amazon.com) Available in versatile white and ivory, this solid 19 mm choice is made of 100% pure organic mulberry silk. Some reviewers who didn't like hard zippers on their pillowcases lauded the \"envelope design,\" which allows the case to tuck around the pillow to keep it in place.  Others said it was a fantastic choice for quality if you are fine with white or ivory being the only color options. \"I've used this pillowcase more than eight months now,\" wrote one. \"It fits my pillow like a glove! It is holding up well. I do believe that using this pillowcase has helped stop hair breakage and improved the skin on my face.\"  _______________________________________________________________________________ Myk ($23.99; amazon.com) This standout is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 Certified, which means the fabric is free of harmful chemicals.

One reviewer, who called it \"a superb pillowcase at a great price,\" continued by saying, \"It seems a lot more expensive than it is. I hand washed it with a delicate silk wash and let it air dry before cool ironing it. It came out lovely. It's very comfortable, and I wake up with softer skin and much less frizzy "], "Language": false}
