The southern Italian region of Calabria will begin phase two of the relaxation of emergency coronavirus restrictions on Thursday, Gov. Jole Santelli said, signing an order to allow communities to embark on a gradual reopening.\u00a0 \u201cStarting tomorrow, the reopening of bars, bakeries, restaurants and pizzerias \u2014 where tables can be out in the open \u2014 will be consented,\u201d Santelli said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cMovements within your municipality, or to another municipality for individual sports, are allowed\u2026the activity of open-air markets is allowed, including street vending,\u201d she added.\u00a0 According to the Italian Civil Protection Agency, the region has registered one coronavirus-related death in total. \u201cCalabrians have shown a civic sense and respect for the rules in recent weeks. It is right that, today, the region puts their trust in them. They will be able to demonstrate common sense in managing the new open spaces that the region has decided to allow,\u201d Santelli said. A total of 12.4 million workers in Italy have asked for emergency funds offered by the government through the \"Cura Italia\" (Heal Italy) decree.\u00a0 As of Monday, the National Social Security Institute (INPS) said in a tweet it has received 4,740,000 applications for the 600 euros ($652) Covid-19 indemnity, and\u00a07,730,493 others applied for the wage guarantee funds and for the \"ordinary check,\" INPS said Tuesday in a statement. These funds were introduced by the Heal Italy decree on March 17 to \u201csupport workers and companies, with the aim that no one will lose their jobs due to the emergency,\" the government said on its website. According to a study by INPS and the Bank of Italy, two-thirds of the 600 euro indemnities were paid out to self-employed workers, and 15.4% to temporary workers. The average age of payees is 46. This\u00a0600 euros indemnity was created for self-employed workers and freelancers who are \"almost 5 million people,\" the Ministry of Economy and Finance said in a statement. According to INP, the regions most affected by the payment flow were Lombardy (North Italy), Puglia and Sicily (South Italy), which received almost a third of the subsidies, followed\u00a0by Emilia Romagna, Veneto (North Italy) and Campania (South Italy). \u00a0 Spain, one of the world\u2019s top\u00a0travel\u00a0destinations, should not fully restart its tourism industry until the European Union reopens its internal and external borders, a senior Spanish government official said on Wednesday. \u201cA big part of our economy depends on the movements of international visitors and of Spaniards,\u201d said the official. \u201cBut we have to have a health system that can take care of anyone who\u2019s in Spain. That\u2019s the fundamental issue.\u201d Some 200 German owners of holiday homes on Spain\u2019s Mediterranean islands such as Mallorca and Ibiza, wrote to the regional president this month, requesting they be allowed back to their properties as soon as Spain\u2019s lockdown is lifted.  A spokesperson for the Balearic regional government president, Francina Armengol, provided CNN with a copy of the reply she sent to the German homeowners, saying that Spain is working on reopening, but its first priority is \u201cthe safety of people and avoiding the expansion of the virus.\u201d Spain has the second highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, after the United States.  Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Spain was the world\u2019s second biggest international tourist destination, with 83 million visitors, just behind France, the UN\u2019s World Tourism Organization reported for 2018, the most recent figures available. The Covid-19 outbreak served a blow to Spain\u2019s tourism sector, which is 12.3% of GDP and accounts for 2.6 million jobs, according to the Tourism Ministry. \u00a0 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that while the food supply chain in Canada faces challenges, he will not force meat processing plants to remain open as President Trump has done. \u201cThe priority for us is both things; keeping people safe and ensuring a good supply of food to Canadians, we will make sure we\u2019re doing them both,\u201d Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Wednesday. Canada is facing several Covid-19 outbreaks in meat-processing plants across the country. The most serious situation is in Alberta where two large meat processing plants providing as much at 70% of beef products in Canada have suffered outbreaks. Cargill shut a large processing plant in High River, Alberta, on April 20\u00a0after an employee died of the virus and hundreds more were infected.\u00a0With more than 700 cases of Covid-19, the Cargill plant is the country\u2019s largest single-site outbreak of the virus.\u00a0 JBS is operating another meat processing plant in Alberta on reduced hours after dozens were infected at its facility. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The World Health Organization (WHO) said it is aware of the United Kingdom report about a small number of children with the\u00a0inflammatory response to Covid-19.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead for the coronavirus response said, \u201cWe're looking at this with our clinical network, and in fact our clinical network had a teleconference yesterday which discussed this.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThere are some recent rare descriptions of children in some European countries that have had this inflammatory syndrome, which is similar to the Kawasaki Syndrome, but it seems to be very rare,\u201d Van Kerkhove said. Dr. Mike Ryan,\u00a0executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies program, said clinicians are looking into what is \u201ccausing the inflammation that attacks tissue, other than lung tissue.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe've seen this in the past with many emerging diseases. They don't necessarily only attack one type of tissue; there can be multiple organs affected and many of you have seen the reports of other organs that have been affected with this disease,\u201d Ryan said. \u00a0##Health## One of the first carefully done studies of the antiviral drug remdesivir shows it did not help people recover faster from coronavirus infections. But the study, conducted in China, may have been too small to show clearly whether the drug helps. The findings of the Chinese study conflict with other hints of the drug\u2019s efficacy coming from other trials\u00a0\u2013 two of them also on Wednesday. One study was from the company that makes the drug and a third study from the National Institutes of Health is expected later on Wednesday. Experts say it\u2019s going to take a lot more testing and a little longer before it\u2019s clear whether remdesivir can help patients recover from Covid-19 infections. The study conducted in China was stopped early because there weren\u2019t enough patients, but it indicated that the drug did not work as hoped, the team reported in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday. Some details of this study were posted last week on the World Health Organization\u2019s website, then removed. Gilead said earlier on Wednesday that its own study of the drug showed it may work and that patients who took the drug for five days or 10 days saw similar results. Gilead\u2019s study results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The study done in China was more carefully designed than Gilead\u2019s study to show whether the drug was helping patients. The Lancet study was a randomized, placebo controlled study \u2013 meaning that patients were randomly given the drug or a dummy\u00a0treatment\u00a0and the patients and doctors did not know who was getting what. The team at\u00a0China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China tested the drug using 237 coronavirus patients in Wuhan. \u201cUnfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,\u201d Bin Cao, the researcher who led the study, said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cFuture studies need to determine whether earlier treatment with remdesivir, higher doses, or combination with other antivirals or SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, might be more effective in those with severe illness,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The study may not tell anything meaningful. Larger studies enrolling more people, and conducted with careful controls will be needed to tell whether various treatments work. \u201cThe study was well designed\u2014a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter randomized trial\u2014and well conducted, with high protocol adherence and no loss-to-follow up,\u201d John Norrie of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary. \u201cWe eagerly await the ongoing trials.\u201d \u00a0 At least 27,682 people with Covid-19 have now died in Italy since the beginning of the crisis, data from the Italian Civil Protection Agency showed Wednesday. The number of active cases in the country stands at 104,657. The total number of cases in Italy, including deaths and recoveries, is now 203,591. More than 20,000 health workers have been infected with coronavirus, according to the National Institute for Health. At least 153 doctors have died of coronavirus, according to the Association of Doctors. \u00a0##Health## The number of confirmed deaths from coronavirus in Brazil surpassed 5,000, according to the latest numbers released by the country\u2019s health ministry Tuesday. President Jair Bolsonaro was questioned by reporters about the spike in the death toll during a late night press gaggle outside the presidential residence in Brasilia Tuesday. Bolsonaro responded, \"So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?\" He added that even though his middle name is \u201cMessias,\u201d which translates to Messiah in English, he\u2019s not \u201ca miracle worker.\u201d He later walked back the comments during the same press conference, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus. We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones, many of whom were elderly. But that\u2019s life, it could be me tomorrow.\u201d Bolsonaro has dismissed the threats of the pandemic, calling it a \u201clittle flu\u201d and defying stay-at-home orders imposed by governors by participating in rallies with supporters and hugging people in local supermarkets and bakeries. Support for Bolsonaro has eroded amid the pandemic, but according to a poll conducted by Datafolha, 33% of Brazilians still think he is doing a \"good job,\" compared with 38% who think he is doing a \"terrible job\" or 26% who think his performance is average. The Swiss government will further loosen coronavirus-related restrictions as of May 11. Shops, cultural and sports institutions, and restaurants will be allowed to open at that date, Switzerland's Federal President Simonetta Sommaruga said at a press conference in Bern. Primary and secondary schools can also open as of May 11, Alain Berset from the federal council said at the press conference. Border restrictions will be eased and public transport will also ramp up at this time.  A third phase of loosening restrictions will happen June 8, under the condition that the coronavirus spread is under control. Spain is working to ease restrictions in the country and officials defined what the \"new normal\" will look like as the number of new coronavirus cases continues to fall. Relaxation of Spain's confinement measures, which have been Europe's strictest,\u00a0will be lifted gradually and in phases, Spain\u2019s Director for Health Emergencies Fernando Sim\u00f3n and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.\u00a0 Small parts of the country will start phase one of easing restrictions on Monday, with the rest joining in May 11.\u00a0This phase will see some small businesses start operating and allow for individual exercise as well as professional sports training to resume.\u00a0Senior citizens will also be permitted to go outside in \u2018Phase One\u2019. Deescalation is expected to be complete by the end of June, according to the prime minister.\u00a0 \u201cThe better we apply the guidelines and the rules [as set out by the government transition plan] to reduce the transmission risk, the better and faster we can move from one phase to the other\u201d, Sim\u00f3n said today at the government\u2019s daily scientific and technical briefing. When asked about the use of masks, Sim\u00f3n said in most cases, it is recommended, but not mandatory.\u00a0 \u201cNot everyone can wear a mask. People with respiratory problems, with anxiety, athletes will not be able to use it, with children it\u2019s not easy\u201d he explained.\u00a0\u201cA rule about the mandatory use of masks, with all these exceptions, is complicated,\" he said. Spain is the country with the second highest number of coronavirus infections in the world, suffering from a great economic and social toll from the pandemic. ##Daily Life## Dr. Lorna Breen was not struggling with any emotional difficulties or problems with stress before being on the front lines of battling a pandemic, her father says. The New York City emergency room doctor who recovered from Covid-19 and continued to treat\u00a0coronavirus patients died a hero, he says. The 49-year-old's father, Dr. Philip Breen, spoke to CNN's Chris Cuomo Tuesday. \"She was a doctor, every bit of the word that a doctor should be,\" Breen said. \"She put her life on the line to take care of other people. She was in the trenches, so to speak, right in the front line as people were dying left and right around her.\" Breen said his daughter contracted the virus and stayed home for just over a week, which in hindsight, he feels wasn't enough time.\u00a0 \"I think she felt an overwhelming sense of wanting to help her colleagues and her friends who were still fighting the good fight, and so she strapped on her harness and took the bit in her mouth and she went back,\" Breen said. \"I talked to her just before her final 12-hour shift. And during the time she was on that shift, she basically went down in the traces like a horse that had pulled too heavy a load and couldn't go a step further and just went down.\" Breen said his daughter was hospitalized until she was determined to be well enough to be out on her own, but she was \"clearly not better.\" \"As of Sunday, she took her own life because I think she was tired and she was the kind of person, as somebody has very aptly put it, she was like the fireman who runs into the burning building to save another life and doesn't regard anything about herself. So she has paid the price and she's been in the trenches,\" Breen said. How to get help:\u00a0In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

In a meeting of the government\u2019s coordinating council for combating the spread of coronavirus, Mishustin said: It is still impossible to give an exact date when the restrictions imposed due to coronavirus can be completely removed, including at the borders of the Russian Federation.\u201d The Russian government previously barred entry to foreigners through April 30 to halt the spread of coronavirus, but Mishustin said he had signed a government decree extending border closings \u201cuntil the fight against infection is complete and the epidemiological situation improves,\u201d although he did not give further specifics. Mishustin added that some exceptions would be granted to specialists who maintain specialized equipment needed for manufacturing essential items to fight coronavirus. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## The post quarantine school year could see changes such as staggering start times, modified recess times, and no cafeteria for lunch period, said California Governor Gavin Newsom in a taped interview on NBC\u2019s Today show In order to get the economy going, parents must get back to work, he said. \"It's not back to normal, it's modified,\" he said.  He warned that people needed to take the next phase seriously to avoid a second wave of infections, after crowds packed beaches over the weekend. \"I'm worried we can erase all the gains in a very short period of time,\" he added. The federal government has been responsive to the state\u2019s requests and does not want to politicize this dire situation because so many lives are at risk. The Governor emphasizes his reliance on data and reiterated the importance of taking guidelines seriously. He pointed to the packed beaches over the weekend and cautioned that the virus does not take a vacation; if people are not careful, the state could face a second wave of cases. ##Daily Life## Every Sunday since the coronavirus lockdown started, Stephanie Anstey drives 20 minutes from her home in Grottoes, Virginia, to sit in her school's near-empty parking lot and type away on her laptop. Anstey, a middle school history teacher, lives in a valley between two mountains, where the only available home internet option is a satellite connection. Her emails can take 30 seconds to load, only to quit mid-message. She can't even open files on Google Drive, let alone upload lesson modules or get on a Zoom call with colleagues. \"You just have to plan,\" Anstey said. \"It's not a Monday through Friday job anymore.\"\u00a0 So Anstey's new office is in her car in the corner of the parking lot where the WiFi signal is strongest. She comes here\u00a0when she needs to upload instructional videos, answer emails from students and parents or participate in the occasional video conferencing call. It's not ideal, she says, but using her slow internet at home is even more frustrating.\u00a0 Anstey's predicament casts a new light on a longstanding digital divide that is being made even starker by the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 More than 18 million Americans -- about 5.6% of the US population -- lack access to high-speed internet,\u00a0according to the Federal Communications Commission. (Many technology experts dispute the agency's figures --\u00a0the company BroadbandNow\u00a0says the real number is more than double that.) Pockets of poor connectivity can be found in both small towns and cities, particularly in\u00a0low-income urban areas. But those living in rural areas and\u00a0tribal lands\u00a0are\u00a0especially likely\u00a0to have slower speeds,\u00a0spottier coverage\u00a0and fewer internet service providers to choose from -- forcing people like Anstey to travel to cafes, libraries and parking lots for a reliable connection.

He's sitting at his desk now working away.\u00a0 \"We try and do something for all our charities most days to try and give them a bit of encouragement and just try to lend our support.\" Read more: ##Daily Life## Eighty-five National Health Service (NHS) staff and 23 social care workers in the UK have died from coronavirus, says the country\u2019s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. \u201cMy deepest sympathies are with their families and their friends at what is an incredibly difficult time. And we will continue to do whatever it takes to support them,\u201d Raab told the House of Commons, the lower house in the UK parliament. The government has faced criticism from many frontline workers over a lack of personal protective equipment. The UK has recorded more than 160,000 coronavirus cases and almost 22,000 deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. ##Health## General Electric's turnaround has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0The conglomerate said Wednesday it burned through $2.2 billion of cash during the first quarter as its jet engine business got slammed by a \"rapid decline\" in global commercial aviation demand in March.\u00a0 GE estimated the health crisis wiped out about $900 million of its earnings and hit free cash flow by around $1 billion.\u00a0 \"The impact from Covid-19 materially challenged our first-quarter results, especially in Aviation, where we saw a dramatic decline in commercial aerospace as the virus spread globally in March,\" CEO Larry Culp said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to the crisis, GE was enjoying a comeback driven by efforts to slim down its portfolio, clean up its balance sheet and generate free cash flow by improving its operations. Even GE's critics credited Culp with saving the company from disaster.\u00a0 Yet GE's industrial free cash flow burn rate nearly doubled during the first quarter as the pandemic struck. Its adjusted profit dropped by a deeper-than-feared 62%.\u00a0 Earnings at GE's aviation, financial services and renewable energy divisions all fell. GE Power swung to a loss of $129 million. The only division to grow its bottom line was GE Healthcare, which makes MRI machines, CT scans and other medical equipment.\u00a0\u00a0 ##Business## The world is learning to live with less oil. It may never look back.\u00a0 The coronavirus pandemic has\u00a0destroyed demand\u00a0for gasoline and jet fuel\u00a0as billions of people stay home, and there's no guarantee it will ever fully recover despite rock-bottom prices.\u00a0 The oil industry is bracing for the effects of the crisis to linger.\u00a0Employees\u00a0keep working from home. International travel stays scarce. And citizens in once-polluted cities, having become accustomed to blue skies, demand tougher emissions controls. Such changes would come on top of a push for investors\u00a0to dump oil assets\u00a0that had been gaining momentum before the\u00a0recent price crash. Sustainable energy investments, by comparison,\u00a0appear to have held up relatively well despite stock market volatility. This\u00a0could mean that global demand never returns to its 2019 record high, a scary prospect for oil companies and their employees from Texas to Western Europe, and countries such as Russia, Nigeria or Iraq that depend heavily on selling crude. \"I think the pressure to accelerate the forces driving the energy transition will only increase as a result of this crisis,\" said Mark Lewis, global head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Paris. The threat of a second wave of infections in the fall also looms for producers. Prices have already plunged to their\u00a0lowest levels in decades\u00a0as producers grapple with excess supply and the worst demand shock in history. \"There remains an exceptional level of uncertainty regarding the near-term outlook for prices and product demand,\"\u00a0BP\u00a0Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told analysts this week. Before the pandemic, analysts predicted that the peak in oil demand would occur around 2040 due to the rise of electric cars, increased energy efficiency and a switch to alternative sources. But the coronavirus has forced many\u00a0assumptions about the future of oil to be scrubbed.

We hope we will not need to\u00a0extend the travel warning\u00a0beyond\u00a0the 14\u00a0June,\u00a0however\u00a0we cannot make this\u00a0judgement at this moment in time,\" he added. Maas issued Germany's official warning against tourist travel around the world on March 17. The foreign minister said Germany had repatriated 240,000 tourists from all over the world to Germany in the\u00a0last four weeks, adding: ''We won't be running another one of these (repatriations) this\u00a0summer.\" ##Travel## Juventus striker Paulo Dybala has tested positive for the coronavirus for the fourth time in six weeks, a source close to the player has told CNN. The source said: \u201cHe is doing well now, he has no symptoms and is even training. Now he is waiting for the results of the latest two swabs.\u201d Dybala has to respect the healthcare system and the time it takes. He is a soccer player and doesn't get preferential treatment,\" the source added. It is unclear, though, when each of Dybala\u2019s tests took place CNN has contacted Juventus for comment. The Argentine striker announced on Instagram on Saturday 21 March that he and his girlfriend Oriana Sabatini had contracted Covid-19 after his first test. On Friday, March 27, Dybala spoke to Juventus\u2019 official YouTube account about his experience of contracting the disease: \u201cI developed strong symptoms, but today I already feel much better. \u201cNow I can move better, walking and trying to train. I could hardly breathe, I couldn\u2019t do anything after five minutes. My muscles ached. Fortunately, Oriana and I are better now.\u201d Dybala was one of three Juventus stars to contract the virus, along with Italian defender Daniele Rugani and French midfielder Blaise Matuidi. The club announced earlier this month that both Rugani and Matuidi had made full recoveries after their swab tests came back with negative results. ##Health## Europe\u2019s biggest planemaker, Airbus, has reported a huge loss as coronavirus hits its business. The firm reported a net loss of \u20ac481 million ($522 million) for the first three months of the year compared to a profit of \u20ac40 million ($43 million) for the same period last year, the company said in its results Wednesday. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes fell 49% and revenues declined 15% year on year, as it delivered 40 fewer aircraft than a year earlier. We are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known,\u201d said Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury.  In an internal letter to employees last week he had warned the company is \u201cbleeding cash.\u201d\u00a0 Rival Boeing is reporting earnings later today. ##Travel## ##Business## A German company working with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has begun human trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine that could supply millions by the end of the year, according to the two firms. Pfizer says it will begin testing the experimental vaccine in the United States as early as next week, and says\u00a0a vaccine could be ready for emergency use in the fall, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.  Mainz-based BioNTech reported that the first cohort of participants had been given doses of the potential vaccine, BNT162, in a Phase 1/2 clinical study in Germany. Twelve study participants have been vaccinated with the vaccine candidate BNT162 in Germany since the start of the study on April 23, 2020,\" the company said in a statement.  No information on the results is currently available.\u00a0BioNTech said around 200 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years old would be given doses ranging from 1\u00b5g (microgram) to 100\u00b5g to find the optimal dose for further studies.  \"In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be investigated,\" added the biotech company. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to initiate trials for BNT162 in the US upon regulatory approval, expected shortly, the statement said. The German Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Drugs approved the trial -- the country's first clinical trial for a vaccine against Covid 19 -- on April 22. \"The two companies plan to jointly conduct clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine candidates initially in Europe and the U.S., across multiple research sites,\" Pfizer announced in its first quarter report, published online Tuesday. \"The companies estimate that there is potential to supply millions of vaccine doses by the end of 2020, subject to technical success of the development program and approval by regulatory authorities, and the potential to rapidly scale up the capacity to produce hundreds of millions of doses in 2021.\" Pfizer isn't the only group with a potential Covid-19 vaccine in the works. Last week, scientists at Oxford University's Jenner Institute in the United Kingdom began testing its vaccine on humans Thursday and, depending on the trial results, could be ready as early as September.\u00a0Officials say that more than a half-dozen vaccine programs are in the clinical trial phase and more than 80 are in preliminary phases. ##Health## Beijing will lower its coronavirus emergency response from the highest level starting on April 30,\u00a0according to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.\u00a0The capital will move from the country\u2019s highest designation of \u201clevel one\u201d to \u201clevel two,\u201d out of a three-tier system. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Beijing Municipal Health Commission said that despite the downgrading of the emergency response level, prevention and control work will not be relaxed.  Under the lowered emergency response level travellers arriving in Beijing from \u201clow-risk areas\u201d within China will no longer have to be quarantined for two weeks upon arrival and people staying in hotels in Beijing will no longer have to undergo nucleic acid testing. However, the Commission added that the 14-day quarantine still applies to all international travellers arriving in Beijing from overseas, according to state-run CGTN. Beijing has not reported any new cases of locally transmitted Covid-19 for 13 days. ##Health## ##Daily Life## ##Travel## The Southern California city of Newport Beach voted on Tuesday in a City Council meeting to keep its beaches open. But additional reinforcements will enforce social distancing to protect against the coronavirus pandemic. An ordinance was proposed to close the city's beaches for the next three weekends to avoid the overcrowding seen this past weekend, but council members did not end up voting directly on the agenda items during the meeting. Instead, Councilman Kevin Muldoon made an alternate motion to deny the item, which passed on a 5-2 vote, according to the city's public information manager. Increased police and lifeguard presence will actively enforce social distancing. The majority of the city's council members expressed a strong desire to keep most public beaches, parks and open spaces accessible for the mental health and physical well-being of residents, according to a statement.\u00a0  The vote comes as many states prepare to begin loosening restrictions and\u00a0phase out stay-at-home\u00a0orders.

It warned that profit for the full year would be considerably below 2019, but still positive. Volkswagen, which also owns the Audi, Porsche and Seat brands, said group vehicle sales fell 25% to 1.9 million.\u00a0Deliveries to customers were down 23% at 2 million.  \"The global Covid-19 pandemic substantially impacted our business in the first quarter. We've taken numerous countermeasures to cut costs and ensure liquidity and we continue to be robustly positioned financially,\" Volkswagen's chief financial officer Frank Witter said in a statement. \"The Volkswagen Group is steering through this unprecedented crisis with focus and determination,\" he added. Carmakers have had to contend with a slump in demand for vehicles and huge disruption to their operations, as measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic shut down factories and keep customers at home.\u00a0Ford\u00a0on Tuesday posted a\u00a0$1.9 billion loss\u00a0for the first quarter, warning that this would balloon to $5 billion in the current quarter.

Most countries have taken measures to protect against the spread of Covid-19 \u2014 enforcing stay-at-home orders, closing nonessential businesses and advising people to wear protective gear and keep a safe distance from one another. Many of those guidelines still apply. But beaches are beginning to reopen. Some students are returning to classrooms. Stores are opening their doors for the first time in several weeks. It remains to be seen whether these relaxations might lead to an increase in cases. But life is far from returning to normal.

Everyone else in the building was, according to reporters who were traveling with him. After all, it has been the policy at the renowned Rochester, Minnesota, facility since April 13. They even say they'll provide one. Pence was told of the new rules before he visited, the clinic said on Twitter, a post that was subsequently deleted. \"Mayo Clinic had informed @VP of the masking policy prior to his arrival today,\" it had written. But as he visited a blood and plasma donation center inside the building, Pence was bare-faced. Others in the room -- including Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration head -- wore coverings. Pence did avoid shaking hands; he elbow-bumped instead with doctors and officials.

Two decades ago, the country's health minister announced that beetroot or garlic could treat HIV/AIDS. South Africa's President\u00a0Thabo Mbeki at the time falsely claimed\u00a0that HIV treatments could be poisonous, so he kept proven, life-saving antiretrovirals (ARVs) from those in need. In all, South Africa's official AIDS denials and misinformation cost the lives of more than 300,000 people, according to several studies. \"We can't have a large number of people dying,\" Dr. Yogan Pillay, a senior official at the Department of Health, said. \"We came from a period where we had large numbers of South Africans dying from HIV. We can't repeat that now and we shouldn't.\" It is the memory of that past failure, South African health officials say, that is driving their fight against this new virus and it is the considerable resources they have since built up against HIV, that could provide their best weapon in fighting Covid-19.

College students Yolian Ogbu and Victory Nwabufo have teamed up with the\u00a0National Children's Campaign\u00a0to launch a movement demanding universal hazard pay and personal protective equipment for all coronavirus essential employees in the US. And it's all happening virtually under the hashtag\u00a0#YourWorkersMyFamily. The\u00a0US Department of Labor\u00a0defines hazard pay as \"additional pay for performing hazardous duty or work\" that is \"not adequately alleviated by protective devices.\"\u00a0New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u00a0proposed last week that hazard pay for frontline workers be included in a federal stimulus plan. Ogbu and Nwabufo said their effort has garnered support from essential workers, their families, unions and organizations.

Because they both had the disease, they were able to stay together in their last moments -- something most coronavirus patients can't do with their loved ones. Family members across the nation have had to say their final goodbyes over FaceTime or in texts read as overwhelmed medical institutions have restricted visitors to help slow the virus's spread.  The couple, who had been together for 73 years, had beds next to each other and got to say \"I love you\" to each other one last time before they died Saturday, their granddaughter Natalie Lameka told the affiliate.\u00a0 \"They had been holding hands and that was just heartbreaking to hear but also heartwarming to hear. And we were just so thankful they were together and were aware they were together,\" Lameka said. The two were like the family's \"glue that holds us together,\" their granddaughter said, and while losing them hurts, knowing they never had to part makes the pain a little easier.\u00a0 \"It was definitely hard,\" she told the news station. \"But it was bittersweet.\" Mary Kepler died six hours after her husband, the affiliate reported.

Now under the coronavirus lockdown, she says she is also fighting to find the few foods she considers \"safe\" to eat. Her treatment program was closed down for 12 weeks after the UK government announced its lockdown. She says, without that help, \"I'm just having to wing it at home by myself.\" \"I feel like I've had a big chunk of my treatment stolen from me,\" Lisette said.  The coronavirus pandemic has left Lisette and many others suffering with eating disorders facing new challenges and exacerbated pre-existing problems for others.\u00a0 Support groups estimate that some\u00a01.25 million\u00a0people in the UK are living with an eating disorder. In the US, that number could be as high as\u00a030 million. Eating disorder charities in the US and UK say they've seen significant increases in people contacting their services during the lockdowns.  \"Everyone who is contacting us is talking about coronavirus and how that's impacting their eating disorders,\" says Tom Quinn, spokesperson for UK eating disorder charity\u00a0Beat.

Hong Kong airport has provided a glimpse into what international airport procedures might look like once we're traveling again -- and a lot of disinfection technologies are involved. Officials at the Asian destination's international airport claim it is the first in the world to trial a live operation of CLeanTech, a full-body disinfection booth. How it works: Those passing through undertake a temperature check before entering a booth for the 40-second disinfection and sanitizing procedures. The individual is also sprinkled with sanitizing spray for \"instant disinfection\" inside the booth, which is kept under negative pressure, to prevent cross-contamination. Kills viruses on clothing: According to the airport authority, the inside of the facility contains an antimicrobial coating that can remotely kill any viruses and/or bacteria found on clothing, and the body, by using photocatalyst advances along with \"nano needles.\" Is it in operation? While CLeanTech is at present only being used on staff who undertake public health and quarantine duties for passenger arrivals, the fact that it's being trialed at one of the world's busiest airports suggests facilities like this may be used more widely in the near future.

But the South Korean conglomerate also says the crisis has sparked a\u00a0fundamental change in how people live -- and predicted that the world's reliance on digital services is here to stay as millions of people hunker down at home.\u00a0 The company on Wednesday reported operating profit of 6.45 trillion won ($5.3 billion) for the three-month period ending in March, up 3.5% compared to the same period a year earlier and\u00a0in line with analysts' expectations. Revenue rose 5.6% to 55.3 trillion won ($45.4 billion). Net profit slid 3.2% to 4.88 trillion won ($4 billion). Last quarter's uptick might be short lived, though, and the company warned that the pandemic is already causing uncertainties for large parts of its business.

The annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body, is usually held in early March. This year, it was postponed for the first time due to the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement is a symbolic display of confidence by Beijing that it has successfully contained the coronavirus, which was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December. The highly choreographed meeting of the rubber-stamp parliament will see nearly 3,000 delegates from around the country gathered in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, unveiling the country's key economic targets, approving budgets, and passing legislation in sessions that last for about 10 days. Allowing thousands of people to travel to the Chinese capital and sit side by side for days in an indoor setting would have been unthinkable two months ago, when much of the country was under varying types of restrictive lockdown measures intended to stop the fast-spreading virus. Beneath the surface, however, fears about a potential second wave of infections remain high.\u00a0 Read the full story:  ##Daily Life## Travelers will be welcome to visit Greece this summer but social distancing rules will remain in place to keep people safe from coronavirus, Greek tourism minister Harry Theocharis said. \u201cWe do want people to come to Greece,\u201d he told BBC Radio. \u201cOf course we will take precautions in terms of the requirements before travelling but also in terms of the way that we travel, the way that we stay.

Britain\u2019s National Health Service sent an\u00a0alert to doctors Sunday saying they had seen cases of atypical Kawasaki disease that could be linked to coronavirus. A team at\u00a0Stanford Children\u2019s Hospital\u00a0said they had, also. They described the case of a\u00a06-month-old girl admitted to the hospital with the disease and later also diagnosed with coronavirus. What is Kawasaki disease? It's a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of the blood vessels in the body to become inflamed and can limit blood flow to the heart. It is usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems, but it can be deadly.  What causes it? No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease, but some studies have pointed to a link between viruses or a bacterial infection. The US case: The child was initially diagnosed with a viral infection, the Stanford team said, and later tested positive for Covid-19. On the second day she had a fever and a blotchy rash. A chest x-ray showed a small white spot in her mid-lung, the team reported\u00a0in the journal Hospital Pediatrics. The baby\u2019s symptoms appeared to be Kawasaki disease and she was treated. Two weeks after she was discharged, the baby had no respiratory symptoms and is doing well. Further research: The authors of the study suggest that since the coronavirus is new, and not all symptoms in children are known, scientists will want to further research the potential association of Kawasaki Disease with Covid-19. Dr. Brad Segal, who worked on the case, said the team was surprised when the test came back positive for Covid-19. \u201cIn hindsight, looking at it, it\u2019s not entirely shocking that this association was possible,\u201d he said, adding that Kawasaki disease itself is often preceded by a respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. Segal doesn\u2019t believe they have seen any other cases of Kawasaki associated with coronavirus at his hospital. He thinks that if this is a complication associated with the coronavirus then it is most likely uncommon. \u201cI don\u2019t, though, think we are going to see a wave of these cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that families, even if they have coronavirus really need to worry about, based on what we know so far.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is going to be a subset, of a subset, of a subset of individuals who develop it,\u201d Segal said. \u201cAs far as we can tell, this is something exceedingly uncommon.\u201d \u00a0For further explanation of Kawasaki disease, read our coverage here: ##Health## Three months in -- after a million infections, nearly 60,000 US deaths and a potential economic depression -- it's still unclear whether US President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0grasps the gravity of the\u00a0coronavirus crisis. Trump's leadership in the worst domestic crisis since World War II has consistently featured wrong, ill-informed and dangerous decisions, omissions and politically fueled pivots. \"Many very good experts, very good people too, said this would never affect the United States,\" Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday. \"The experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong and a lot of people didn't know it would be this serious.\" Such comments are typical of Trump's consistent habit of blaming others for his own poor judgments. For the record, senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official\u00a0Nancy Messonnier\u00a0warned on February 27 that it was inevitable the disease would reach the US and could be \"bad.\" The President's deflections on Tuesday are typical of his wider political method of evading responsibility by bending the truth and of creating distractions. But in the depths of the current disorientating times, the deeper liabilities of the President's political approach are being exposed. A hostility to details, a resistance to accepting the advice of experts and for learning the messy intricacies of a crisis that interrupted his own narrative in election year. Read the full analysis: More than 6,000 people have now died of Covid-19-related symptoms in Germany, the country's center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute, said today. At least 202 people died in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 6,115. The country is seen as one of the most successful in dealing with the pandemic because it has managed to keep its death toll relatively low in relation to confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed infections now stands at 157,641, while around 120,400 people have recovered. Virus reproduction rates: Germany also managed to slow down the reproduction rate of  infections to 0.9 after it rose to 1 on Tuesday.  That means every person infected in Germany on average is infecting less than one other person and the virus is being pushed back.\u00a0 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has previously warned that if the number -- also known as the R0 value -- rises above 1, the country\u2019s health system would eventually be overwhelmed.\u00a0 Face masks: The new numbers come after the city state of Berlin became the final jurisdiction in Germany to make wearing face coverings in stores mandatory.  Avoiding a new surge: Merkel and top virologists have warned the country risks a new spike in infections if physical distancing measured are relaxed too much. \u00a0##Health## A new study may support the idea that men get sicker and are more likely to die from coronavirus than women. It\u2019s a small study, done in China, and does not necessarily reflect what has happened elsewhere in the world. But it supports an early observation about Covid-19 when it first started spreading in China: men were more likely to die than women.\u00a0 The method: A team at\u00a0Beijing Tongren Hospital and Wuhan Union Hospital studied 43 patients directly and the records of just over 1,000 others. What they found: Men and women seemed to get the disease at the same rate, but men were more than twice as likely to die, the team found. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, gives little other detail. People who were older and those with more underlying health conditions fared worse than younger and healthier patients, the researchers found. More research needed: The authors concluded that the male gender is a risk factor for worse outcomes of Covid-19, regardless of age and underlying health conditions. They said this will need to be studied with a larger group of patients to determine if it is accurate, although some earlier studies have noted a similar trend.\u00a0 Other factors could be at play: Scientists will also want to look at data from patients in other countries since there are demographic elements that could be a factor. In China, for example, 50% of men smoke, compared to 5% of women, according to earlier research, and smoking is thought to be tied to more severe cases of the disease. The study also does not explain why men fare worse with this disease. ##Health## Police in\u00a0New Zealand\u00a0enforced crowd control measures at a popular fast food outlet after large numbers of people rushed to buy burgers following a relaxing of the country's lockdown measures. The country eased into level 3 restrictions on Monday and for many, it was a chance to finally eat the fast food they had been craving.  Long lines for take-out: Under the new restrictions, limited number of restaurants and cafes have been permitted to reopen. According to state-owned broadcaster TVNZ, that resulted in long queues of cars at KFC and McDonald's \"drive-thru\" outlets in Auckland, the country's biggest city.\u00a0 And at one Auckland burger joint, the crowds were so large that the police were called. \"Day one of re-opening saw our BurgerFuel stores inundated with a stampede of customers, way beyond what we had anticipated,\" a spokesperson for BurgerFuel said in a statement. Breaking the rules: New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said police had recorded 104 breaches in the first 18 hours of the level 4 rules being lifted.

Local administrations in two states bordering Andhra Pradesh state have built walls and trenches to prevent cars and people crossing state lines as concerns mount over rising cases of the virus amid a nationwide lockdown. Andhra Pradesh has reported at least 1,259 cases, including 31 deaths. The pregnant woman, from a remote tribal area of Andhra Pradesh, had been referred to a specialist hospital in neighboring Odisha state, where an ambulance was waiting for her. But the trench prevented her from walking across the state border, according to Saikanth Varma, a project officer with the Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare department. \"Barricades are in place at all border checkpoints as only essential goods and services can cross the border during the lockdown. However, the local municipality in charge of manning this checkpoint was overenthusiastic and dug a trench as well,\u201d\u00a0Varma said. The Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare department has raised the issue with district officials in Odisha who have told the local body to immediately fill the trench. The woman gave birth to a healthy baby and is currently in isolation as a precaution. Border walls: At Andhra Pradesh\u2019s southern border, three walls ranging from 3 feet to 6 feet high were built along the border with Tamil Nadu state to control traffic amid the lockdown. A temporary wall built on Sunday was removed the next day, said Ganesh Shekhar, sub-collector of Vellore district in Tamil Nadu. The decision to build the walls was taken by local district officials and not by the state government, Shekhar added. India lockdown: On March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a three-week nationwide lockdown, which has since been extended until May 3. Modi is yet to make an official announcement on a further extension. Several chief ministers are in favor of an extension following a video conference with Modi on Monday, according to CNN affiliate News 18. ##Daily Life## In a small pilot study, researchers are exploring whether\u00a0low-dose chest\u00a0radiation\u00a0therapy may improve lung function in certain critically ill Covid-19 patients, according to a news release from the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta.\u00a0 \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic inspired us to think outside the box, and we\u2019ve been working with our intensivist colleagues to launch this trial because of its potential to help patients who are desperately ill,\u201d said Dr. Mohammad Khan, an associate professor in the department of\u00a0radiation oncology in the Emory University school of medicine and a co-principal investigator on the study, in the release.\u00a0 There are currently five critically ill patients enrolled in the phase I/II clinical trial, with an additional five patients to be added in another group.\u00a0Those enrolled are given a single treatment of low-dose chest\u00a0radiation\u00a0and are followed through a one-week observational period. Century-old idea: The study was inspired by the historical use of chest\u00a0radiation\u00a0to treat pneumonia over 100 years ago, before the development of antibiotics and other modern medicine, Khan said.\u00a0 \u201cHistorical uses of radiotherapy for pneumonia led to a 90% response rate and prevented people from dying. If I am correct, we should see significant responses in Covid patients treated with low dose whole lung radiotherapy,\u201d Khan said. Investigators hope that those who receive the therapy will see improved pulmonary functioning with a decreased need for mechanical ventilation. What is radiation therapy? It refers to the use of high-energy beams to induce cell damage by destroying the genetic material that cells need to grow and divide. At high doses,\u00a0radiation\u00a0can cause severe tissue destruction and is used to shrink or destroy tumors as part of cancer treatment, according to Mayo Clinic. But at lower levels,\u00a0radiation\u00a0actually reduces inflammation by decreasing the production of certain chemicals called cytokines that are central to the inflammatory process, according to Khan.\u00a0 ##Health## Dr. Philip Breen, the father of\u00a0New York City emergency room doctor Lorna Breen\u00a0who died by suicide Sunday, said \"she put her life on the line to take care of other people.\" Dr. Lorna Breen had recovered from Covid-19 and continued to treat coronavirus patients. \u201cShe was a doctor, every bit of the word that a doctor should be,\u201d Breen said. \u201cShe put her life on the line to take care of other people.

Breen said his daughter contracted the virus and stayed home for just over a week, which in hindsight, he feels wasn\u2019t enough time.\u00a0 \u201cI think she felt an overwhelming sense of wanting to help her colleagues and her friends who were still fighting the good fight and so she strapped on her harness and took the bit in her mouth and she went back,\u201d Breen said.  During her final 12-hour shift, Breen said his daughter \"went down in the traces like a horse that had pulled too heavy a load and couldn\u2019t go a step further and just went down, and so she went down.\u201d Breen said his daughter was not struggling with any emotional difficulties or problems with stress prior to this. \u201cAs of Sunday, she took her own life because I think she was tired and she was the kind of person, as somebody has very aptly put it, she was like the fireman who runs into the burning building to save another life and doesn\u2019t regard anything about herself. So she has paid the price and she\u2019s been in the trenches,\u201d he said. He remembers his daughter as a salsa dancer, a nursing home volunteer, and a snowboarder.

What FEMA and HHS officials have said contradicts US President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence there is enough PPE and testing supplies available to states, chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said. \"During several recent briefings, officials from FEMA and HHS directly contradicted President Trump\u2019s claims,\u00a0admitting\u00a0that we do not have enough tests or protective equipment and that\u00a0critical\u00a0shortages are likely to continue,\" Maloney said. \n\"The President\u2019s\u00a0failed response to the coronavirus crisis has already caused untold suffering and chaos.\u00a0He needs to start being honest with the American people and come up with a nationwide plan to get the resources we need to prevent more Americans from dying.\" Read more about PPE shortages: ##Health## Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s campaign to distribute free, reusable cloth masks amid chronic shortages has been met with complaints that they are stained and dirty. The number of damaged masks intended for pregnant women in Japan had risen to 30,000 out of 500,000 by Tuesday, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. The masks are being dispatched in order of priority, with pregnant women at the top of the list, and are part of a wider plan to send two reusable cloth masks to roughly 50 million households in the country. Quality check underway: Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Japanese health minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters the safety of the masks would be checked.

Police officers used batons and fired shots in the air to disperse the crowd. A total of 30 people from Chand Pura village in Ambala district of Haryana state were arrested, said Abhishek Jorwal, superintendent of police in the district. \"Due to the coronavirus, the government has issued guidelines on disposing of bodies of patients who died in a hospital. The municipality designates where a body must be cremated,\"\u00a0Jorwal said. According to Jorwal, the villagers were unhappy that someone who was not from their village was being cremated on their grounds and might spread infection. \"We reassured them that all precautions were being taken but they picked up stones from the neighboring railway tracks and pelted them on the police. (The police) fired a few warning shots in the air and used minor lathi charge (beating with batons) to disperse the crowd so we could perform the last rites,\" Jorwal said. The postmortem report revealed that the woman did not have coronavirus.  Similar incident: Earlier this month, a mob threw stones at an ambulance carrying the body of a doctor who succumbed to the virus in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu state in southern India.\u00a0 Members of the ambulance crew and family and friends of the doctor were injured when they took the body to the burial ground, according to Dr. Rajan Sharma, president of the Indian Medical Association.

Many have continued to hammer phrases such as \"China flu\" or \"Wuhan virus,\" despite warnings that such terms could lead to increased hostility against Asians.  But for some, the Beijing model is not necessarily looking so bad. China, despite being where the virus first emerged, has coped with the ensuing pandemic far better than many other countries, even though those countries had a longer warning time and greater chance to prepare.\u00a0 The crisis has also highlighted the benefits of a strong government and centralized planning, while exposing the limitations of private industry to respond quickly, particularly in the\u00a0health care\u00a0sector. In the United States, which is often held up -- for better or worse -- as the example par excellence of a Western democracy, the alternative to the Chinese model appears to be somewhat chaotic.  Far from a strong government, Washington has found itself\u00a0fighting with state officials, facing\u00a0accusations of pilfering medical supplies\u00a0and growing calls for\u00a0greater state power. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has been accused of\u00a0spreading disinformation and\u00a0encouraging protests.

Three members of the McClean family contracted Covid-19 last month. Sydney McClean, the couple's daughter, was the only family member to never show any symptoms. The family found out their dog, Winston, tested positive for the virus too after they participated in a\u00a0Duke University study about Covid-19 aimed at trying to find potential treatments and vaccines. \"His (Winston's) amount of virus that we detected was very low, suggesting that he would not be a likely mechanism or vector of transmission of virus to either other animals or to, to humans in these households,\" said Chris Woods, the principal investigator of the study.
