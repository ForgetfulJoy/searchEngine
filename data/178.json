President Donald Trump said Sunday night that he was first briefed about coronavirus on January 23 and indicated the US intelligence agencies would be issuing a statement in the coming days. On January 23rd, I was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was of no real import. In other words it wasn\u2019t, \u2018Oh we gotta do something, we gotta do something.\u2019 It was a brief conversation and it was only on January 23rd,\" Trump said on Fox News. While Trump claims he was told that \"there could be a virus coming in,\" that January 23 briefing came three days after the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the United States. The President was also briefed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about the threat of the coronavirus during a January 18 phone call, according to multiple reports. Trump also said that at the time the US intelligence community was not \"competently run.\" \"And the intelligence agencies, which have now -- now, now -- because before they weren't, which are now very competently run with some great people ... the intelligence agencies will tell you that tomorrow,\" Trump said. CNN and other news outlets have reported that the President's daily intelligence briefing included information about the coronavirus outbreak in China and its potential to spread to the United States as early as January 3. It is not clear whether Trump -- who infrequently reads the President's Daily Brief compiled by intelligence officials -- read the information at the time or whether officials briefing the President in person raised the issue. A total of 373 employees and contract workers at Triumph Foods, a pork processing plant in Buchanan County, Missouri, have tested positive for coronavirus despite showing no related symptoms, according to a press release from the Department of Health and Senior Services. \u201cWe continue to work this weekend contacting these asymptomatic patients and have initiated the process of contact tracing with those determined to be close contacts of our positive cases,\u201d said Dr. Randall Williams, director of DHSS.\u00a0 The department encouraged anyone experiencing symptoms to reach out to their health care provider, the release said. The latest numbers come after the the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services announced Thursday more than 120 employees tested positive for Covid-19.  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told reporters Sunday that the state's Covid-19 cases were \"at the worst\" plateauing. He commended Kentucky residents for sticking to the state's guidelines.  \"You are saving thousands of lives,\" he said. \"I'm very proud to be your governor.\" Saying that he took yesterday off in order to recharge, Beshear gave both Saturday and Sunday numbers for cases and deaths. Saturday's report showed an additional 173 cases, with 5 deaths. Sunday's report showed 80 new cases and zero deaths, but Beshear himself cast doubt on those numbers, saying there had been a lull in testing.  \"This is why we average,\" he said. \"No day right now just has 80.\" He added that a report will come out tomorrow on cases in Green River State Prison.  \"We believe they are going to be tough numbers to see,\" he said. Beshear also responded to yesterday's protest over pandemic measures by calling it \"reckless.\"  \"All I asked that folks did if they disagree is to do it safely,\" he said. \"What I have heard is that speakers, and leaders, and even state representatives or state senators asked people to take off their masks, told people that social distancing is optional, and one even said they're not going to take the vaccine when it's created. That's just reckless.\" Beshear said more test kits will be arriving in the state in the coming week, and that over the course of the next few days he will be focusing on preparing businesses for phased reopenings. France will not impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers from the Schengen Area of the European Union and the UK, Elys\u00e9e Palace confirmed to CNN on Sunday. This is regardless of the nationality of those traveling to France. Sunday\u2019s statement appears to be a direct contradiction of Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran\u2019s statement a day earlier of a proposed measure to quarantine all people entering France from \u201cabroad, Corsica and other overseas territory.\u201d The French government will move to extend a state of emergency over coronavirus for around two months in a set of measures to be proposed to Parliament on Tuesday. The Schengen Area is a zone of 26 European countries that do not have internal borders and allow people to move between them freely, including countries such as Spain, France, Greece, Germany, Italy and Poland. Elys\u00e9e Palace would not comment on whether travellers from the US would be subject to quarantine measures if entering France. The President of Peru, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra,\u00a0approved a supreme decree\u00a0to\u00a0reactivate the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0economy amid the coronavirus pandemic,\u00a0according to a statement released by the\u00a0Office of the\u00a0Presidency Saturday.\u00a0  Speaking at the Council of Ministers, Vizcarra said\u00a0\u201cwe must\u00a0begin\u00a0economic\u00a0activities and seek balance to generate jobs,\u201d according to the statement,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vizcarra explained the decree\u00a0has been\u00a0analyzed\u00a0by health experts and\u00a0is\u00a0based on studies.\u00a0It\u00a0will\u00a0be carried out gradually and\u00a0has\u00a0four phases.\u00a0Each phase will last approximately one month\u00a0starting in\u00a0May\u00a0and ending in August.\u00a0\u00a0 The Peruvian president also announced\u00a0that\u00a0because of coronavirus concerns, he has signed\u00a0an early release pardon to\u00a0non-violent\u00a0prisoners\u00a0that are pregnant\u00a0and\u00a0mothers\u00a0who are in prison with their children.\u00a0\u00a0 The federal government will begin shipping \"tens of thousands\" of courses of remdesivir\u00a0early this week and will decide where the medicine goes, according to Daniel\u00a0O'Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, the maker of the investigational drug. In early results from a trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health,\u00a0remdesivir\u00a0was found to shorten the duration of illness in patients with severe Covid-19, but it had no statistically significant effect on whether patients died. We intend to get [remdesivir] to patients in the early part of this next week, beginning to work with the government, which will determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients are that need this medicine,\"\u00a0O'Day\u00a0said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" CNN has reached out to the US Department of Health and Human Services for comment on how the drug will be distributed. Brazil surpassed 100,000 cases of\u00a0Covid-19,\u00a0according to the latest figures released by the Health Ministry Sunday. The number of confirmed cases increased by 4,588 in a 24-hour period,\u00a0bringing\u00a0the total to 101,147.\u00a0 There are at least\u00a01,154,340\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and\u00a0at least\u00a067,447\u00a0people have died from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States. The totals include cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and US territories, as well as repatriated cases and those in the US military, veterans' hospitals and federal prisons.\u00a0 CNN has an interactive map tracking coronavirus cases across the country. Sunday marks the lowest recorded day for ventilator usage in Georgia since the pandemic began, according to a tweet from Governor Brian Kemp. Hospitals began submitting data on ventilator usage on April 8, the tweet said. Kemp also said that 964 ventilators were in use Sunday and that another 1,916 ventilators remain available. There are a total of 2,880 ventilators in the state, according to the\u00a0tweet. More than\u00a01 million\u00a0Florida workers have filed for unemployment benefits,\u00a0according to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) website.\u00a0\u00a0 The state has received 1,025,657 unique unemployment claims for the period between March 15 and May 2, the DEO site says.\u00a0\u00a0 Miami-Dade County leads the state with 66,842 unemployment claims filed.\u00a0The hospitality industry has been hit the hardest with 115,313 claimants in \"accommodation and food services\" filing for unemployment throughout the state,\u00a0the DEO website says. To date more than $700 million has been paid to claimants, about 60% of which was funded by\u00a0the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program. The state of Illinois has reached an agreement with a handful of banks that will allow residents without bank accounts to cash their stimulus checks free of charge, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a Sunday news conference. One in five Illinois households are either underbanked or unbanked, Pritzker said. The partnered institutions include Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Fifth Third and First Midwest Bank, Pritzker said. Other banks are welcome to join the agreement, Pritzker said.\u00a0 Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington has announced that American Airlines will only use the center concourse at the airport, or gates 23-34, beginning Monday. As result, due to reduced activity, the airport will temporarily suspend flight operations from Terminal C, Gates 35-45. This closure will include gate 35X, American\u2019s commuter gate that required passengers to be bused to and from their planes. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer is calling for the federal government to stop predatory lenders from preying on people who are in desperate need of emergency funds as the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause economic hardship for millions of Americans, in a press release issued Sunday. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis is creating a desperate situation for countless Americans and New Yorkers, but it is also creating nefarious opportunity for greedy loan sharks who smell proverbial blood in the consumer waters,\u201d\u00a0Schumer said.  He said that \"loan sharks\" will stop at nothing to drown everyday consumers and small businesses \u201cin a cascade of debt that could far outlast the coronavirus itself.\" \u201cInterest rate loans that can hover around 800% aren\u2019t just eye-popping \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re downright shameful,\u201d the release said.\u00a0 Schumer wants the nation\u2019s federal regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to act and stop rolling back regulations that enable predatory lenders to prey on people. There were 19,417 new coronavirus tests conducted in Illinois within 24 hours, which is the highest number ever performed in a single day, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a Sunday afternoon news conference. Pritzker said that 2,994 new coronavirus cases were reported Sunday for a total of 61,499. An additional 63 deaths were reported for a total of 2,618 coronavirus deaths, Pritzker added. Scams on the rise: Officials in Illinois have heard of several coronavirus-related scams including door to door sales of testing kits and fake products to treat the virus, Pritzker said. There have been instances of people soliciting donations for fake charities and fraudulent efforts to obtain stimulus checks, according to Pritzker. The state Attorney General will use the power of his office to hold people accountable for their actions during the coronavirus pandemic including attempts to scam people, Pritzker added. Most ninth-grade girls worry about schoolwork, friends and crushes. Lately, however, Valerie Xu has focused on face masks. The 15-year-old from Addison, Texas, says she wanted to do something about the lack of protective gear for medical workers during the coronavirus pandemic. She also wanted to combat stories stigmatizing Asian Americans during the outbreak. Armed with resourcefulness and a teenager's urge to fit in, Xu raised donations and delivered 10,000 protective masks to a Dallas medical center. Some background: The donation drive started with a conversation Xu had with a family friend, a Florida emergency room doctor who was forced to wear the same protective mask for several days. \"This really amazed me in America,\" Xu told CNN. \"We're supposed to be considered the richest country in the world, yet doctors and nurses fighting on the front line cannot get proper protection.\" Since Xu wanted to make a local impact, she launched a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0to purchase masks for the UT Southwestern Medical Center, the largest facility near her home. So far, it has raised more than $3,800. Xu researched vendors in China and picked two suppliers, donating $1,200 of her own money to the cause. She said her campaign so far has collected a total of 11,200 masks \u2013\u2013 10,000 surgical and 1,200 FFP2 masks, which are equivalent to N95 masks in the US. Read more about Xu's impact. Some businesses will start to reopen in Spain on Monday as the country starts \"Phase Zero\" of loosening coronavirus restrictions. Following eight weeks of strict confinement since a country-wide state of emergency was declared on March 14, the process of transition in Spain will be gradual.\u00a0 The four phases will be determined by a \u201cseries of indicators, such as the strategic capacities available in the healthcare system,\" officials say. Some of these indicators include being able to test and identify sources of contagion and the ability to isolate and control those sources. Some other context: Spain's Ministry of Health said another key to reopening the economy is the availability of hospital beds.  For every 10,000 residents, hospitals have to be able to add between 1.5 to 2 intensive care unit beds, and between 37 to 40 beds for severely ill patients, as outlined by the Ministry. Across Spain, masks will be mandatory on public transport\u00a0as of Monday. Here are some of the reopening guidelines for businesses:  Hotel and restaurant terraces will be able to\u00a0operate at\u00a050% of capacity, but will have to clean and disinfect tables, chairs, and other surfaces, between clients.\nSmall retail and commercial businesses will be open to the public at 30% capacity, and will offer priority service to people over 65. \nClothing stores will be required to disinfect fitting areas, and \u201chygiene any garment before other clients have access to it.\"\nBusinesses are responsible for providing personal protective equipment to their employees. Asset management company\u00a0and hotel group Ashford Inc. announced on Saturday that it will return all funds provided by the Small Business Administration\u00a0due to the agency's recently changed rules, according to a press release.\u00a0 Calling the federal guidance \u201cinconsistent,\u201d\u00a0the company defended itself and said that Congress designed the Paycheck Protection Program to allow companies that own multiple hotel properties to obtain separate loans for each property.\u00a0 Ashford said that they could not have known that appropriations would be insufficient to cover other businesses.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAshford management had no intention of crowding out any business from gaining equal access to the PPP funds,\u201d the company said. Asset management company\u00a0Ashford\u00a0(AHT)\u00a0and its related luxury hotel REITs\u00a0received more than 56 loans\u00a0totaling nearly $59 million,\u00a0SEC\u00a0filings\u00a0show.  The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0and the\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0first reported the news on Ashford. Connecticut closed 11 state parks Saturday as limits were reached for proper social distancing, according to the state's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). Sleeping Giant and Southford Falls state parks, both near New Haven, were among those closed early. All these parks were reopened Sunday morning. \"There\u2019s plenty of room for everybody, we just encourage people to spread out as best they can,\" said DEEP spokesperson Will Healey. \"We encourage people to peruse our entire list of state parks.\" DEEP has only closed two state parks indefinitely, both because geographic features made it difficult to maintain a safe distance. If the crowds at parks continue, there may be indefinite closures, Healey said. \"That\u2019s an option that\u2019s on the table,\" Healey said. \"We want to keep them open during this public health crisis, but we want to do it as safe as possible.\" \u00a0 Afghanistan released 98 Taliban prisoners from Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul on Saturday evening as part of the government\u2019s efforts to contain coronavirus, according to a statement from the National Directorate of Security.  The release is in line with a decree Afghan President Ashraf Ghani signed on\u00a0March 11 to release Taliban prisoners as the peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban began. The prisoners were released based on their health conditions, age and length of remaining sentence. So far, 650 Taliban prisoners have been released since March 10, and the government will release 850 more, the statement added. \u201cThe government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan remains open continuing joint technical work with the Taliban in order to advance the peace process,\u201d the statement read. Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines, said the risk of catching coronavirus from an airplane is not \u201cany greater than the risk anywhere else.\u201d  In an interview on CBS, Kelly emphasized the safety precautions they have put in place, and said that they are \u201cdoing everything possible to encourage people to come back and fly.\u201d Southwest Airlines is one of the major US airlines that has announced it will require all passengers to wear masks, starting on May 11. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an FAQ on traveling: \u201cBecause of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily. Although the risk of infection on an airplane is low, try to avoid contact with sick passengers, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\u201d Some business context: Kelly said that Southwest Airlines has applied for another government loan, but that he did not know if they would take it. Although the number of flights has drastically reduced due to the coronavirus, Kelly believes that \u201cwe have seen the bottom here\u201d and noted that\u00a0\u201ceach week after the first week of April has gotten successfully better.\u201d  Kelly is \u201canxious to see how the travel demand develops in the summer.\" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan discussed protesters in his state that are opposed to the coronavirus restrictions currently in place. \"I think everybody has a right to protest and express their feelings. ... Sadly, we had far more people die yesterday in Maryland than we had protesters,\" Hogan told CNN. Protests around the US: Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina and Utah have all seen protests over the past month as people grow more concerned about the economic fallout of the pandemic. On Friday, more than 500 people gathered at the California Capitol in Sacramento to protest Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order. As a result, police arrested 32 people for failing to comply with the lawful orders to disperse,\u00a0along with health and safety violations, a news release said. Watch the interview: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a new regional partnership with seven northeast states to form a purchasing consortium to obtain medical equipment and supplies.\u00a0\u00a0 The consortium will purchase $5 billion of equipment and supplies that will include personal protective equipment, tests and ventilators, Cuomo said. This new partnership will make the states more competitive in the international marketplace, save taxpayer money and help the region acquire medical equipment, Cuomo added. The governor added that the consortium will coordinate with the federal government. The seven states in the consortium are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that \"we're not out of the woods\" when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic in New York. \"My gut says the weather is\u00a0going to warm, people are bored, people want this over.\u00a0They see the numbers going down.\u00a0They can take false comfort,\" Cuomo said at his daily coronavirus news briefing. \"We never said it was over.\u00a0We said the numbers are going\u00a0down,\" he added. \"Roughly a thousand new people a day walk into the hospitals.\" Cuomo said the reason numbers in the state are generally trending down is because New Yorkers followed social distancing and other measures. \"You go back to the old behavior and that number goes right back up,\" Cuomo said. The sight of New Yorkers refusing to wear masks despite the coronavirus pandemic infecting hundreds daily is \"disrespectful,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. \"We almost overwhelmed the whole\u00a0health care system.\u00a0So cautious moving forward and,\u00a0look, how people cannot wear\u00a0masks, that, to me, is even\u00a0disrespectful.\u00a0It's disrespectful.\u00a0It's disrespectful to the\u00a0nurses, the doctors, the people\u00a0who have been front line\u00a0workers, the transit workers.\u00a0You wear the mask not for\u00a0yourself.\u00a0You wear the mask for me. It's a sign of respect to other\u00a0people.\u00a0You make me sick.\u00a0That's disrespectful,\" Cuomo said during a news conference attended by other state leaders around the northeast. Some context: Cuomo also announced that 280 people in New York state have died over the past day from coronavirus. Ahead of businesses reopening on Puerto Rico, crowded lines have been seen outside a grocery store which violate the social distancing order on the island, government officials say. Photos of packed lines outside a grocery store in Puerto Rico were posted by Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced and the island's department of health Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0 \"If businesses do not help with implementing the order, they cannot request to reopen. It is a serious matter, the economy cannot prevail over an aspiration of a healthy and living people,\" Vazquez said in a tweet Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0 Some context: Puerto Rico businesses have been closed since March 16, excluding\u00a0grocery stores, banks, and pharmacies.  Now, some small businesses, including accounting and real estate offices,\u00a0will be allowed to open on Monday as long as they adhere to social distancing guidelines and provide protective equipment to employees, Vaquez said on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0 Puerto Rico's Department of Health also voiced concern over the crowded lines in a tweet: \"Our efforts have been to safeguard the health of all Puerto Ricans. If businesses and citizens do not cooperate, and promote violation of the Executive Order, we will have to close again. Distance measurements are mandatory!\"\u00a0 Read the tweet: \u00a0 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will now require all hospitals to build a 90-day supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus hospitalizations. \"We're going to put in a state\u00a0requirement now that every\u00a0hospital has to have a 90-day\u00a0supply stockpiled.\u00a0Their own stockpile of all the\u00a0PPE equipment they could need\u00a0for a 90-day supply at the rate\u00a0of usage we saw with this Covid\u00a0virus,\" Cuomo said at a news briefing on Sunday. Cuomo said New York, and the rest of the country, needs to \"institutionalize\u00a0these lessons\" that were learned during the outbreak. \"We can't go through this\u00a0day-to-day moving masks across\u00a0the state.\u00a0This mad scramble we're in and\u00a0still are in in many ways.\u00a0As a nation, we can't go through\u00a0it again,\" he said. Cuomo said it is important to prepare for another surge of infections. \"People talk about this like it's\u00a0going to come and go and so once\u00a0in a lifetime.\u00a0I don't know it's once in a\u00a0lifetime,\" he said. \"If you look back as far back as 1918 when they had the flu pandemic people talk about, it took 10 months. It came in three different waves, and the second wave was worse than the first wave,\" Cuomo added. \"So let's be prepared and intelligent.\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced that 280 people in New York have died over the past day from coronavirus. \"The number that is the most\u00a0important number that we look\u00a0at, which is still tremendously\u00a0distressing is the number of\u00a0deaths: 280.\u00a0You can see the number hasn't\u00a0moved dramatically in a relatively long period of time.\u00a0The overall direction is good\u00a0even though it's very painful.\u00a0I think it's important we take a\u00a0moment and learn the lessons of\u00a0what we've been going through,\" Cuomo said at a news conference Sunday. The number of Covid-19\u00a0deaths in the state totaled 299 on May 1, Cuomo said Saturday. Cuomo added today that the number of intubations is\u00a0down as is the number of hospitalizations. The United Kingdom has seen a decrease in number of coronavirus-related deaths in the past 24 hours. There have been a total of 28,446 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, Michael Gove, one of the senior Cabinet ministers leading the response to the pandemic, said during a daily government press briefing.\u00a0 \u201cBefore we can ease existing restrictions we must ensure the government\u2019s five tests are met,\"  Gove said.\u00a0 The tests require the number of cases to continue falling, death rates to be in decline, that the national health service has all of the equipment and support it needs and that measures are in place to stop a second peak overwhelming the National Health Service. The country is now \u201cpast the peak\u201d of deaths, but a decline \u201cmust be sustained,\" professor Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, added. There are at least\u00a01,134,058\u00a0cases of coronavirus in the US and roughly 66,430 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. As states begin to include \u201cprobable deaths\u201d in their counts, so will the university. In the upcoming days, these changes may show as surges of deaths in the United States.\u00a0 The totals includes cases from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other US territories, as well as repatriated cases and those in the US military, veterans hospitals and federal prisons.\u00a0 The number of people admitted into hospitals for Covid-19 as of yesterday was 113, which is up slightly from the 92 admitted April 30, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. People that are currently in intensive care units across the city is 645; that number is down from the 677 reported on April 30, de Blasio said. About 20% of the people tested for Covid-19 across the city tested positive. That number is down from 21% reported April 30. White House trade adviser\u00a0Peter Navarro told CNN that the administration thinks it moved as quickly as other countries in addressing the coronavirus pandemic.  President Trump \u201cmoves stuff in Trump time. We are moving mountains in this crisis,\" Navarro said. On the issue of testing, Navarro emphasized \u201cwe\u2019re doing what we need to do as fast as we can do it,\u201d and said he sees a \u201cbright future ahead.\u201d  On the economy: Navarro said that when he visited the General Motors plant with Vice President Mike Pence in Kokomo, Indiana, he \u201csaw the future.\" He said the President will\u00a0\u201chave a\u00a0pathway to rebuilding this\u00a0economy, which now has\u00a0manufactured unemployment, but\u00a0which will have a manufacturing\u00a0renaissance.\u201d New York City will produce its own Covid-19 test kits, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today. The city will be working with Print Parks, a local partner, that will help create swabs for the testing kits, the mayor said. The city is on track to produce 50,000 3D-printed swabs per week, with an initial 30,000 expected by the end of this week, de Blasio said. The testing kits are broken down into three parts, swabs, transport medium and screw tube tops, the mayor said. Viral Transport Medium (VTM) will get the tests to hospitals as soon as possible, he said. \u00a0##Health## Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he is concerned about reopening the economy and relaxing social distancing measures, saying it is still very early in the outbreak. Massachusetts\u00a0is \u201cbetween the first and the fifth\u201d inning\u00a0in its fight against coronavirus, and that\u00a0\u201cwe\u2019re still very much in the beginning days of coronavirus,\" Walsh said. \u201cI think we're between the first and the fifth. I think that these numbers, we see, they are going up. We are watching our hospitalization. Our hospitals are doing a very good job of managing,\u201d Walsh told CNN Sunday morning. Walsh criticized the Trump administration\u2019s response to the outbreak, saying \u201cthe mixed messaging is confusing.\u201d  He responded to pictures of crowds on the national mall in Washington, DC, and New York's Central Park, saying,\u00a0\u201cwhether it's Central Park or the Mall is the wrong message. We're still very much in the beginning days of coronavirus.\u201d Walsh said cities across the US still need mass testing and personal protective equipment for frontline workers. \"As we move down the road here, if there's a second surge, all of the equipment that they have now, they'll need more stuff. I think that's what the federal government should be focused on,\u201d Walsh said. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said on Fox this morning that having a coronavirus vaccine by January is possible \u201con paper\u201d but will require the proper execution. Birx was asked whether it was realistic to have a vaccine by the start of next year, given other estimates that it will take at least 12 to 18 months to develop. \u201cThe way that it\u2019s possible is if you bring forward five or six different classes of candidates, which the Operation Warp Speed has done,\u201d Birx said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s not relying on a single vaccine platform. It\u2019s relying on several different candidates that are made differently and act differently.\u201d The vaccine would also require speeding up clinical trials, she said.  \u201cAnd so, on paper it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s whether we can execute and execute around the globe, because you also, for phase three, have to have active viral transmission in a community in order to study its efficacy,\" Birx said. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that the goal is to make 100 million doses of a vaccine available by November, 200 million doses by December and 300 million doses by January, according to a senior administration official. On remdesivir: Birx described the investigational drug remdesivir as a \u201cfirst step forward.\" In early results from a trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the drug was found to shorten the duration of illness in severely affected patients, but it had no statistically significant effect on mortality. Birx said we\u2019ve only seen \u201chalf the data,\u201d but she said an independent monitoring board thought the improvement was significant enough to start giving remdesivir to patients who were previously receiving a placebo. \u201cSo it\u2019s a first step forward. In parallel, we have a whole series of therapeutics including plasma, and also monoclonal antibodies being worked through,\u201d she said, referring to lab-made antibodies targeting the virus.\u00a0 Larry Kudlow, the head of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told CNN there may be a need for additional stimulus aid because of Covid-19 but said there was a \u201cpause\u201d right now before money is sought. Kudlow said the government still needs to execute the last package and \u201csee what the results are.\u201d The President was \u201cvery keen\u201d on a payroll tax holiday for workers and would like to see tax deductions for businesses/entertainment, as well as a shield on liabilities, Kudlow said. Democrats have opposed such a payroll holiday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said that the protests last week in the Michigan state legislature were \u201cdevastatingly worrisome to me, personally.\u201d  In an interview on Fox today, Birx expressed her concern about protestors exposing elderly family members to the virus because if there was an \u201cunfortunate outcome,\u201d those people would feel guilty. Birx called on Americans to \u201cprotect each other, at the same time we are voicing our discontent.\u201d About the protests: Protesters crammed inside the capitol building where the lawmakers were meeting on Friday, demanding an end to the state's state of emergency. About 400 to 700 people stood on the Capitol grounds, according to Michigan State Police. The state of emergency was set to expire on Thursday. On Friday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed executive orders that terminated the old state of emergency and put in place a new one through May 28.  Last week, Whitmer had extended the separate stay-at-home order through May 15. White House chief economic adviser\u00a0Larry Kudlow defended his initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying \"my\u00a0quote then was based on the\u00a0actual facts which at the time.\" Kudlow said on February 25, \"we have contained this. I won't say airtight, but pretty close to airtight. We've done a good job in the United States.\" At that time, the US had 53 confirmed cases, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was warning there would be \"community spread in the country.\" \"My quote was, at that time, there\u00a0were very few cases.\u00a0Then, as the virus spread\u00a0exponentially in ways that\u00a0virtually no one could have\u00a0predicted, of course we changed\u00a0our mind,\" Kudlow told CNN Sunday morning. \"There was hardly any cases,\" he added. Kudlow said the administration was dealing with the information they had at the time. \"When the information changes,\u00a0you change.\u00a0We changed our strategy.\u00a0So did everybody else around the\u00a0world change their strategy,\" he said. Watch: Spain reported 164 deaths from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, the lowest number in six weeks, according to new figures released by the country\u2019s Ministry of Health on Sunday. \u201cAs sad as it is to speak about the deaths, the increase of 0.7 percent from the previous day is a good number\u201d said\u00a0Fernando Sim\u00f3n, Spain\u2019s director for health emergencies, comparing the number to coronavirus fatality figures in recent weeks.\u00a0 The total number of deaths\u00a0since the start of the pandemic\u00a0in the country stands at 25,264. Speaking at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus technical briefing, Sim\u00f3n noted a \u201cclear decrease of numbers\u201d of new hospital and intensive care unit admissions, as well as a 0.39% rise in new infections since Saturday, which are about half of the numbers of those who have recovered in the same period.\u00a0\u00a0 Sim\u00f3n cautioned that Sunday\u2019s markedly improved numbers could be influenced by\u00a0the\u00a0delayed\u00a0long weekend holiday reporting from Spain\u2019s 17 regions.\u00a0 More data: A total of 42,111 health workers have been infected by coronavirus to date, Spain\u2019s health ministry Sunday reported, representing nearly one fifth of all cases at 19%.\u00a0 As Spain gradually begins its de-escalation from strict confinement-in-place orders in place since March 15, four islands in the Canaries and the Balearics will be the first to transition to so-called \"Phase One\" on Monday. During this time, a further opening\u00a0up of small businesses\u00a0and further lifting of restrictions on movements is expected because the\u00a0islands\u00a0\u201chave not had any new cases in many days, and very few, or no new infections.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said his main priority is to keep people safe as some lockdown measures in Texas began to ease on Friday. \u201cWhat I have to do is do my job as the mayor of Dallas, which is to keep our people safe,\" Johnson told CNN. People in Dallas are \u201cputting their toe back in\" and  \"aren't pouring back into these restaurants and into movie theaters\u00a0and malls and things because they don't feel like it's safe to do so,\" Johnson said. The mayor also expressed skepticism about the prospects of a speedy return to the \u201cnormal\u201d of three months ago, as President Trump has suggested would be possible. Johnson called that prospect \"unrealistic.\" \u201cIt's impossible to say what we think is going to happen in the next few months. But I think this,\u00a0I think it's unrealistic to believe that we're going to be able to be shoulder to shoulder here anymore soon,\" Johnson said. \"As much as we want to control things, to try to pick a date on the calendar and say we will be opened by this date and we will be shoulder to shoulder at baseball games by this date, it doesn't work that way,\" he added. Despite meat processing plants across the US shutting down due to coronavirus concerns, for now, you can still find plenty of meat in the grocery stores. One thing you can't find on the shelves is flour. Stores are cleaned out and it's not currently available on most websites. But why is that? Carey Underwood, who is director of mission-driven partnerships and programs at King Arthur Flour, said it's because people have been baking a lot. \"People who were baking monthly are now baking weekly, and people who were baking weekly are baking daily,\" she said. \"We expect this increase in baking to continue for the foreseeable future as trends show more in-home eating compared to dining out and people choosing to bake the food staples they cannot find in their grocery stores.\" Underwood said the shortage in grocery stores is because of the spike in demand for flour, not because there is a shortage of wheat. \"The demand for all signature flours, but especially all-purpose and bread flours, is simply unprecedented and is outpacing the inventory in our warehouses,\" she said. Underwood added: \"The wheat is available, but it must be milled, bagged, and transported to warehouses. These steps simply take time and the flour is selling out again as quickly as it reaches shelves.\" Read more. ##Daily Life## The Trump administration announced Sunday that at least 2.2 million loans, worth about $175 billion, have been paid out in the second round of federal emergency relief aid for small businesses. The second relief package was signed into law by Trump on April 24 and included an additional $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The second round of PPP was distributed starting on April 27. In a joint statement Sunday morning, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Small Business Administration Administrator Jovita Carranza said the average size of a loan made under the second round of the program was $79,000.  During the first round, there was criticism over how some large corporations and other entities like private schools had applied for, and were given, loans. \u201cThe Paycheck Protection Program is providing critical support to millions of small businesses and tens of millions of hardworking Americans,\u201d Mnuchin and Carranza said in the statement adding the average loan size indicated \u201c\u2026the program is broadly based and assisting the smallest of small businesses.\u201d The administration said since the launch of the PPP, about 3.8 million loans, totaling more than $500 billion, have been made. Bangladesh reported 665 new coronavirus cases on Sunday -- the largest single-day increase since the outbreak was first reported in the country on March 8, the country's state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) said.\u00a0 The densely populated South Asian nation has so far reported 9,455 cases and 177 deaths, the BSS reported, citing a senior health department official. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday held a video conference call with officials from 56 districts across the country on the coronavirus situation, according to the BSS.\u00a0 During the call, the prime minister announced several stimulus packages and steps to combat the fallout from the pandemic, in addition to directing the officials to take steps to contain the virus in their areas. ##Health## The novel coronavirus has infected more than\u00a03.4 million people\u00a0and killed at least 244,000 worldwide. If you're just joining us now, here are the latest developments on the pandemic. Parks and protests in US: The pandemic\u00a0drove people across the US outside for recreation\u00a0and\u00a0protest. While thousands rallied in California, residents of New York City and Washington DC enjoyed warmer weather Saturday while observing social distancing. States including Pennsylvania and New Jersey were able to visit some state parks, forest facilities and golf courses for the first time this spring.\nRussia cases spike: Russia reported 10,633 new coronavirus cases in another record single-day increase Sunday, bringing the total to 134,687 cases and 1,280 deaths.\u00a0Russia has seen four days of record increases after a week of steady growth. Moscow, the country\u2019s worst-hit city, accounts for more than half the cases.\nUK launches app: A contact-tracing app will be released this week in the UK as the country's transport minister suggested people would be encouraged to walk or ride to work when restrictions ease. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said doctors had plans in case things went \"badly wrong\" when he was in hospital with the coronavirus.\nLeaders pledge funds: The leaders of France, Norway, Italy and Germany have pledged to raise an initial $8 billion on Monday in an \u201cinternational alliance\u201d to find a vaccine and treatments for the coronavirus.\u00a0They said more funding would be required to achieve their aim of developing and delivering medicines worldwide.\nChina's busy holiday weekend:\u00a0Mainland China reported no new deaths for the fifth day in a row Saturday, as people flocked to attractions around the country for the Labour Day weekend. Meanwhile, Harbin City, on the Russia-China border, closed all dine-in restaurants until further notice, according to state-run CCTV. \nFrance's deaths decline:\u00a0The daily number of deaths from coronavirus in France continues to decline. At least 24,760 people have died from coronavirus, an increase of 166 since Friday, the Health Ministry announced Saturday. The French government will extend its state of emergency for another two months.\nThailand lifts alcohol ban:\u00a0Thailand began to ease some of its month-long restrictions today, as Covid-19 cases continue to fall. Businesses such as markets and hairdressers can reopen, train and bus stations can also reopen and bars can sell alcoholic drinks, but people must consume them at home.\u00a0\nPhilippines suspends air travel:\u00a0All passenger and commercial flights to and from the country were suspended today to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Philippines has confirmed 8,928 coronavirus cases and 604 deaths. ##Daily Life## ##Travel## ##Health## ##Business## Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by attacks on press freedoms and journalists around the world amid the pandemic. We've seen this pattern before: A crisis engulfs a nation, and its government moves to curtail, manipulate or shut down news coverage. But that doesn't mean that we should pay less attention to it now. In fact, we should be especially vigilant.\u00a0 Iran has imposed sweeping restrictions on coverage of the pandemic, including a\u00a0ban on printing newspapers. Journalists have been arrested for their reporting, including one who\u00a0criticized the government's failure\u00a0to prepare and another who\u00a0alleged that a local official had tested positive\u00a0for Covid-19. In Hungary, a new law giving the prime minister wide-ranging emergency powers includes a provision prohibiting publication of \"false information\" on the pandemic, with violators facing up to five years in prison. The law has generated uncertainty over whether journalists could be prosecuted for reporting true information. China's government maintains that controlling information is necessary to combat the virus. Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who traveled in January to Wuhan and posted videos on YouTube reporting that hospitals were overwhelmed,\u00a0has not been heard from\u00a0since February 6.  This \"Covid-19 crackdown\" \u2014 as Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,\u00a0has called it\u00a0\u2014 is unfolding as we mark\u00a0World Press Freedom Day\u00a0on May 3, in a reminder to defend the press from attacks on its independence, and remember those who have lost their lives while keeping us informed.

But\u00a0White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett\u00a0freely admits he can't map the path out.\u00a0 A lot of it depends on things I have no expertise in,\" Hassett, previously a CNN contributor, said in an interview this past week with Poppy Harlow.\u00a0 That's the surreal reality facing\u00a0President Donald Trump's\u00a0economic team as growth turns into contraction and\u00a030 million Americans have lost their jobs. It is a Great Depression-level economic crisis that has everything to do with public health -- but, unlike the 2008 financial collapse, very little to do with anything wrong in the underlying economy.\u00a0 As a result, the tools economists typically use for adjusting supply and demand -- targeted spending, tax cuts, changes to trade and regulatory policy -- hold little power. The restoration of American prosperity lies more in the hands of the public health officials, epidemiologists and scientists\u00a0racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine.\u00a0 \"The No. 1 rule of virus economics is, go stop the virus if you want to fix the economy,\" says Austan Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama. He suggested that White House economists pore over state-by-state data to identify the best ways to halt epidemic spread. Success would preserve the possibility of the rapid \"V-shaped\" recovery that the Trump administration has embraced as its objective.

Each day, members of the team receive the list of victims' birthdays from museum employees. They then place a single white rose on top of each victim's name on the memorial outside the building.\u00a0 It's a way of saying, we're not going to stop doing what we do, we just have to do it a slightly different way,\" Alice Greenwald, president and CEO of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, told CNN.\u00a0 FloraTech, which donates the flowers, has continued to order them from the Netherlands for this specific purpose, even though the store is closed.

But after just nine days, the coronavirus forced schools to close, leaving him without the classroom access he needs to complete the last requirement for his teaching license. \"It's very, very stressful,\" he said. \"It's something I think about every day, because I've worked hard to get to the point where I'm at now. I was very excited for this year, excited to get started with my career in education.\"\u00a0 Across the US, aspiring educators have had to adjust their plans after\u00a043 states and the District of Columbia closed schools through the end of the year\u00a0to slow the spread of Covid-19. They should be in the classroom, working with students and gaining hands-on experience.\u00a0 Instead, they're navigating new rules as states try to provide alternate routes for certification. And they've had to adapt,\u00a0like their mentors, to teaching online\u00a0and redefining what their student-teaching experiences look like. It's raised questions about whether they'll be ready when they have classes of their own.

At a briefing, Chung said that from Wednesday closed facilities will reopen gradually and events and gatherings will be allowed as long as they abide by disinfection guidelines. Local governments can however adjust their administrative orders according to local circumstances, Chung said. Chung suggested that the country\u2019s health authorities review lowering the current highest alert level but urged the nation to maintain some social distancing measures in everyday life. The numbers: South Korea reported 13 new virus cases on Sunday, bringing the nation's total infection cases to 10,793, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  ##Daily Life## The UK\u2019s coronavirus contact-tracing app -- which will alert users if they have been near someone infected with the virus -- will start being used in a limited way this week, said the country\u2019s Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. \u201cThat system\u2019s going into testing this week on the Isle of Wight. And then later in the month that app will be rolled out and deployed\u00a0-- assuming the tests are successful of course -- to the population at large,\u201d he told Sky News. \"And the idea is that we will encourage as many people as possible to take this up as possible. \"We need for this to work \u2013 50, 60% of people to be using this app.\u201d He said it would be the \"best possible way\" for people to help the UK's National Health Service (NHS), adding that the data will be confidential. Other countries have already launched smartphone apps to help track the spread of the virus in the community. Shapps also indicated there\u2019ll be a push to get more people walking or riding to work when coronavirus restrictions start to ease so that public transport is not overcrowded. \u201c[There is] a very popular scheme where you can buy a bike through your employer \u2013 effectively before tax \u2013 and pay it back,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen hundreds of percent increase [in interest] in that scheme.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to be saying more about that shortly because 'active transport\u2019 \u2013 keeping people off the public transport and getting there off their own steam \u2013 that can be a very important part of the recovery.\u201d The UK has now recorded 183,500 cases and 28,205 deaths from the coronavirus, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.  ##Daily Life## Russia reported 10,633 new cases of the coronavirus in another record single-day increase Sunday, bringing the total number to 134,687. Around 50% of the cases were asymptomatic, the country\u2019s coronavirus response headquarters said in a statement, adding that a total of 1,280 deaths had now been recorded. Russia has seen four consecutive days of record single-day increases after a week of relatively steady growth, when it added five to six thousand cases per day. Moscow, the country\u2019s worst-hit city, accounts for more than a half of total cases. In March, Vladimir Putin radiated confidence about his government's response\u00a0to a growing global crisis, reassuring his citizens that the situation was \"under control\" thanks to early intervention measures. The Russian President then played the role of international rescuer,\u00a0dispatching a planeload of medical supplies to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. But by April 13, the mood had changed. \"We have a lot of problems,\" Putin said in a video conference. \"There is nothing to boast about, and we must not let our guard down, because in general, as you and your specialists say, we have not passed the peak of the epidemic yet.\" ##Health## A video posted Saturday by the George W.

Most of the cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Ten are Singaporeans or permanent residents, the ministry said.  In recent weeks, the Asian city-state has had a spike in coronavirus infections, with thousands of new cases linked to clusters in foreign worker dormitories. To control the spread, the government has attempted to isolate the dormitories, test workers and move symptomatic patients into quarantine facilities. But those measures have left hundreds of thousands of workers trapped in their dormitories, living cheek by jowl in cramped conditions that make social distancing near impossible. Singapore has announced plans to ease restrictions over the coming weeks, with business to resume more fully from June 1.

Earlier, Johnson and his fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds revealed they had named their newborn son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. The names are a tribute to their grandfathers and two doctors who treated the prime minister in hospital. Wilfred was the name of Boris Johnson\u2019s grandfather and Lawrie was the name of Symonds\u2019s grandfather. The doctors who treated Johnson were\u00a0both named Nicholas.\u00a0 The baby was born Wednesday, just weeks after the Prime Minister was discharged from hospital. ##Health## The Dalai Lama has called for a \u201ccoordinated, global response\u201d to fight the coronavirus pandemic. \"In this time of serious crisis, we face threats to our health and sadness for the family and friends we have lost.

They were found in the machine when the truck carrying the cement mixer was pulled over by police in the state of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday.  \u201cThe laborers were found in the vent where the cement is mixed for construction purposes when a cement mixing truck was stopped for checking in central India\u2019s Indore town by the police,\" Umakant Choudhary, a senior police official in Indore said.  The workers were traveling from Mumbai, in western India, to their homes in the northern  state of Uttar Pradesh, said Choudhary -- a distance of more than 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles).

While many people hunker down at home, reloading the internet sites of grocery stores to secure a home delivery slot or dreading the socially distanced, masked visit to a supermarket, it's easy to lose sight of the supply chain and where that food is coming from. As Covid-19 cases surpass 170,000 in the United Kingdom, British farmers are facing spring cut off from the Eastern European migrant workers that make the harvest possible. But with thousands of Brits laid off or furloughed, the UK government now says its official policy is to try to get locals onto the fields. Sally Penfold, 45, was until recently a waitress at a restaurant in Hastings. After the UK government lockdown took effect, she lost her job. Penfold is one of several people seeking work at a family-owned farm in Kent, southeast England. \"I was fed up with being indoors, not earning any money,\" said Sally Penfold, 45. \"I just wanted to get out there and do some kind of work.

In an appeal this week, Tokyo's\u00a0Sumida Aquarium\u00a0asked for volunteers to FaceTime its 300 spotted garden eels, which have had limited interactions with humans since the aquarium was forced to close in March. \"As the (aquarium) has been closed for a long time, the animals aren't seeing any other people other than the staff ... they're beginning to forget about humans,\" the aquarium said in a\u00a0statement.\n\"The garden eels in particular have started to burrow themselves into the sand and hide even when aquarium (staff) pass by their tank,\" they added. This, the aquarium says, is a problem -- the eels' newfound shyness means staff are unable to check up on the fish and make sure they are healthy. ##Travel## ##Daily Life## The novel coronavirus has infected more than 3.4 million people worldwide and killed at least 243,000, according to data from\u00a0Johns Hopkins University.

However, restrictions have eased in some low-risk areas that haven't had new cases in three weeks. China: Mainland China was the first country in the world to go under lockdown. Now, with its daily cases in the low single digits, some cities are easing their restrictions and tourist favorites like Beijing's Forbidden City are reopening. However, some limitations remain, such as daily visitor caps and health checks. More than 1 million people flocked to Shanghai's attractions over the Labor Day weekend.  Singapore: The city-state plans to ease restrictions over the coming weeks, with business to resume more fully from June 1. Employers and companies will be under strict requirements to reduce the risk of infection. Some residents will be allowed to exercise in public areas from May 5 and from May 12 select services will be allowed to resume, including food manufacturing, food delivery and takeaway, laundry services, and hairdressers. Australia:\u00a0Restrictions have loosened in some states and the federal government is considering ending the nationwide lockdown early. In Queensland state, residents are   allowed to go out for recreational activities like picnics or boating. While people are still expected to observe social distancing, residents flocked outdoors today, eager for fresh air after weeks at home. Malaysia:\u00a0The country\u00a0will allow the majority of businesses to reopen Monday. Those that involve close contact like movie theaters or nightclubs will remain closed.\u00a0Malaysia has started rounding up undocumented immigrants to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

With so many lives at stake, it's time the United States looked to those countries in the Asia Pacific region that have successfully controlled the pandemic to figure out how to save ourselves and the economy. Several places in the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, have reported suppressing the\u00a0reproduction\u00a0number\u00a0-- the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person -- to below 1, without the need for continued, widespread lockdowns. They are now rapidly and successfully suppressing outbreaks of the disease by isolating those who are infected and their contacts who are likely to be infected.\u00a0 It's as if there are two worlds. How have these countries succeeded to date?\u00a0 Many have adopted nationwide public-health standards, using mobile technologies, professionalism of government, widespread use of face masks and hand sanitizers, and intensive public health services to isolate infected individuals or those likely to be infected.\u00a0 Testing has played an important role, but has not been the decider it is sometimes portrayed to be in the United States. Read the full opinion piece here Editors note: Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the\u00a0Center for Sustainable Development\u00a0at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more\u00a0opinion articles\u00a0on CNN. It's a popular argument heard at\u00a0protests denouncing state shutdowns, fueled by those who say news outlets are overreacting to coronavirus: The flu kills more people than coronavirus. Why shut down the economy for this? Here are several reasons why coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu -- and why extra precautions are needed: Coronavirus is much more contagious. A person with the\u00a0flu infects an average of about\u00a01.28 other people. A person with\u00a0novel\u00a0coronavirus infects an average of\u00a0about 2 to 3 other people. Coronavirus has killed at a much faster rate. Between October 2019 and early April 2020, the flu killed up to 331 people a day, according to the preliminary CDC numbers. From February 6 through\u00a0April 30, the coronavirus killed an average of more than 739 people per day in the US. Coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms. With the flu, people typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection, with\u00a0symptoms often showing up within two days, the CDC says. That means people will know they're sick fairly soon and will likely stay home. But with coronavirus, symptoms typically appear four or five days after exposure, and the incubation lasts up to 14 days. You can get a flu vaccine but not a coronavirus vaccine. Unlike the flu, there's no option to get a vaccine for the coronavirus to protect against infection or to reduce the severity of symptoms. At the earliest,\u00a0it'll be months\u00a0before a coronavirus vaccine might become publicly available. ##Health## New Zealand police have received more than 1,200 reports of people breaking restrictions on mass gatherings since the country's Level 3 alert went into effect last week.  Of those, 685 came in the 24-hour period between 6 p.m. local time on May 1 and May 2 , New Zealand police said in a statement.  \u201cUnder no circumstances should anyone be having a party under the Alert Level 3 restrictions. Such behavior could waste all the sacrifices made by our team of five million over the last five weeks,\u201d said Acting Assistant Commissioner Scott Fraser.\u00a0 Last Monday, New Zealand's toughest Level 4 restrictions were relaxed but the country is still effectively under lockdown under its Level 3 alert.  In the 24 hours between 6 p,m. May 1 and May 2, police took action against 112 people. Under Level 3, some 400,000 more New Zealanders can head back to work and 75% of the country's economy is operating, according to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. The  restrictions also mean that New Zealanders will be able to hold small funerals and buy takeaways. Ardern said the country has \"eliminated\" the virus after weeks of lockdown but has urged the public to remain vigilant.

Buffett, who has long been bullish on the US economy and stock market, spoke at the company's annual shareholder meeting from a virtually empty CHI Health Center in Omaha Saturday. The remarks were\u00a0webcast by Yahoo Finance. Buffett discussed prior times of hardship he's lived through, such as the Cuban missile crisis and the Cold War, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Great Recession of 2008. Every time it seemed that the future was bleak, he said, but America eventually recovered. He conceded that the coronavirus outbreak is a vastly different challenge than those other national emergencies. But he remains upbeat. \"This country, in 231 years, has exceeded anybody's dreams.\" Buffett said. Selling airline stakes: But the billionaire\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0CEO said the company recently sold its entire stakes in the four airline stocks that company had owned, calling it a mistake to invest in the industry. Berkshire Hathaway revealed in early April that it trimmed its stakes in\u00a0Delta\u00a0and\u00a0Southwest. But in response to a question from a Berkshire shareholder, Buffett said the company sold all its shares in Delta and Southwest, as well as\u00a0United and\u00a0American, because he believes it will take years for air travel to recover.
