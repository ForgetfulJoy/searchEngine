White House\u00a0\u00a0 Some political heavy hitters are publicly taking President Trump to task for his actions during and following his impeachment. Former chief of staff John Kelly defended Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, saying he did the right thing when he raised alarm bells following Trump's pivotal Ukraine call last year.\u00a0Then, when Trump insulted Kelly for his comments, former national security adviser John Bolton came to his ex-colleague's defense. Meanwhile, the situation with Attorney General William Barr and the Department of Justice's alleged interference in the sentencing of former Trump adviser Roger Stone took a left turn when Barr sharply rebuked the president, saying Trump's Twitter commentary on sensitive investigations makes it \"impossible\" to do his job. If the president longs for a friendly face after all of this, he's in luck: Former White House communications director Hope Hicks, a longtime Trump loyalist, is expected to return to the White House soon.\u00a0 2. Election 2020 Voters and Democratic candidates are preparing for the next leg of the campaign trail, which will involve contests in Nevada and South Carolina later in the month. Joe Biden is redeploying dozens of campaign staffers to the two states in hopes of regaining his footing following disappointing showings in New Hampshire and Iowa. In Nevada, the State Democratic Party has announced some last minute changes to their caucus structure in hopes of avoiding the vote reporting meltdown we saw in Iowa. In South Carolina, a different kind of planning is afoot: The state isn't holding a Republican primary this year, and under state law, GOP voters are allowed to cast ballots in the Democratic primary instead. This has led some Republicans to make plans to act as \"spoilers\" by throwing off the race results with their votes.\u00a0 3. Coronavirus\u00a0 The novel coronavirus probably isn't going anywhere for a long time.\u00a0CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said he thinks the epidemic could\u00a0last into next year, and CDC officials are preparing for the possibility of a widespread outbreak of the illness in the US. More than 64,000 people have now been infected by the disease, including at least 15 in the US. Medicals workers are particularly at risk.\u00a0China says more than\u00a01,700 frontline medics have been infected, and six have died. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has sacked several top officials over what Beijing sees as an inadequate response to the coronavirus threat.\u00a0 4. Taliban The US is close to forging a deal with Taliban leaders to implement\u00a0a seven day reduction in violence in Afghanistan, where the Islamist group is most prevalent. US officials are hoping the deal would quell overall violence in the region and help them execute President Trump's desire to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. Attacks from the Taliban and other anti-government forces have spiked over the last few months, making it harder for the US to fade out its presence. The deal would be conditional, though, and would require demonstrable peace efforts by the Taliban\u00a0before the US moves forward with further negotiations or withdraws\u00a0troops. 5. Seattle hospital deaths Seven children at the Seattle Children's Hospital have now died from a mold infection since 2001. In\u00a0the most recent case, a five-month-old infant had been battling an Aspergillus mold infection for months before passing away.\u00a0The hospital has experienced persistent Aspergillus mold problems, and had to shut down its main operating rooms in May and November of last year after the hospital detected the mold\u00a0in the air. Several families of sickened and deceased patients have joined a class action lawsuit against the hospital, alleging that hospital managers knew as early as 2005 that the transmission of Aspergillus into its premises could be related to its air-handling system. The hospital said it was \"incredibly sorry for the hurt experienced\" and out of respect for privacy\u00a0would not share details about its patients or comment on specific cases.
